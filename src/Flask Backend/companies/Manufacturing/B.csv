1,B,BARNES GROUP INC,2024-02-26,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
 Our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by any of the following risks. Our business could also be affected by additional risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. The below risks should be read in conjunction with Part II - Item 7 - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.""RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESSES AND THE INDUSTRIES WITHIN WHICH WE OPERATE We depend on revenues and earnings from a small number of significant customers. Any bankruptcy of or loss of or cancellation, reduction or delay in purchases by these customers could harm our business. Net sales to GE and its subsidiaries in 2023 accounted for 21% of our total sales and approximately 49% of Aerospace's net sales. Approximately 15% of Aerospace's net sales in 2023 were to its next four largest customers. Approximately 10% of Industrial's sales in 2023 were to its five largest customers. Some of our success will depend on the business strength and viability of those customers. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our largest customers. Some of our customers may in the future reduce their purchases due to economic conditions or shift their purchases from us to our competitors, in-house or to other sources. Some of our long-term sales agreements provide that the customer may unilaterally reduce or discontinue its projected purchases without penalty or terminate for convenience. The loss of one or more of our largest customers, any reduction, cancellation or delay in sales to these customers (including a reduction in aftermarket volume in our Aerospace Aftermarket business' Revenue Sharing Programs), our inability to successfully develop relationships with new customers, or future price concessions we make to retain customers could significantly reduce our sales and profitability. We may not recover all of our up-front costs related to new or existing programs. New programs may require significant up-front investments for capital equipment, engineering, inventory, design and tooling. As OEMs in the transportation and aerospace industries have looked to suppliers to bear increasing responsibility for the design, engineering and manufacture of systems and components, they have increasingly shifted the financial risk associated with those responsibilities to the suppliers as well. This trend may continue and is most evident in the area of engineering cost reimbursement. We cannot assure you that we will have adequate funds to make such up-front investments or to recover such costs from our customers as part of our product pricing or through sales volume. In such event, our profitability, liquidity and cash flows may be adversely affected. In addition, we incur costs and make capital expenditures for new program awards based upon certain estimates of production volumes and production complexity. While we attempt to recover such costs and capital expenditures by appropriately pricing our products, the prices of our products are based in part upon planned production volumes. If the actual production is significantly less than planned or significantly more complex than anticipated, we may be unable to recover such 5Table of Contents costs. In addition, because a significant portion of our overall costs is fixed, declines in our customers’ production levels can adversely affect the level of our reported profits even if our up-front investments are recovered.We may not realize all of the sales expected from our existing backlog or anticipated orders. At December 31, 2023, we had $1,530.2 million of order backlog, the majority of which related to Aerospace OEM customers, as compared with $1,020.3 million at the end of 2022. Of the 2023 year-end backlog, $1,257.3 million was attributable to Aerospace and $272.9 million was attributable to Industrial. Approximately 50% of the Company's consolidated year-end backlog is expected to be recognized during 2024, with the remainder scheduled to be recognized after 2024. There can be no assurances that the revenues projected in our backlog will be realized or, if realized, will result in profits. We consider backlog to be firm customer orders for future delivery. OEM customers may provide projections of components and assemblies that they anticipate purchasing in the future under existing programs. These projections may represent orders that are beyond lead time and are included in backlog when supported by a long term agreement. Our customers may have the right under certain circumstances or with certain penalties or consequences to terminate, reduce or defer firm orders that we have in backlog. If this occurs, we may be protected from certain costs and losses, but our sales will nevertheless be adversely affected. Although we strive to maintain strong relationships with our customers, there is an ongoing risk that orders may be canceled or rescheduled due to fluctuations in our customers’ business requirements. Also, our realization of sales from new and existing programs is inherently subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties, including whether our customers execute the launch of programs on time, or at all, the number of units that our customers actually produce, the timing of production and manufacturing insourcing decisions made by our customers. In addition, until firm orders are placed, our customers may have the right to discontinue a program or replace us with another supplier at any time without penalty. Our failure to realize sales from new and existing programs could have a material adverse effect on our net sales, results of operations and cash flows. We face risks of cost overruns and losses on fixed-price contracts and orders in backlog. We sell certain of our products under firm, fixed-price contracts providing for a fixed price for the products regardless of the production or purchase costs incurred by us, which includes certain orders in backlog, some of which have long lead times. The cost of producing and delivering products may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, outside processing, freight, shipping, overhead and other factors, including manufacturing inefficiencies. Such increased costs may result in cost overruns and losses on contracts. Original equipment manufacturers in the aerospace and transportation industries have significant pricing leverage over suppliers and may be able to achieve price reductions over time. Additionally, we may not be successful in our efforts to raise prices on our customers. While many of our customers permit periodic adjustments to pricing based on changes in component prices and other factors, we may bear the risk of price increases that occur between any such repricing or, if such repricing is not permitted, during the balance of the term of the particular customer contract. There is substantial and continuing pressure from OEMs in the aerospace and transportation industries, including automotive, to reduce the prices they pay to suppliers. We attempt to manage such downward pricing pressure, while trying to preserve our business relationships with our customers, by seeking to reduce our production costs through various measures, including purchasing raw materials and components at lower prices and implementing cost-effective process improvements. Our suppliers have periodically resisted, and in the future may resist, pressure to lower their prices and may seek to impose price increases. If we are unable to offset OEM price reductions, our profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, OEMs have substantial leverage in setting purchasing and payment terms, including the terms of accelerated payment programs under which payments are made prior to the account due date in return for an early payment discount. OEMs can unexpectedly change their purchasing policies and/or payment practices, which could have a negative impact on our short-term working capital. We operate in highly competitive markets. Our future growth is dependent upon our ability to bring to market competitive, and increasingly complex, new products and services that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins. Our two global business segments compete with a number of larger and smaller companies in the markets we serve. Some of our competitors have greater financial, production, research and development, or other resources than we do. Within Aerospace, certain of our OEM customers compete with our repair and overhaul business, and some compete with us where they have the ability to manufacture the components and assemblies that we supply to them but have chosen, for capacity limitations, cost considerations or other reasons, to outsource the manufacturing to us. Our customers award business based on, among other things, price, quality, reliability of supply, service, technology and design. Our competitors’ efforts to grow market share could exert downward pressure on our product pricing and margins. Our competitors may also develop products or services, or methods of delivering those products or services, that are superior to ours. In addition, our competitors may adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with our existing or future competitors. 6Table of Contents The industries in which we operate have been experiencing consolidation, both in our suppliers and the customers we serve. Supplier consolidation is in part attributable to OEMs more frequently awarding long-term sole source or preferred supplier contracts to the most capable suppliers in an effort to reduce the total number of suppliers. If consolidation of our existing competitors or customers occurs, we would expect the competitive pressures we face to increase, and we cannot assure you that our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows will not be adversely impacted as a result.Our operations focus on highly engineered components which require extensive engineering and research and development time. Moreover, our ability to develop new products and services and to compete successfully will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to make investments of significant resources. These efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, may not lead to the development of new products or services on a timely basis, and may require us to reduce costs by such means as reducing excess capacity, improving productivity, eliminating redundancies and increasing production in low-cost countries. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, in optimizing our manufacturing footprint in low-cost countries. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or that we will be successful in maintaining our competitive position. If we are unable to differentiate our products and services or maintain a low-cost footprint, we may lose market share or be forced to reduce prices, thereby lowering our margins. Our competitive advantage may be adversely impacted if we cannot continue to introduce new products ahead of our competition, or if our products are rendered obsolete by other products or by new, different technologies and processes. The success of our new products will depend on a number of factors, including innovation, customer acceptance, the efficiency of our suppliers in providing materials and component parts, and the performance and quality of our products relative to those of our competitors. Additionally, we may face increased or unexpected costs associated with new product introduction, including the use of additional resources such as personnel and capital. We cannot provide assurance that we will not experience new product introduction delays in the future. As we introduce new products, we may be unable to detect and correct defects in product design. Even after introduction, new or enhanced products may not satisfy customer preferences and product failures may cause customers to reject our products. As a result, these products may not achieve market acceptance and our brand image could suffer. Any such occurrences could significantly reduce our revenues, increase our operating costs, or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The development of new products and services presents security risks. An increasing number of our products and services are delivered with digital capabilities and the accompanying interconnected device networks, some of which include sensors, data, and advanced computing capabilities. If we are unable to manage the lifecycle cybersecurity risk in development, deployment and operation of our digital platforms and services, the possible consequences include financial loss, reputational damage, exposure to legal claims or enforcement actions, theft of intellectual property, the diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.A significant portion of the sales of certain businesses within our Industrial segment are realized from the design, manufacture, distribution and service of highly-engineered and customized products and systems for plastic injection molding and plastics processing across a broad spectrum of applications. Sales volume is dependent upon the need for equipment used to produce plastic products, which may be significantly influenced by the demand for plastic products, the capital investment needs of companies in the plastic injection molding and plastics processing industries, changes in technological advances, and changes in laws or regulations such as those related to single-use plastics, product and packaging composition, and recycling. Decrease in demand for plastic products or equipment used in the production of plastic products or unfavorable developments in these industries generally could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Demand for our defense-related products depends on government spending. A portion of Aerospace's sales is derived from defense markets, including single-sourced and dual-sourced sales. The defense market is largely dependent upon government budgets and is subject to governmental appropriations. Although multi-year contracts may be authorized in connection with major procurements, funds are generally appropriated on a fiscal year basis even though a program may be expected to continue for several years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded and additional funds are committed only as further appropriations are made. We cannot assure you that maintenance of or increases in defense spending will be allocated to programs that would benefit our business. Moreover, we cannot assure you that new defense-related aircraft programs in which we participate will enter full-scale production as expected. A decrease in levels of defense spending or the government’s termination of, or failure to fully fund, one or more of the contracts for the programs in which we participate, including due to a government shutdown, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.7Table of Contents The aerospace industry is highly regulated. Complications related to aerospace regulations may adversely affect the Company. A substantial portion of our income is derived from our aerospace businesses. The aerospace industry is highly regulated in the U.S. by the Federal Aviation Administration and in other countries by similar regulatory agencies. We must be certified by these agencies and, in some cases, by individual OEMs in order to engineer, produce and service systems and components used in specific aircraft models. If material authorizations or approvals are delayed, suspended or revoked, our business could be adversely affected. In the future, new or more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted or industry oversight heightened, and we may incur significant expenses to comply with any such new regulations or heightened industry oversight. Fluctuations in the price of jet fuel, resins, energy and other raw materials and their availability may impact our operating results. Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of operating expenses for companies in the aerospace industry. Fluctuations in fuel costs could impact levels and frequency of aircraft maintenance and overhaul activities, and airlines' decisions on maintaining, deferring or canceling new aircraft purchases, in part based on the value associated with new fuel efficient technologies. Increases in fuel prices can also increase our packaging and transportation costs. Both we and our customers purchase supplies of resins, which are oil-based components used in the manufacture of certain products, and any significant increases in resin costs could adversely impact future operating results, including as a result of customers' decisions on maintaining, deferring or canceling new programs. Weather-related events, natural disasters, political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, changes in governmental policy concerning aircraft fuel production, changes in refining capacity, and other unpredictable events may result in future fuel supply shortages and fuel price increases. For example, widespread disruption to oil production, refinery operations and pipeline capacity in certain areas of the U.S. can impact the price of jet fuel significantly. Geopolitical conflicts, such as conflicts in the Middle East, an important source of oil for the U.S. and other countries where we do business, and the Russia-Ukraine war, cause prices for fuel and energy to be volatile and availability to be impacted. In addition, new laws or regulations adopted in response to climate change could increase energy and transportation costs, as well as the costs of certain raw materials and components. In recent years, the costs of certain raw materials, transportation and energy necessary for our operations and the production and distribution of our products have increased significantly. While we have implemented cost containment measures and selective price increases, as well as taken other actions to offset these inflationary pressures in our supply chain, we may not be able to completely offset all the increases in our operational costs, and there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING A GLOBAL BUSINESS AND REGULATORY RISKSOur operations depend on our global manufacturing, sales and service facilities and information systems which are subject to physical, environmental, operational and other risks that could disrupt our operations. We have a significant number of manufacturing facilities, technical service centers, and sales and distribution centers both within and outside the U.S. The global scope of our business subjects us to increased risks and uncertainties such as threats of war, terrorism and instability of governments, and economic, regulatory and legal systems in countries in which we or our customers conduct business. In addition, our customers' and suppliers' facilities, as well as our own facilities, are located in areas that may be affected by natural disasters, including earthquakes, windstorms, droughts and floods, or by limited accessibility to sufficient water resources, which could cause significant physical damage and disruption to our equipment and facilities, as well as the infrastructure of our customers and suppliers, and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, some of our manufacturing equipment and tooling is custom-made and is not readily replaceable. Loss of such equipment or tooling could have a negative impact on our manufacturing capabilities and, as a result, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. A major catastrophe such as an earthquake, windstorm, drought, flood or other natural disaster, infectious disease outbreak, significant labor strikes, work stoppages, or political unrest, in any of the areas where we or our customers or key suppliers conduct operations could result in a prolonged interruption of our business. Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in the manufacture or shipment of products or the provision of repair and other services that may result in our loss of sales and customers. Although we have obtained property damage and business interruption insurance, our insurance will not cover all potential risks, and we cannot assure you that we will have adequate insurance to compensate us for all losses that result from any insured risks. Any material loss not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We cannot assure you that insurance will be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us or at a cost that will not have a material adverse effect on our profitability, net income and cash flows.The global nature of our operations subjects us to financial and regulatory risks in the countries in which we and our customers, suppliers and other business partners operate. In addition, we sell and may in the future sell our products and services to the U.S. and foreign governments and in foreign countries. As a global business, we are subject to complex laws, regulations and other conditions in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate, and associated risks, including: U.S.-imposed embargoes of sales to specific countries; foreign import controls; import regulations and duties; export regulations 8Table of Contents (which require us to comply with stringent licensing regimes); reporting requirements regarding the use of ""conflict"" minerals mined from certain countries; anti-dumping regulations; unclaimed property laws; price and currency controls; dividend remittance restrictions; expropriation of assets; war, civil uprisings and riots; government instability; government-imposed economic uncertainties, such as a prolonged U.S. federal government shutdown; government contracting requirements including cost accounting standards and various procurement, security and audit requirements, as well as requirements to certify to the government compliance with these requirements; the necessity of obtaining governmental approval for new and continuing products and operations; and legal systems or decrees, laws, taxes, regulations, interpretations and court decisions that are not always fully developed and that may be retroactively or arbitrarily applied. In the past, we have inadvertently violated some of these regulations, including export regulations and regulations prohibiting sales of certain products, none of which has had or, we believe, will have a material adverse effect on our business. Any significant violations of these or other regulations in the future could result in civil or criminal sanctions, suspension of production, loss of export or other licenses, other restrictions on our operations or damage to our reputation. We may also be subject to unanticipated income taxes, excise and custom duties, import taxes, export taxes, value added taxes, or other governmental assessments, and taxes may be impacted by changes in legislation in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, our organizational and capital structure may limit our ability to transfer funds between countries without incurring adverse tax consequences. Any of these events could result in a loss of business or other unexpected costs that could reduce sales or profits and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are subject to environmental laws and regulations and the risk of environmental liabilities, violations and litigation. We are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the health and safety of our employees, the generation, storage, use, transportation and disposal of certain materials including hazardous materials, emissions or discharges of substances into the environment, and investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites. Our operations involve the use, primarily in our manufacturing processes, of substances subject to these laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities; suspension of production; alteration of our manufacturing; damage to our reputation; and restrictions on our operations or sales. Furthermore, environmental laws outside of the U.S. are becoming more stringent, resulting in increased costs and compliance burdens. In addition, certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at their properties or at properties from or upon which they have disposed of hazardous substances. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims based on alleged presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances. The ultimate cost of site cleanup and timing of future cash outflows is difficult to predict, given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods.The costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations, or liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances, may exceed our estimates, or have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.Climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change, may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations. Climate change resulting from increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could present risks to our future operations from natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, wildfires, droughts or flooding. Such extreme weather conditions could pose physical risks to our facilities and disrupt operation of our supply chain and may impact operational costs. The impacts of climate change on global water resources may result in water scarcity, which could in the future impact our ability to access sufficient quantities of water in certain locations and result in increased costs. Concern over climate change will likely result in new legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change. Further, our customers and the markets we serve may impose emissions reduction or other environmental standards and requirements, including plastic injection molding and plastics processing and conventional fuel-based automotive markets. As a result, we may experience increased compliance burdens and operational costs and raw material sourcing, manufacturing operations and the distribution of our products may be adversely affected. Moreover, we may not be able to timely meet these requirements due to the required level of capital investment or technological advancement. While we have been committed to continuous improvements to meet anticipated regulations and preferences, there can be no assurance that our commitments will be successful, that our products will be accepted by the market, that proposed regulations will not have a negative competitive impact or that economic returns will reflect our investments in new product development. There also continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. These factors may impact the demand for, or obsolescence of, certain of our products, and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.9Table of Contents We are committed to reducing our carbon emissions, water consumption and waste generation, which may require us to expend significant resources that could increase our operational costs. Further, there can be no assurance of the extent to which any of our commitments will be achieved, or that any future investments we make in furtherance of achieving such targets and goals will meet investor expectations or any binding or non-binding legal standards regarding sustainability performance. Moreover, we may determine that it is in the best interest of our Company and our stockholders to prioritize other business, social, governance or sustainability investments over the achievement of our current commitments based on economic, regulatory and social factors, business strategy or pressure from investors, activist groups or other stakeholders. If we are unable to meet these commitments, then we could incur adverse publicity and reaction from investors, activist groups or other stakeholders, which could adversely impact the perception of us and our products and services by current and potential customers, as well as investors, which could in turn adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA"") and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws and data privacy and security laws. The FCPA and similar anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining an unfair advantage. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Our operations outside the United States, including in developing countries, expose us to the risk of such violations. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. Despite our training and compliance program, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations, or allegations, could damage our reputation, as well as result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties, termination of relationships with business partners and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions, and as a result might materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Additionally, to conduct our operations, we regularly move data across borders, and consequently we are subject to a variety of increasingly complex and changing laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, use, transmission and protection of personal information and other customer, vendor or employee data. The interpretation and enforcement of such laws and regulations, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, continue to develop and there is significant uncertainty with respect to how compliance with these laws and regulations may evolve and the costs and complexity of future compliance. Violations could result in substantial fines, sanctions or civil penalties, and damage to our reputation and might materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.International trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position. Our results could be impacted by changes in tariffs, trade agreements, sanctions or other trade restrictions imposed or agreed to by the U.S. or foreign governments. For example, a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or imposition of trade regulations in response to war or other global crises could have a negative impact on our results of operations due to their impact on commodity pricing and supply chains. Trade restrictions, including withdrawal from or modification of existing trade agreements, negotiation of new trade agreements, and imposition of new (and retaliatory) tariffs against certain countries or covering certain products has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, customers, suppliers and/or the U.S. or foreign economies or certain sectors thereof in which we compete, and impair our ability to expand our business by offering new technologies, products and services. It remains unclear what the U.S. federal government or foreign governments will or will not do in the future with respect to tariffs or other international trade agreements and policies. Trade restrictions, and changes in or uncertainty surrounding global trade policies, may adversely impact our competitive position, businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The global nature of our business exposes us to foreign currency fluctuations that have affected and may continue to affect our future revenues, debt levels and profitability. As noted above, we have manufacturing facilities and technical service centers, and sales and distribution centers around the world, and the majority of our foreign operations use the local currency as their functional currency. These include, among others, the Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, Czech koruna, Euro, Malaysian ringgit, Mexican peso, New Taiwan dollar, Polish zloty, Singaporean dollar, Swedish krona, and the Swiss franc. Since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies expose us to translation risk when the local currency financial statements are translated to U.S. dollars. Changes in currency exchange rates may also expose us to transaction risk. We may buy hedges in certain currencies to reduce or offset our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations; however, these transactions may not be adequate or effective to protect us against unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations. We have not engaged in any speculative hedging activities. Currency fluctuations have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our revenues and profitability in the future. 10Table of Contents RISKS RELATED TO SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURINGThe ability of suppliers to deliver raw materials, parts and components and energy resources, and our ability to manufacture without disruption, could affect our results of operations. We use a wide range of materials (including steel, stainless steel, titanium, aluminum, Inconel, Hastelloys and other specialty materials) and components (including semiconductors and other electronic components) in the global production of our products, which come from numerous suppliers around the world. Our operations and those of our suppliers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including transportation delays, work stoppages, labor shortages, price inflation, financial issues such as supplier bankruptcy, information technology failures, and hazards such as fire, earthquakes, flooding, droughts or other natural disasters, new laws or regulations, global economic or political events including terrorist attacks and war, and suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers. Because not all of our business arrangements provide for guaranteed supply, and some key raw materials, parts and components and energy resources may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers, we are subject to supply and pricing risk. For example, we expect to continue to be impacted by supply chain issues due to economic, political, geopolitical and other factors largely beyond our control, increased material costs and component shortages, supply chain disruptions and delays, and cost inflation, all of which could continue or escalate in the future. The effects of climate change, including extreme weather events, long-term changes in temperature levels, water availability, supply costs impacted by increasing energy costs, or energy costs impacted by carbon prices or offsets may exacerbate these risks. Such disruptions could interrupt our ability to manufacture certain products and result in increased pricing, and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Any product liability, warranty, contractual or other claims may harm our business or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. We are exposed to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of our products and the products we buy from third parties and sell to our customers, and to potential warranty, contractual or other claims. Our products are complex and may contain defects, errors, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance, due to any number of issues, including issues in materials, design, fabrication, packaging and/or use within a system or item of equipment. Further, because of the complexity of our products, defects or errors might only be detected when the products are in use. Development of new products increases complexity and adds risk to manufacturing reliability, and increases the likelihood of product defects or errors. Risks associated with product defects are exacerbated by the fact that our customers typically integrate our products into other equipment and systems. Our products may be responsible for critical functions in our customers’ products. Failure of our products to perform to specifications, or other product defects, could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell to our customers, the equipment and/or systems into which our products are integrated and to the end users of such equipment/and or systems. Such defects could give rise to warranty claims or claims under indemnification clauses in our agreements, which may range from individual customer claims to full recalls of all products in the field, and result in significant costs, including costs related to developing solutions, recalling products, inspecting, repairing or replacing defective products, writing down defective inventory, or attorney's fees and could result in the loss of sales and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts. In addition, defects in our products could result in failure to achieve market acceptance, a loss of participation in customer programs, a shifting of business to our competitors, and litigation or regulatory action against us, and could harm our reputation, our relationships with customers and our ability to attract new customers, as well as the perceptions of our brands. Other potential adverse impacts of product defects include shipment delays, write-offs of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, and losses on unfavorable purchase commitments. Moreover, the occurrence of defects may give rise to product liability claims, particularly if defects in our products or the products into which they are integrated result in personal injury or death, and could result in significant costs, expenses and losses. For example, we may be exposed to potential liability for personal injury, property damage or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft or automotive component designed, manufactured or sold by us, or the failure of an aircraft or automotive component that has been serviced by us or of the components themselves. If a product liability claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant, and could divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business, even if we are successful. We may be named in product liability claims even if there is no evidence that our products caused the damage in question, and even though we may have indemnity from our customers, and such claims could result in significant costs and expenses. We vigorously defend ourselves in connection with these matters. We cannot, however, assure you that the costs, charges and liabilities associated with these matters will not be material, or that those costs, charges and liabilities will not exceed any amounts reserved for them in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Further, while we have liability insurance for certain risks, our insurance may not cover all liabilities, including potential reputational impacts. Additionally, insurance coverage may not be available in the future on acceptable terms or at a cost acceptable to us. The above is exacerbated by the fact that our products may be used, and perform critical functions, in various high-risk applications such as aerospace, automobiles, and robotics, among others. Accordingly, defects in our products could have an adverse impact on us, on our customers and the end 11Table of Contents users of our customers’ products. If any of these risks materialize, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.RISKS RELATED TO HUMAN CAPITALOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract, develop, engage and retain qualified employees. Our executive officers and key management personnel are critical to driving business performance and successfully executing the Company’s growth strategy. Because of the complex nature of many of our products and services, and our focus on technological and product innovations, we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilled workforce, including our engineering talent and our sales professionals. We manage human capital through our Talent Management System, which is aimed at enhancing our ability to attract and hire talented employees, as well as supporting their growth, development and engagement; however, we cannot guarantee the system's effectiveness. Failure to attract, develop, engage and retain qualified employees, whether as a result of an insufficient number of qualified applicants, difficulty in recruiting new employees, or inadequate resources to train, integrate and retain qualified employees, could impair our ability to execute our business strategy, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, while we aim to reduce the impact of the departure of employees, our operations or ability to execute our business strategy have been impacted and may continue to be impacted by the loss of employees, particularly when departures involve groups of employees, such as restructuring and workforce reduction actions. Such losses may adversely affect the Company through decreased employee morale, the loss of knowledge of departing employees, and the devotion of resources to reorganizing and reassigning job roles and responsibilities, and could increase the risk of claims or litigation from former employees.Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted by strikes or work stoppages. We employ approximately 6,500 people worldwide. Approximately 20% of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, trade union agreements and/or national industry agreements. Although we believe that our relations with our employees and labor unions that represent our employees are good, and we have experienced no material strikes or work stoppages recently, we cannot assure you that we will not experience in the future these and other types of conflicts with labor unions, works councils, other groups representing employees or our employees generally, nor that any future negotiations with our labor unions will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor, including healthcare, pensions or other benefits. Any potential strikes or work stoppages, and the resulting adverse impact on our relationships with customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Similarly, a protracted strike or work stoppage at any of our major customers, suppliers or other vendors could materially adversely affect our business.RISKS RELATED TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, CYBERSECURITY AND DATA PRIVACYAny disruption or failure in the operation of our information systems, including from conversions or integrations of information technology (“IT”) or reporting systems, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our IT systems are an integral part of our business. We depend on our IT systems to help communicate internally and externally, and to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities, such as processing orders, managing inventory, making payments, collecting accounts receivable, and storing information. In addition, our IT systems allow us to purchase, sell and ship products timely and efficiently, to maintain cost-effective operations, and to provide superior service to our customers. Moreover, we use IT systems to record, process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. We periodically implement, upgrade and integrate IT systems, such as our enterprise resource planning (""ERP"") and customer relationship management (“CRM”) platforms across our businesses. If we experience a problem with the functioning of an important IT system as a result of the increased burden placed on our IT infrastructure or a security breach or a service issue experienced by an external third party vendor that stores or processes our data, including during system upgrades and/or new system implementations, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business or operating results.Increased cybersecurity requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted IT-related crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, data and services and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In the ordinary course of our business, we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information in our data centers and on our networks. In addition to utilizing non-cloud environments, we also leverage cloud-based systems, where data is stored and exchanged with external third party vendors. The secure maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our business operations. Despite our security measures, our IT systems and infrastructure, including vendor-hosted systems, may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to 12Table of Contents employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. These cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to IT systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company, its products, its customers and/or its third-party service providers, including cloud providers. These threats and incidents originate from many sources globally and include malwares that take the form of computer viruses, ransomware, worms, Trojan horses, spyware, adware, scareware, rogue software, and other programs that act against the computer user. Our customers are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections, and we have incurred and may continue to incur additional costs to comply with such demands. While we deploy measures to deter, prevent, detect, respond to and mitigate these threats, including identity and access controls and vulnerability assessments, despite these efforts, cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could compromise our networks and the information stored there, including critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties), could be accessed, altered, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Such incidents could remain undetected for an extended period of time, and the losses arising from such incidents could exceed our available insurance coverage for such matters. Such incidents could also disrupt our operations, impacting manufacturing production and transactional processing, and result in increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, theft of intellectual property, and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position. Further, cybersecurity and data protection laws and regulations continue to evolve in the U.S. and worldwide. This adds compliance complexity and may increase our costs of compliance and expose us to litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions or fines in one or more jurisdictions. In addition, as security threats continue to evolve and increase in frequency and sophistication, we will likely be required to invest in additional resources to protect the security of our IT systems.RISKS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights. Our intellectual property rights may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage, and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. As patents expire, we could face increased competition, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Infringement of our intellectual property and other proprietary rights by a third party, or copying of our technology in countries where we do not hold patents, could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities. We cannot be certain that the measures we have implemented will prevent our intellectual property from being improperly disclosed, challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. For example, competitors may avoid infringement liability by developing non-infringing competing technologies or by effectively concealing infringement. We have spent and expect to continue to spend significant resources monitoring and enforcing our intellectual property rights and we may not be aware of or able to detect or prove infringement by third parties. Our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the protection and enforceability of those rights in some countries. If we seek to enforce our intellectual property rights, we may be subject to claims that those rights are invalid or unenforceable, and others may seek counterclaims against us, which could have a negative impact on our business. In addition, changes in intellectual property laws or their interpretation may impact our ability to protect and assert our intellectual property rights, increase costs and uncertainties in the prosecution of patent applications and enforcement or defense of issued patents, and diminish the value of our intellectual property. If we do not protect and enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, or if they are circumvented, invalidated, or rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, it could have an adverse impact on our competitive position and our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our employees, consultants and other parties are subject to confidentiality obligations, but this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation, theft, misuse, disclosure, loss or destruction of our proprietary information and/or infringement of our intellectual property. For example, employees and former employees, in particular former employees who become employees of our competitors, may misappropriate, use, publish or provide to our competitors, customers or other third parties our intellectual property, advantageous know-how or other proprietary information. Similarly, we provide access to certain of our intellectual property and other proprietary information to our direct and indirect customers and certain of our consultants who may wrongfully use or disclose such intellectual property or information. Any of these events could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, cause us to lose business, damage our reputation, subject us to legal or regulatory proceedings, cause us to incur other loss or liability and otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. Regardless of the merit of such claims, any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming to defend and resolve due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation, and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. A claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement, which might not be available under 13Table of Contents acceptable terms or at all, require us to redesign our products, which would be costly and time-consuming, or subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against the development and sale of certain of our products or services. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement. In addition, we may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets and other confidential business information. Any such incidents and claims could severely harm our business and reputation, result in significant expenses, harm our competitive position, and prevent us from selling certain products and services, all of which could have a significant adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. RISKS RELATED TO LIQUIDITY AND OTHER RISKS We have significant indebtedness that could affect our operations and financial condition, and our failure to meet certain financial covenants required by our debt agreements may materially and adversely affect our assets, financial position and cash flows. At December 31, 2023, we had consolidated debt obligations of $1,290.8 million, representing approximately 49% of our total capital (indebtedness plus stockholders’ equity) as of that date. Our level of indebtedness, proportion of variable rate debt obligations and the significant debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness may adversely affect our operations and financial condition. For example, our indebtedness could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, investments in technology and research and development, acquisitions, dividends and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industries in which we compete; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors, some of whom have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources than we do; limit our ability to borrow additional funds; or increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. In addition, a majority of our debt arrangements require us to maintain certain debt and interest coverage ratios and limit our ability to incur debt, make investments or undertake certain other business activities. These requirements could limit our ability to obtain future financing and may prevent us from taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. Our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our debt arrangements may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the restrictions could result in an event of default under our debt arrangements which, in turn, could result in an event of default under the terms of our other indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our debt arrangements, after the expiration of any grace periods, our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our debt arrangements, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to happen, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the payments due under those arrangements or our other indebtedness or that we could find alternative financing to replace that indebtedness. Conditions in the worldwide credit markets may limit our ability to expand our credit lines beyond current bank commitments. In addition, our profitability has been and may continue to be adversely affected as a result of increases in interest rates. At December 31, 2023, we and our subsidiaries had $1,290.8 million aggregate principal amount of consolidated debt obligations outstanding, of which approximately 33% had interest rates that float with the market (not hedged against interest rate fluctuations). A 100 basis point increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in effect at December 31, 2023 would result in an approximate $4.3 million annualized increase in interest expense.A downgrade in our credit ratings could increase our cost of funding and/or adversely affect our access to funding. Our credit ratings are important to our cost and availability of capital. The major rating agencies evaluate our credit profile and assign credit ratings to us. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, which include financial strength, business and financial risk, transparency with rating agencies, and timeliness of financial reporting. Further leveraging our capital structure could result in a downgrade to our credit ratings. A downgrade to our credit rating could expose us to less favorable interest rates, harm our reputation, and make our debt less attractive to lenders. As such, failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funding and our liquidity by limiting the access to capital markets or the availability of funding from a variety of lenders. We have significant goodwill and an impairment of our goodwill could cause a decline in our net worth. Our total assets include substantial goodwill. At December 31, 2023, our goodwill totaled $1,183.6 million. The goodwill results from our prior acquisitions, representing the excess of the purchase price we paid over the net assets of the companies acquired. We assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill during each calendar year or more frequently if an event or change in circumstances indicates that the fair value of a reporting unit has been reduced below its carrying value. If future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units does not meet expectations or fair values fall due to significant stock market declines, we may be required to reflect an incremental non-cash charge to operating results for goodwill impairment. During the year ended December 31, 2022, management recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $68.2 million related to the Automation reporting unit as the estimated fair value of the reporting unit declined below its carrying value. See Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company performed its annual assessment during 14Table of Contents the second quarter of 2023 and has continued to evaluate macro-economic conditions through December 31, 2023. Based on our subsequent assessments, there was no additional impairment of goodwill during 2023. In the event there are future adverse changes in our estimated future cash flows and/or changes in key assumptions, including but not limited to discount rates, revenue growth or margins, and/or terminal growth rates, we may be required to record additional non-cash impairment charges to Automation goodwill. The recognition of an additional impairment of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material. See “Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates.” We may not realize all of the intangible assets related to the Aerospace Aftermarket businesses. We participate in aftermarket RSPs under which we receive an exclusive right to supply designated aftermarket parts over the life of the related aircraft engine program to our customer, GE. As consideration, we pay participation fees, which are recorded as intangible assets and are recognized as a reduction of sales over the estimated life of the related engine programs. Our total investments in participation fees under our RSPs as of December 31, 2023 equaled $299.5 million, all of which have been paid. At December 31, 2023, the remaining unamortized balance of these participation fees was $123.4 million. We entered into CRPs, also with GE, which provide for, among other items, the right to sell certain aftermarket component repair services for CFM56, CF6, CF34 and LM engines directly to other customers over the life of the engine program as one of a few GE licensed suppliers. In addition, the CRPs extended certain contracts under which the Company currently provides these services directly to GE. Our total investments in CRPs as of December 31, 2023 equaled $111.8 million, all of which have been paid. At December 31, 2023, the remaining unamortized balance of the CRPs was $62.3 million. We recorded the CRP payments as intangible assets which are recognized as a reduction of sales over the remaining useful life of these engine programs.The realizability of each asset is dependent upon future revenues related to the programs' aftermarket parts and services and is subject to impairment testing if circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. The potential exists that actual revenues will not meet expectations due to a change in market conditions, including, for example, the replacement of older engines with new, more fuel-efficient engines or our ability to maintain market share within the aftermarket business. A shortfall in future revenues may result in the failure to realize the net amount of the investments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, profitability could be impacted by the amortization of the participation fees and licenses, and the expiration of the international tax incentives on these programs. See “Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates.” We carry significant inventories and a loss in net realizable value could cause a decline in our net worth. At December 31, 2023, our inventories totaled $365.2 million. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value based on management's judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels, quantities and prices at which such inventories will be sold in the normal course of business. Accelerating the disposal process or changes in estimates of future sales potential may necessitate future reduction to inventory values. See “Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates.” We maintain pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the U.S. and certain international locations. Our costs of providing defined benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on the plans’ assets, interest rates, exchange rate fluctuations, future governmental regulation, global fixed income and equity prices, and our required and/or voluntary contributions to the plans. Declines in the stock market, prevailing interest rates, declines in discount rates, improvements in mortality rates and rising medical costs may cause an increase in our pension and other postretirement benefit expenses in the future and result in reductions in our pension fund asset values and increases in our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. These changes have caused and may continue to cause a significant reduction in our net worth and without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans’ assets, and depending upon the other factors listed above, we could be required to increase funding for some or all of these pension and postretirement plans. Changes in taxation requirements could affect our financial results. Our products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions in which we operate. Increases in indirect taxes could affect our products’ affordability and therefore reduce our sales. We are also subject to income tax in numerous jurisdictions in which we generate revenues. Changes in tax laws, tax rates or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. Among other things, our tax liabilities are affected by the mix of pretax income or loss among the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and the potential repatriation of foreign earnings to the U.S. Further, during the ordinary course of business, we are subject to examination by the various tax authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate which could result in an unanticipated increase in taxes. Any potential changes or interpretive guidance may impact current and deferred income tax 15Table of Contents expense and deferred tax balances for U.S operations as well as the potential future repatriation of foreign income. The impact of any proposed changes in tax regulations may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Changes in accounting guidance could affect our financial results. New accounting guidance that may become applicable to us from time to time, or changes in the interpretations of existing guidance, could have a significant effect on our reported results for the affected periods. Adoption of new accounting guidance could have a material impact on our financial statements and may retroactively affect the accounting treatment of transactions completed before adoption. See Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.Actions of activist stockholders could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management’s attention and resources, and have an adverse effect on our business. From time to time, we may be subject to proposals by stockholders urging us to take certain corporate actions. Activist stockholder activity could have an adverse effect on our business as responding to proxy contests and reacting to other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees. For example, we may be required to retain the services of various professionals to advise us on activist stockholder matters, including legal, financial, and communications advisers, the costs of which may negatively impact our future financial results. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy or leadership created as a consequence of activist stockholder initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, harm our ability to attract new investors, customers, and employees, and cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation. RISKS RELATED TO PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES Risks associated with our portfolio optimization efforts, including as a result of restructuring, acquisitions and divestitures, may adversely affect us. As described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have been executing a comprehensive business transformation strategy to rationalize our portfolio and generate improved growth, profitability, and cash flow. These portfolio optimization efforts may expose us to unknown risks, liabilities and fluctuations in quarterly results. In addition, implementation of our portfolio optimization efforts may divert management’s attention from day-to-day business operations and other business concerns or otherwise disrupt our business. Any of these risks may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We are subject to risks relating to the acquisition of MB Aerospace. We expect to incur significant costs in connection with the integration, which may exceed those currently anticipated; and we have incurred significant additional indebtedness in connection with the acquisition, which has increased our interest expense and financial leverage. Any of the foregoing risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and negatively impact the value of our securities. Challenges arising from our expanded operations as a result of the acquisition of MB Aerospace may affect our future results. The acquisition of MB Aerospace greatly expanded the size and complexity of our aerospace business. Our future success depends, in part, on the ability to integrate MB Aerospace with our existing aerospace business, and to anticipate and overcome challenges arising from the expansion and integration of our operations, including challenges related to expanded global operations and new manufacturing processes and products or services, and the associated costs and complexity. There can be no assurance that we will be able to anticipate or overcome all of the challenges resulting from our expanding operations or that we will be able to successfully integrate the MB Aerospace business or realize the expected benefits of the acquisitions within the intended timeframe or at all, which may cause our future results to be adversely affected.Our restructuring and integration actions could have long-term adverse effects on our business. As we implement restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, we may not achieve expected cost savings from workforce reductions or restructuring activities and actual charges, costs and adjustments due to these actions may vary materially from our estimates. In addition, our consolidation and integration activities may not provide the expected benefits. Our ability to realize anticipated cost savings, synergies and revenue enhancements may be affected by a number of factors, including the following: our ability to effectively eliminate duplicative back office overhead and overlapping personnel, rationalize manufacturing capacity, synchronize IT systems, consolidate warehousing and other facilities and shift production to more economical facilities; significant cash and non-cash integration and implementation costs or charges in order to achieve those cost savings, which could offset any such savings; and our ability to avoid labor disruption in connection with these activities. In addition, delays in implementing planned restructuring, consolidation or integration activities or other productivity improvements may diminish the expected operational or financial benefits. Our acquisition and other strategic initiatives, some of which may be outside the industries in which we currently operate, may not be successful. We have made a number of acquisitions in the past, and we anticipate that we may, from time to time, acquire additional businesses, assets or securities of companies, and enter into joint ventures and other strategic 16Table of Contents relationships that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our businesses. These activities expose the Company to a number of risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of any of which could materially adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. A portion of the industries that we serve are mature industries. As a result, our future growth may depend in part on the successful acquisition and integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations. On the other hand, if we acquire a company that operates in an industry that is different from the ones in which we currently operate, our lack of experience with that company's industry could have a material adverse impact on our ability to manage that business and realize the benefits of that acquisition. We may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions, obtain financing on satisfactory terms, negotiate reasonable terms, properly perform due diligence and determine all the significant risks associated with a particular acquisition, avoid diversion of our management's attention from other important business activities, or obtain regulatory approvals or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future. We could have difficulties integrating acquired businesses with our existing operations, including coordinating and consolidating separate systems, retaining market acceptance of acquired products and services, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees, and implementing our enterprise resource planning systems and operational procedures and disciplines. Any such difficulties may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with employees, customers, business partners and suppliers. In addition, even if integration is successful, the financial performance of acquired businesses may not be as expected and there can be no assurance that we will realize anticipated benefits from our acquisitions. We cannot assure you that we will effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business or product offerings or realize anticipated operational synergies. These activities may result in difficulties, significant expense and accounting charges, disrupt our business or divert management’s time and attention.Acquisitions involve numerous other risks, including potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business. Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired businesses require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the business operations before we acquired it. However, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial condition. In connection with acquisitions or joint venture investments outside the U.S., we may enter into derivative contracts to purchase foreign currency in order to hedge against the risk of foreign currency fluctuations in connection with such acquisitions or joint venture investments, which subjects us to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations associated with such derivative contracts. Additionally, our final determinations and appraisals of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions may vary materially from earlier estimates. We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment, and we cannot be certain that our business, operating results and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected. A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to any purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to retain, reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business, and collect the proceeds from any divestitures. In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other products offered by us. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. In addition, divestitures of businesses involve a number of risks, including significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships, and a decrease in revenues and earnings associated with the divested business. Furthermore, divestitures potentially involve significant post-closing separation activities, which could involve the expenditure of material financial resources and significant employee resources. Any divestiture may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the dilutive impact from the loss of revenue associated with the divestiture, as well as significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  In January 2024, the Company announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Associated Spring and Hänggi businesses, currently included within the MCS business unit. See Item 7 and Note 23 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosure related to this planned divestiture"
5,B,BARNES GROUP INC,2023-02-21,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
Our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by any of the following risks. Our business could also be affected by additional risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. The below risks should be read in conjunction with Part II - Item 7 - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."" RISKS RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC Our business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected, and could be materially adversely affected in the future, by the global COVID-19 pandemic and related economic disruptions. COVID-19 has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, caused inflationary pressure in the U.S. and elsewhere, and created significant volatility, uncertainty and disruption within global financial markets. COVID-19 has adversely affected, and continues to pose risks to, our business, including our operational and financial performance, and may adversely impact our stock price, our ability to access capital markets and our ability to fund liquidity needs. Moreover, it may have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A.There continues to be considerable uncertainty regarding the duration and extent to which COVID-19 will resurge in certain regions of the world; its severity; the emergence, contagiousness, and threat of new and different strains of the virus; disruptions or closures of our manufacturing operations or those of our customers and suppliers in certain regions due to government shutdowns and other restrictions or due to employee absenteeism and other staffing issues related to COVID-19; and disruptions in the supply chain, including those caused by industry capacity constraints and material availability. Although certain restrictions related to COVID-19 have eased, uncertainty continues to exist regarding such measures and potential future measures, and this uncertainty is expected to continue in 2023, and may significantly adversely affect our business and outlook. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESSES AND THE INDUSTRIES WITHIN WHICH WE OPERATE We depend on revenues and earnings from a small number of significant customers. Any bankruptcy of or loss of or cancellation, reduction or delay in purchases by these customers could harm our business. Net sales to GE and its subsidiaries in 2022 accounted for 20% of our total sales and approximately 57% of Aerospace's net sales. Approximately 15% of Aerospace's net sales in 2022 were to its next three largest customers. Approximately 10% of Industrial's sales in 2022 were to its five largest customers. Some of our success will depend on the business strength and viability of those customers. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our largest customers. Some of our customers may in the future reduce their purchases due to economic conditions or shift their purchases from us to our competitors, in-house or to other sources. Some of our long-term sales agreements provide that the customer may unilaterally reduce or discontinue its projected purchases without penalty or terminate for convenience. The loss of one or more of our largest customers, any reduction, cancellation or delay in sales to these customers (including a reduction in aftermarket volume in our Aerospace Aftermarket business' Revenue Sharing Programs), our inability to successfully develop relationships with new customers, or future price concessions we make to retain customers could significantly reduce our sales and profitability. We may not recover all of our up-front costs related to new or existing programs. New programs may require significant up-front investments for capital equipment, engineering, inventory, design and tooling. As OEMs in the transportation and aerospace industries have looked to suppliers to bear increasing responsibility for the design, engineering and manufacture of systems and components, they have increasingly shifted the financial risk associated with those responsibilities 5Table of Contents to the suppliers as well. This trend may continue and is most evident in the area of engineering cost reimbursement. We cannot assure you that we will have adequate funds to make such up-front investments or to recover such costs from our customers as part of our product pricing or through sales volume. In such event, our profitability, liquidity and cash flows may be adversely affected. In addition, we incur costs and make capital expenditures for new program awards based upon certain estimates of production volumes and production complexity. While we attempt to recover such costs and capital expenditures by appropriately pricing our products, the prices of our products are based in part upon planned production volumes. If the actual production is significantly less than planned or significantly more complex than anticipated, we may be unable to recover such costs. In addition, because a significant portion of our overall costs is fixed, declines in our customers’ production levels can adversely affect the level of our reported profits even if our up-front investments are recovered.We may not realize all of the sales expected from our existing backlog or anticipated orders. At December 31, 2022, we had $1,020.3 million of order backlog, the majority of which related to Aerospace OEM customers, as compared with $904.6 million at the end of 2021. Of the 2022 year-end backlog, $759.8 million was attributable to Aerospace and $260.5 million was attributable to Industrial. Approximately 60% of the Company's consolidated year-end backlog is expected to be recognized during 2023, with the remainder scheduled to be recognized after 2023. There can be no assurances that the revenues projected in our backlog will be realized or, if realized, will result in profits. We consider backlog to be firm customer orders for future delivery. OEM customers may provide projections of components and assemblies that they anticipate purchasing in the future under existing programs. These projections may represent orders that are beyond lead time and are included in backlog when supported by a long term agreement. Our customers may have the right under certain circumstances or with certain penalties or consequences to terminate, reduce or defer firm orders that we have in backlog. If this occurs, we may be protected from certain costs and losses, but our sales will nevertheless be adversely affected. Although we strive to maintain strong relationships with our customers, there is an ongoing risk that orders may be canceled or rescheduled due to fluctuations in our customers’ business requirements. Also, our realization of sales from new and existing programs is inherently subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties, including whether our customers execute the launch of programs on time, or at all, the number of units that our customers actually produce, the timing of production and manufacturing insourcing decisions made by our customers. In addition, until firm orders are placed, our customers may have the right to discontinue a program or replace us with another supplier at any time without penalty. Our failure to realize sales from new and existing programs could have a material adverse effect on our net sales, results of operations and cash flows. We face risks of cost overruns and losses on fixed-price contracts and orders in backlog. We sell certain of our products under firm, fixed-price contracts providing for a fixed price for the products regardless of the production or purchase costs incurred by us, which includes certain orders in backlog, some of which have long lead times. The cost of producing and delivering products may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, outside processing, freight, shipping, overhead and other factors, including manufacturing inefficiencies. Such increased costs may result in cost overruns and losses on contracts. Original equipment manufacturers in the aerospace and transportation industries have significant pricing leverage over suppliers and may be able to achieve price reductions over time. Additionally, we may not be successful in our efforts to raise prices on our customers. While many of our customers permit periodic adjustments to pricing based on changes in component prices and other factors, we may bear the risk of price increases that occur between any such repricing or, if such repricing is not permitted, during the balance of the term of the particular customer contract. There is substantial and continuing pressure from OEMs in the aerospace and transportation industries, including automotive, to reduce the prices they pay to suppliers. We attempt to manage such downward pricing pressure, while trying to preserve our business relationships with our customers, by seeking to reduce our production costs through various measures, including purchasing raw materials and components at lower prices and implementing cost-effective process improvements. Our suppliers have periodically resisted, and in the future may resist, pressure to lower their prices and may seek to impose price increases. If we are unable to offset OEM price reductions, our profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, OEMs have substantial leverage in setting purchasing and payment terms, including the terms of accelerated payment programs under which payments are made prior to the account due date in return for an early payment discount. OEMs can unexpectedly change their purchasing policies and/or payment practices, which could have a negative impact on our short-term working capital. We operate in highly competitive markets. Our future growth is dependent upon our ability to bring to market competitive, and increasingly complex, new products and services that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins. Our two global business segments compete with a number of larger and smaller companies in the markets we serve. Some of our competitors have greater financial, production, research and development, or other resources than we do. Within Aerospace, certain of our OEM customers compete with our repair and overhaul business, and some compete with us where they have the ability to manufacture the components and assemblies that we supply to them but have chosen, for capacity 6Table of Contents limitations, cost considerations or other reasons, to outsource the manufacturing to us. Our customers award business based on, among other things, price, quality, reliability of supply, service, technology and design. Our competitors’ efforts to grow market share could exert downward pressure on our product pricing and margins. Our competitors may also develop products or services, or methods of delivering those products or services, that are superior to ours. In addition, our competitors may adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with our existing or future competitors. The industries in which we operate have been experiencing consolidation, both in our suppliers and the customers we serve. Supplier consolidation is in part attributable to OEMs more frequently awarding long-term sole source or preferred supplier contracts to the most capable suppliers in an effort to reduce the total number of suppliers. If consolidation of our existing competitors or customers occurs, we would expect the competitive pressures we face to increase, and we cannot assure you that our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows will not be adversely impacted as a result.Our operations focus on highly engineered components which require extensive engineering and research and development time. Moreover, our ability to develop new products and services and to compete successfully will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to make investments of significant resources. These efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, may not lead to the development of new products or services on a timely basis, and may require us to reduce costs by such means as reducing excess capacity, improving productivity, eliminating redundancies and increasing production in low-cost countries. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, in optimizing our manufacturing footprint in low-cost countries. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or that we will be successful in maintaining our competitive position. If we are unable to differentiate our products and services or maintain a low-cost footprint, we may lose market share or be forced to reduce prices, thereby lowering our margins. Our competitive advantage may be adversely impacted if we cannot continue to introduce new products ahead of our competition, or if our products are rendered obsolete by other products or by new, different technologies and processes. The success of our new products will depend on a number of factors, including innovation, customer acceptance, the efficiency of our suppliers in providing materials and component parts, and the performance and quality of our products relative to those of our competitors. Additionally, we may face increased or unexpected costs associated with new product introduction, including the use of additional resources such as personnel and capital. We cannot provide assurance that we will not experience new product introduction delays in the future. As we introduce new products, we may be unable to detect and correct defects in product design. Even after introduction, new or enhanced products may not satisfy customer preferences and product failures may cause customers to reject our products. As a result, these products may not achieve market acceptance and our brand image could suffer. Any such occurrences could significantly reduce our revenues, increase our operating costs, or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The development of new products and services presents security risks. An increasing number of our products and services are delivered with digital capabilities and the accompanying interconnected device networks, some of which include sensors, data, and advanced computing capabilities. If we are unable to manage the lifecycle cybersecurity risk in development, deployment and operation of our digital platforms and services, the possible consequences include financial loss, reputational damage, exposure to legal claims or enforcement actions, theft of intellectual property, the diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.A significant portion of the sales of certain businesses within our Industrial segment are realized from the design, manufacture, distribution and service of highly-engineered and customized products and systems for plastic injection molding and plastics processing across a broad spectrum of applications. Sales volume is dependent upon the need for equipment used to produce plastic products, which may be significantly influenced by the demand for plastic products, the capital investment needs of companies in the plastic injection molding and plastics processing industries, changes in technological advances, and changes in laws or regulations such as those related to single-use plastics, product and packaging composition, and recycling. Decrease in demand for plastic products or equipment used in the production of plastic products or unfavorable developments in these industries generally could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Demand for our defense-related products depends on government spending. A portion of Aerospace's sales is derived from defense markets, including single-sourced and dual-sourced sales. The defense market is largely dependent upon government budgets and is subject to governmental appropriations. Although multi-year contracts may be authorized in connection with major procurements, funds are generally appropriated on a fiscal year basis even though a program may be expected to continue for several years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded and additional funds are committed only as further appropriations are made. We cannot assure you that maintenance of or increases in defense spending 7Table of Contents will be allocated to programs that would benefit our business. Moreover, we cannot assure you that new defense-related aircraft programs in which we participate will enter full-scale production as expected. A decrease in levels of defense spending or the government’s termination of, or failure to fully fund, one or more of the contracts for the programs in which we participate could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.The aerospace industry is highly regulated. Complications related to aerospace regulations may adversely affect the Company. A substantial portion of our income is derived from our aerospace businesses. The aerospace industry is highly regulated in the U.S. by the Federal Aviation Administration and in other countries by similar regulatory agencies. We must be certified by these agencies and, in some cases, by individual OEMs in order to engineer, produce and service systems and components used in specific aircraft models. If material authorizations or approvals were delayed, suspended or revoked, our business could be adversely affected. In the future, new or more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted or industry oversight heightened, and we may incur significant expenses to comply with any such new regulations or heightened industry oversight. Fluctuations in the price of jet fuel, resins, energy and other raw materials and their availability may impact our operating results. Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of operating expenses for companies in the aerospace industry. Fluctuations in fuel costs could impact levels and frequency of aircraft maintenance and overhaul activities, and airlines' decisions on maintaining, deferring or canceling new aircraft purchases, in part based on the value associated with new fuel efficient technologies. Increases in fuel prices can also increase our packaging and transportation costs. Both we and our customers purchase supplies of resins, which are oil-based components used in the manufacture of certain products, and any significant increases in resin costs could adversely impact future operating results, including as a result of customers' decisions on maintaining, deferring or canceling new programs. Weather-related events, natural disasters, political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, changes in governmental policy concerning aircraft fuel production, changes in refining capacity, and other unpredictable events may result in future fuel supply shortages and fuel price increases. For example, widespread disruption to oil production, refinery operations and pipeline capacity in certain areas of the U.S. can impact the price of jet fuel significantly. Geopolitical conflicts, such as conflicts in the Middle East, an important source of oil for the U.S. and other countries where we do business, and the Russia-Ukraine war, cause prices for fuel and energy to be volatile and availability to be impacted. In addition, new laws or regulations adopted in response to climate change could increase energy and transportation costs, as well as the costs of certain raw materials and components. In recent years, the costs of certain raw materials, transportation and energy necessary for our operations and the production and distribution of our products have increased significantly. While we have implemented cost containment measures and selective price increases, as well as taken other actions to offset these inflationary pressures in our supply chain, we may not be able to completely offset all the increases in our operational costs, and there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING A GLOBAL BUSINESS AND REGULATORY RISKSOur operations depend on our global manufacturing, sales and service facilities and information systems which are subject to physical, environmental, operational and other risks that could disrupt our operations. We have a significant number of manufacturing facilities, technical service centers, and sales and distribution centers both within and outside the U.S. The global scope of our business subjects us to increased risks and uncertainties such as threats of war, terrorism and instability of governments, and economic, regulatory and legal systems in countries in which we or our customers conduct business. In addition, our customers' and suppliers' facilities, as well as our own facilities, are located in areas that may be affected by natural disasters, including earthquakes, windstorms, droughts and floods, or by limited accessibility to sufficient water resources, which could cause significant physical damage and disruption to our equipment and facilities, as well as the infrastructure of our customers and suppliers, and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, some of our manufacturing equipment and tooling is custom-made and is not readily replaceable. Loss of such equipment or tooling could have a negative impact on our manufacturing capabilities and, as a result, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. A major catastrophe such as an earthquake, windstorm, drought, flood or other natural disaster, infectious disease outbreak, significant labor strikes, work stoppages, or political unrest, in any of the areas where we or our customers or key suppliers conduct operations could result in a prolonged interruption of our business. Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in the manufacture or shipment of products or the provision of repair and other services that may result in our loss of sales and customers. Although we have obtained property damage and business interruption insurance, our insurance will not cover all potential risks, and we cannot assure you that we will have adequate insurance to compensate us for all losses that result from any insured risks. Any material loss not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We cannot assure you that insurance will be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us or at a cost that will not have a material adverse effect on our profitability, net income and cash flows.8Table of Contents The global nature of our operations subjects us to financial and regulatory risks in the countries in which we and our customers, suppliers and other business partners operate. In addition, we sell or may in the future sell our products and services to the U.S. and foreign governments and in foreign countries. As a global business, we are subject to complex laws, regulations and other conditions in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate, and associated risks, including: U.S.-imposed embargoes of sales to specific countries; foreign import controls; import regulations and duties; export regulations (which require us to comply with stringent licensing regimes); reporting requirements regarding the use of ""conflict"" minerals mined from certain countries; anti-dumping regulations; unclaimed property laws; price and currency controls; dividend remittance restrictions; expropriation of assets; war, civil uprisings and riots; government instability; government-imposed economic uncertainties, such as a prolonged U.S. federal government shutdown; government contracting requirements including cost accounting standards and various procurement, security and audit requirements, as well as requirements to certify to the government compliance with these requirements; the necessity of obtaining governmental approval for new and continuing products and operations; and legal systems or decrees, laws, taxes, regulations, interpretations and court decisions that are not always fully developed and that may be retroactively or arbitrarily applied. In the past, we have experienced inadvertent violations of some of these regulations, including export regulations and regulations prohibiting sales of certain products, none of which has had or, we believe, will have a material adverse effect on our business. Any significant violations of these or other regulations in the future could result in civil or criminal sanctions, suspension of production, loss of export or other licenses, other restrictions on our operations or damage to our reputation. We may also be subject to unanticipated income taxes, excise and custom duties, import taxes, export taxes, value added taxes, or other governmental assessments, and taxes may be impacted by changes in legislation in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, our organizational and capital structure may limit our ability to transfer funds between countries without incurring adverse tax consequences. Any of these events could result in a loss of business or other unexpected costs that could reduce sales or profits and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are subject to environmental laws and regulations and the risk of environmental liabilities, violations and litigation. We are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the health and safety of our employees, the generation, storage, use, transportation and disposal of certain materials including hazardous materials, emissions or discharges of substances into the environment, and investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites. Our operations involve the use, primarily in our manufacturing processes, of substances subject to these laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities; suspension of production; alteration of our manufacturing; damage to our reputation; and restrictions on our operations or sales. Furthermore, environmental laws outside of the U.S. are becoming more stringent, resulting in increased costs and compliance burdens. In addition, certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at their properties or at properties from or upon which they have disposed of hazardous substances. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims based on alleged presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances. The ultimate cost of site cleanup and timing of future cash outflows is difficult to predict, given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods.The costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations, or liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances, may exceed our estimates, or have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.Climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change, may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations. Climate change resulting from increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could present risks to our future operations from natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, wildfires, droughts or flooding. Such extreme weather conditions could pose physical risks to our facilities and disrupt operation of our supply chain and may impact operational costs. The impacts of climate change on global water resources may result in water scarcity, which could in the future impact our ability to access sufficient quantities of water in certain locations and result in increased costs. Concern over climate change will likely result in new legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change. Further, our customers and the markets we serve may impose emissions reduction or other environmental standards and requirements, including plastic injection molding and plastics processing and conventional fuel-based automotive markets. As a result, we may experience increased compliance burdens and operational costs and raw material sourcing, manufacturing operations and the distribution of our products may be adversely affected. Moreover, we may not be able to timely meet these requirements due to the required level of capital investment or technological advancement. While we have been committed to continuous improvements to meet anticipated regulations and 9Table of Contents preferences, there can be no assurance that our commitments will be successful, that our products will be accepted by the market, that proposed regulations will not have a negative competitive impact or that economic returns will reflect our investments in new product development. There also continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. These factors may impact the demand for, or obsolescence of, certain of our products, and adversely affect our results of operations.We are committed to reducing our carbon emissions, water consumption and waste generation, which may require us to expend significant resources that could increase our operational costs. Further, there can be no assurance of the extent to which any of our commitments will be achieved, or that any future investments we make in furtherance of achieving such targets and goals will meet investor expectations or any binding or non-binding legal standards regarding sustainability performance. Moreover, we may determine that it is in the best interest of our Company and our stockholders to prioritize other business, social, governance or sustainability investments over the achievement of our current commitments based on economic, regulatory and social factors, business strategy or pressure from investors, activist groups or other stakeholders. If we are unable to meet these commitments, then we could incur adverse publicity and reaction from investors, activist groups or other stakeholders, which could adversely impact the perception of us and our products and services by current and potential customers, as well as investors, which could in turn adversely impact our results of operations.We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA"") and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws and data privacy and security laws. The FCPA and similar anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining an unfair advantage. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Our operations outside the United States, including in developing countries, expose us to the risk of such violations. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. Despite our training and compliance program, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations, or allegations, could damage our reputation, as well as result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties, termination of relationships with business partners and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions, and as a result might materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Additionally, to conduct our operations, we regularly move data across borders, and consequently we are subject to a variety of increasingly complex and changing laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, use, transmission and protection of personal information and other customer, vendor or employee data. The interpretation and enforcement of such laws and regulations, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, continue to develop and there is significant uncertainty with respect to how compliance with these laws and regulations may evolve and the costs and complexity of future compliance. Violations could result in substantial fines, sanctions or civil penalties, and damage to our reputation and might materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.International trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position. Our results could be impacted by changes in tariffs, trade agreements, sanctions or other trade restrictions imposed or agreed to by the U.S. or foreign governments. For example, a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or imposition of trade regulations in response to war or other global crises could have a negative impact on our results of operations due to their impact on commodity pricing and supply chains. Trade restrictions, including withdrawal from or modification of existing trade agreements, negotiation of new trade agreements, and imposition of new (and retaliatory) tariffs against certain countries or covering certain products has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, customers, suppliers and/or the U.S. or foreign economies or certain sectors thereof in which we compete, and impair our ability to expand our business by offering new technologies, products and services. It remains unclear what the U.S. federal government or foreign governments will or will not do in the future with respect to tariffs or other international trade agreements and policies. Trade restrictions, and changes in or uncertainty surrounding global trade policies, may adversely impact our competitive position, businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The global nature of our business exposes us to foreign currency fluctuations that may affect our future revenues, debt levels and profitability. As noted above, we have manufacturing facilities and technical service centers, and sales and distribution centers around the world, and the majority of our foreign operations use the local currency as their functional currency. These include, among others, the Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, Czech koruna, Euro, Japanese yen, Korean won, Malaysian ringgit, Mexican peso, Singaporean dollar, Swedish krona, and the Swiss franc. Since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies expose us to translation risk when the local currency financial statements are translated to U.S. dollars. Changes in currency exchange rates may also expose us to transaction risk. We may buy hedges in certain currencies to 10Table of Contents reduce or offset our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations; however, these transactions may not be adequate or effective to protect us against unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations. We have not engaged in any speculative hedging activities. Currency fluctuations may adversely impact our revenues and profitability in the future. RISKS RELATED TO SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURINGThe ability of suppliers to deliver raw materials, parts and components and energy resources, and our ability to manufacture without disruption, could affect our results of operations. We use a wide range of materials (including steel, stainless steel, titanium, aluminum, Inconel, Hastelloys and other specialty materials) and components (including semiconductors and other electronic components) in the global production of our products, which come from numerous suppliers around the world. Our operations and those of our suppliers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including COVID-19 related supplier plant shutdowns or slowdowns, transportation delays, work stoppages, labor shortages, price inflation, financial issues such as supplier bankruptcy, information technology failures, and hazards such as fire, earthquakes, flooding, droughts or other natural disasters, new laws or regulations, global economic or political events including terrorist attacks and war, and suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers. Because not all of our business arrangements provide for guaranteed supply, and some key raw materials, parts and components and energy resources may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers, we are subject to supply and pricing risk. For example, we expect to continue to be impacted by supply chain issues due to economic, political and other factors largely beyond our control, increased material costs and component shortages, supply chain disruptions and delays, and cost inflation, all of which could continue or escalate in the future. The effects of climate change, including extreme weather events, long-term changes in temperature levels, water availability, supply costs impacted by increasing energy costs, or energy costs impacted by carbon prices or offsets may exacerbate these risks. Such disruptions could interrupt our ability to manufacture certain products and result in increased pricing, and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Any product liability, warranty, contractual or other claims may harm our business or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. We are exposed to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of our products and the products we buy from third parties and sell to our customers, and to potential warranty, contractual or other claims. Our products are complex and may contain defects, errors, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance, due to any number of issues, including issues in materials, design, fabrication, packaging and/or use within a system or item of equipment. Further, because of the complexity of our products, defects or errors might only be detected when the products are in use. Development of new products increases complexity and adds risk to manufacturing reliability, and increases the likelihood of product defects or errors. Risks associated with product defects are exacerbated by the fact that our customers typically integrate our products into other equipment and systems. Our products may be responsible for critical functions in our customers’ products. Failure of our products to perform to specifications, or other product defects, could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell to our customers, the equipment and/or systems into which our products are integrated and to the end users of such equipment/and or systems. Such defects could give rise to warranty claims or claims under indemnification clauses in our agreements, which may range from individual customer claims to full recalls of all products in the field, and result in significant costs, including costs related to developing solutions, recalling products, inspecting, repairing or replacing defective products, or writing down defective inventory, and could result in the loss of sales and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts. In addition, defects in our products could result in failure to achieve market acceptance, a loss of participation in customer programs, a shifting of business to our competitors, and litigation or regulatory action against us, and could harm our reputation, our relationships with customers and our ability to attract new customers, as well as the perceptions of our brands. Other potential adverse impacts of product defects include shipment delays, write-offs of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, and losses on unfavorable purchase commitments. Moreover, the occurrence of defects may give rise to product liability claims, particularly if defects in our products or the products into which they are integrated result in personal injury or death, and could result in significant costs, expenses and losses. For example, we may be exposed to potential liability for personal injury, property damage or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft or automotive component designed, manufactured or sold by us, or the failure of an aircraft or automotive component that has been serviced by us or of the components themselves. If a product liability claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant, and could divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business, even if we are successful. We may be named in product liability claims even if there is no evidence that our products caused the damage in question, and even though we may have indemnity from our customers, and such claims could result in significant costs and expenses. We vigorously defend ourselves in connection with these matters. We cannot, however, assure you that the costs, charges and liabilities associated with these matters will not be material, or that those costs, charges and liabilities will not exceed any amounts reserved for them in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Further, while we have liability insurance for certain 11Table of Contents risks, our insurance may not cover all liabilities, including potential reputational impacts. Additionally, insurance coverage may not be available in the future on acceptable terms or at a cost acceptable to us. The above is exacerbated by the fact that our products may be used, and perform critical functions, in various high-risk applications such as aerospace, automobiles, and robotics, among others. Accordingly, defects in our products could have an adverse impact on us, on our customers and the end users of our customers’ products. If any of these risks materialize, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.RISKS RELATED TO HUMAN CAPITALOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract, develop, engage and retain qualified employees. Our executive officers and key management personnel are critical to driving business performance and successfully executing the Company’s growth strategy. Because of the complex nature of many of our products and services, and our focus on technological and product innovations, we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilled workforce, including our engineering talent and our sales professionals. We manage human capital through our Talent Management System, which is aimed at enhancing our ability to attract and hire talented employees, as well as supporting their growth, development and engagement; however, we cannot guarantee the system's effectiveness. Failure to attract, develop, engage and retain qualified employees, whether as a result of an insufficient number of qualified applicants, difficulty in recruiting new employees, or inadequate resources to train, integrate and retain qualified employees, could impair our ability to execute our business strategy, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, while we aim to reduce the impact of the departure of employees, our operations or ability to execute our business strategy may be impacted by the loss of employees, particularly when departures involve groups of employees, such as restructuring and workforce reduction actions. Such losses may adversely affect the Company through decreased employee morale, the loss of knowledge of departing employees, and the devotion of resources to reorganizing and reassigning job roles and responsibilities, and could increase the risk of claims or litigation from former employees.Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted by strikes or work stoppages. We employ approximately 5,200 people worldwide. Approximately 35% of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, trade union agreements and/or national industry agreements. Although we believe that our relations with our employees and labor unions that represent our employees are good, and we have experienced no material strikes or work stoppages recently, we cannot assure you that we will not experience in the future these and other types of conflicts with labor unions, works councils, other groups representing employees or our employees generally, nor that any future negotiations with our labor unions will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor, including healthcare, pensions or other benefits. Any potential strikes or work stoppages, and the resulting adverse impact on our relationships with customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Similarly, a protracted strike or work stoppage at any of our major customers, suppliers or other vendors could materially adversely affect our business.RISKS RELATED TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, CYBERSECURITY AND DATA PRIVACYAny disruption or failure in the operation of our information systems, including from conversions or integrations of information technology (“IT”) or reporting systems, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our IT systems are an integral part of our business. We depend on our IT systems to help communicate internally and externally, and to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities, such as processing orders, managing inventory, making payments, collecting accounts receivable, and storing information. In addition, our IT systems allow us to purchase, sell and ship products timely and efficiently, to maintain cost-effective operations, and to provide superior service to our customers. Moreover, we use IT systems to record, process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. We periodically implement, upgrade and integrate IT systems, such as our enterprise resource planning (""ERP"") and customer relationship management (“CRM”) platforms across our businesses. If we experience a problem with the functioning of an important IT system as a result of the increased burden placed on our IT infrastructure or a security breach or a service issue experienced by an external third party vendor that stores or processes our data, including during system upgrades and/or new system implementations, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business or operating results.Increased cybersecurity requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted IT-related crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, data and services and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In the ordinary course of our business, we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business 12Table of Contents partners, and personally identifiable information in our data centers and on our networks. In addition to utilizing non-cloud environments, we also leverage cloud-based systems, where data is stored and exchanged with external third party vendors. The secure maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our business operations. Despite our security measures, our IT systems and infrastructure, including vendor-hosted systems, may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. These cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to IT systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company, its products, its customers and/or its third-party service providers, including cloud providers. These threats and incidents originate from many sources globally and include malwares that take the form of computer viruses, ransomware, worms, Trojan horses, spyware, adware, scareware, rogue software, and other programs that act against the computer user. Our customers are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections, and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands. While we deploy measures to deter, prevent, detect, respond to and mitigate these threats, including identity and access controls and vulnerability assessments, despite these efforts, cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could compromise our networks and the information stored there, including critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties), could be accessed, altered, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Such incidents could remain undetected for an extended period of time, and the losses arising from such incidents could exceed our available insurance coverage for such matters. Such incidents could also disrupt our operations, impacting manufacturing production and transactional processing, and result in increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, theft of intellectual property, and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position. Further, cybersecurity and data protection laws and regulations continue to evolve in the U.S. and worldwide. This adds compliance complexity and may increase our costs of compliance and expose us to litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions or fines in one or more jurisdictions. In addition, as security threats continue to evolve and increase in frequency and sophistication, it will likely require investing in additional resources to protect the security of our IT systems.RISKS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights. Our intellectual property rights may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage, and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. As patents expire, we could face increased competition, which could negatively impact our operating results. Infringement of our intellectual property and other proprietary rights by a third party, or copying of our technology in countries where we do not hold patents, could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities. We cannot be certain that the measures we have implemented will prevent our intellectual property from being improperly disclosed, challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. For example, competitors may avoid infringement liability by developing non-infringing competing technologies or by effectively concealing infringement. We may need to spend significant resources monitoring and enforcing our intellectual property rights and we may not be aware of or able to detect or prove infringement by third parties. Our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the protection and enforceability of those rights in some countries. If we seek to enforce our intellectual property rights, we may be subject to claims that those rights are invalid or unenforceable, and others may seek counterclaims against us, which could have a negative impact on our business. In addition, changes in intellectual property laws or their interpretation may impact our ability to protect and assert our intellectual property rights, increase costs and uncertainties in the prosecution of patent applications and enforcement or defense of issued patents, and diminish the value of our intellectual property. If we do not protect and enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, or if they are circumvented, invalidated, or rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, it could have an adverse impact on our competitive position and our operating results. Our employees, consultants and other parties are subject to confidentiality obligations, but this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation, theft, misuse, disclosure, loss or destruction of our proprietary information and/or infringement of our intellectual property. For example, employees and former employees, in particular former employees who become employees of our competitors, may misappropriate, use, publish or provide to our competitors, customers or other third parties our intellectual property, advantageous know-how or other proprietary information. Similarly, we provide access to certain of our intellectual property and other proprietary information to our direct and indirect customers and certain of our consultants who may wrongfully use or disclose such intellectual property or information. Any of these events could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, cause us to lose business, damage our reputation, subject us to legal or regulatory proceedings, cause us to incur other loss or liability and otherwise adversely affect our business. Third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. Regardless of the merit of such claims, any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly 13Table of Contents and time-consuming to defend and resolve due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation, and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. A claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement, which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all, require us to redesign our products, which would be costly and time-consuming, or subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against the development and sale of certain of our products or services. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement. In addition, we may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets and other confidential business information. Any such incidents and claims could severely harm our business and reputation, result in significant expenses, harm our competitive position, and prevent us from selling certain products and services, all of which could have a significant adverse impact on our business and results of operations. RISKS RELATED TO LIQUIDITY AND OTHER RISKS We have significant indebtedness that could affect our operations and financial condition, and our failure to meet certain financial covenants required by our debt agreements may materially and adversely affect our assets, financial position and cash flows. At December 31, 2022, we had consolidated debt obligations of $571.1 million, representing approximately 30% of our total capital (indebtedness plus stockholders’ equity) as of that date. Our level of indebtedness, proportion of variable rate debt obligations and the significant debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness may adversely affect our operations and financial condition. For example, our indebtedness could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, investments in technology and research and development, acquisitions, dividends and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industries in which we compete; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors, some of whom have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources than we do; limit our ability to borrow additional funds; or increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. In addition, a majority of our debt arrangements require us to maintain certain debt and interest coverage ratios and limit our ability to incur debt, make investments or undertake certain other business activities. These requirements could limit our ability to obtain future financing and may prevent us from taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. Our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our debt arrangements may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the restrictions could result in an event of default under our debt arrangements which, in turn, could result in an event of default under the terms of our other indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our debt arrangements, after the expiration of any grace periods, our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our debt arrangements, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to happen, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the payments due under those arrangements or our other indebtedness or that we could find alternative financing to replace that indebtedness. Conditions in the worldwide credit markets may limit our ability to expand our credit lines beyond current bank commitments. In addition, our profitability may be adversely affected as a result of increases in interest rates. At December 31, 2022, we and our subsidiaries had $571.1 million aggregate principal amount of consolidated debt obligations outstanding, of which approximately 64% had interest rates that float with the market (not hedged against interest rate fluctuations). A 100 basis point increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in effect at December 31, 2022 would result in an approximate $3.7 million annualized increase in interest expense. We have significant goodwill and an impairment of our goodwill could cause a decline in our net worth. Our total assets include substantial goodwill. At December 31, 2022, our goodwill totaled $835.5 million. The goodwill results from our prior acquisitions, representing the excess of the purchase price we paid over the net assets of the companies acquired. We assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill during each calendar year or more frequently if an event or change in circumstances indicates that the fair value of a reporting unit has been reduced below its carrying value. If future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units does not meet expectations or fair values fall due to significant stock market declines, we may be required to reflect an incremental non-cash charge to operating results for goodwill impairment. During the three-month period ended June 30, 2022, management recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $68.2 million related to the Automation reporting unit as the estimated fair value of the reporting unit declined below its carrying value. See Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company has continued to evaluate macro-economic conditions through December 31, 2022. Based on our subsequent assessments, there was no additional impairment of goodwill as of December 31, 2022. In the event there are future adverse changes in our estimated future cash flows and/or changes in key assumptions, including but not limited to discount rates, revenue growth or margins, and/or terminal growth rates, we may be required to record additional non-cash impairment charges to Automation goodwill. The recognition of an additional impairment of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect our results of 14Table of Contents operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material. See “Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies.” We may not realize all of the intangible assets related to the Aerospace Aftermarket businesses. We participate in aftermarket RSPs under which we receive an exclusive right to supply designated aftermarket parts over the life of the related aircraft engine program to our customer, GE. As consideration, we pay participation fees, which are recorded as intangible assets and are recognized as a reduction of sales over the estimated life of the related engine programs. Our total investments in participation fees under our RSPs as of December 31, 2022 equaled $299.5 million, all of which have been paid. At December 31, 2022, the remaining unamortized balance of these participation fees was $135.3 million. We entered into CRPs, also with GE, which provide for, among other items, the right to sell certain aftermarket component repair services for CFM56, CF6, CF34 and LM engines directly to other customers over the life of the engine program as one of a few GE licensed suppliers. In addition, the CRPs extended certain contracts under which the Company currently provides these services directly to GE. Our total investments in CRPs as of December 31, 2022 equaled $111.8 million, all of which have been paid. At December 31, 2022, the remaining unamortized balance of the CRPs was $70.0 million. We recorded the CRP payments as intangible assets which are recognized as a reduction of sales over the remaining useful life of these engine programs.The realizability of each asset is dependent upon future revenues related to the programs' aftermarket parts and services and is subject to impairment testing if circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. The potential exists that actual revenues will not meet expectations due to a change in market conditions, including, for example, the replacement of older engines with new, more fuel-efficient engines or our ability to maintain market share within the aftermarket business. A shortfall in future revenues may result in the failure to realize the net amount of the investments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, profitability could be impacted by the amortization of the participation fees and licenses, and the expiration of the international tax incentives on these programs. See “Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies.” We carry significant inventories and a loss in net realizable value could cause a decline in our net worth. At December 31, 2022, our inventories totaled $283.4 million. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value based on management's judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels, quantities and prices at which such inventories will be sold in the normal course of business. Accelerating the disposal process or changes in estimates of future sales potential may necessitate future reduction to inventory values. See “Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies.” We maintain pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the U.S. and certain international locations. Our costs of providing defined benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on the plans’ assets, interest rates, exchange rate fluctuations, future governmental regulation, global fixed income and equity prices, and our required and/or voluntary contributions to the plans. Declines in the stock market, prevailing interest rates, declines in discount rates, improvements in mortality rates and rising medical costs may cause an increase in our pension and other postretirement benefit expenses in the future and result in reductions in our pension fund asset values and increases in our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. These changes have caused and may continue to cause a significant reduction in our net worth and without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans’ assets, and depending upon the other factors listed above, we could be required to increase funding for some or all of these pension and postretirement plans. Changes in taxation requirements could affect our financial results. Our products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions in which we operate. Increases in indirect taxes could affect our products’ affordability and therefore reduce our sales. We are also subject to income tax in numerous jurisdictions in which we generate revenues. Changes in tax laws, tax rates or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. Among other things, our tax liabilities are affected by the mix of pretax income or loss among the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and the potential repatriation of foreign earnings to the U.S. Further, during the ordinary course of business, we are subject to examination by the various tax authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate which could result in an unanticipated increase in taxes. Any potential changes or interpretive guidance may impact current and deferred income tax expense and deferred tax balances for U.S operations as well as the potential future repatriation of foreign income. The impact of any proposed changes in tax regulations may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Changes in accounting guidance could affect our financial results. New accounting guidance that may become applicable to us from time to time, or changes in the interpretations of existing guidance, could have a significant effect on our 15Table of Contents reported results for the affected periods. Adoption of new accounting guidance could have a material impact on our financial statements and may retroactively affect the accounting treatment of transactions completed before adoption. See Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.Actions of activist stockholders could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management’s attention and resources, and have an adverse effect on our business. From time to time, we may be subject to proposals by stockholders urging us to take certain corporate actions. Activist stockholder activity could have an adverse effect on our business as responding to proxy contests and reacting to other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees. For example, we may be required to retain the services of various professionals to advise us on activist stockholder matters, including legal, financial, and communications advisers, the costs of which may negatively impact our future financial results. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy or leadership created as a consequence of activist stockholder initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, harm our ability to attract new investors, customers, and employees, and cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation. RISKS RELATED TO STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS Our restructuring and integration actions could have long-term adverse effects on our business. As we implement restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, we may not achieve expected cost savings from workforce reductions or restructuring activities and actual charges, costs and adjustments due to these actions may vary materially from our estimates. In addition, our consolidation and integration activities may not provide the expected benefits. Our ability to realize anticipated cost savings, synergies and revenue enhancements may be affected by a number of factors, including the following: our ability to effectively eliminate duplicative back office overhead and overlapping personnel, rationalize manufacturing capacity, synchronize IT systems, consolidate warehousing and other facilities and shift production to more economical facilities; significant cash and non-cash integration and implementation costs or charges in order to achieve those cost savings, which could offset any such savings; and our ability to avoid labor disruption in connection with these activities. In addition, delays in implementing planned restructuring, consolidation or integration activities or other productivity improvements may diminish the expected operational or financial benefits. Our acquisition and other strategic initiatives, some of which may be outside the industries in which we currently operate, may not be successful. We have made a number of acquisitions in the past, and we anticipate that we may, from time to time, acquire additional businesses, assets or securities of companies, and enter into joint ventures and other strategic relationships that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our businesses. These activities expose the Company to a number of risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of any of which could materially adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. A portion of the industries that we serve are mature industries. As a result, our future growth may depend in part on the successful acquisition and integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations. On the other hand, if we acquire a company that operates in an industry that is different from the ones in which we currently operate, our lack of experience with that company's industry could have a material adverse impact on our ability to manage that business and realize the benefits of that acquisition. We may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions, obtain financing on satisfactory terms, negotiate reasonable terms, properly perform due diligence and determine all the significant risks associated with a particular acquisition, avoid diversion of our management's attention from other important business activities, or obtain regulatory approvals or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future. We could have difficulties integrating acquired businesses with our existing operations, including coordinating and consolidating separate systems, retaining market acceptance of acquired products and services, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees, and implementing our enterprise resource planning systems and operational procedures and disciplines. Any such difficulties may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with employees, customers, business partners and suppliers. In addition, even if integration is successful, the financial performance of acquired businesses may not be as expected and there can be no assurance that we will realize anticipated benefits from our acquisitions. We cannot assure you that we will effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business or product offerings or realize anticipated operational synergies. These activities may result in difficulties, significant expense and accounting charges, disrupt our business or divert management’s time and attention.Acquisitions involve numerous other risks, including potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business. Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired businesses require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the business operations before we acquired it. However, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us 16Table of Contents fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial condition. In connection with acquisitions or joint venture investments outside the U.S., we may enter into derivative contracts to purchase foreign currency in order to hedge against the risk of foreign currency fluctuations in connection with such acquisitions or joint venture investments, which subjects us to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations associated with such derivative contracts. Additionally, our final determinations and appraisals of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions may vary materially from earlier estimates. We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment, and we cannot be certain that our business, operating results and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected. A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to any purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to retain, reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business, and collect the proceeds from any divestitures. In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other products offered by us. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. In addition, divestitures of businesses involve a number of risks, including significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships, and a decrease in revenues and earnings associated with the divested business. Furthermore, divestitures potentially involve significant post-closing separation activities, which could involve the expenditure of material financial resources and significant employee resources. Any divestiture may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the dilutive impact from the loss of revenue associated with the divestiture, as well as significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition"
0,B,BARNES GROUP INC,2022-02-22,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
Our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by any of the following risks. Our business could also be affected by additional risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. The below risks should be read in conjunction with Part II - Item 7 - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."" RISKS RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMICOur business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected, and could be materially adversely affected in the future, by the global COVID-19 pandemic and related economic disruptions. COVID-19 has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, caused inflationary pressure in the U.S. and elsewhere, and created significant volatility, uncertainty and disruption within global financial markets. COVID-19 has adversely affected, and continues to pose risks to, our business, including our operational and financial performance, and may adversely impact our stock price, our ability to access capital markets and our ability to fund liquidity needs. Moreover, it may have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A.There is considerable uncertainty regarding the duration and extent to which COVID-19 will continue to spread in certain regions of the world; its severity; the emergence, contagiousness, and threat of new and different strains of the virus; the impact of measures to try to contain the virus, both within and outside the U.S., such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, vaccine and testing mandates, government shutdowns and other restrictions; disruptions or closures of our manufacturing operations or those of our customers and suppliers; the success of these measures; disruptions in the supply chain, including those caused by industry capacity constraints, material availability, and global logistics delays and constraints arising from, among other things, transportation capacity of ocean shipping containers; and an increasingly competitive labor market due to a sustained labor shortage or increased turnover. Efforts to combat the virus have been complicated by viral 5Table of Contents variants and uneven access to, and acceptance and effectiveness of, vaccines globally. Although certain restrictions related to COVID-19 have eased, uncertainty continues to exist regarding such measures and potential future measures, and this uncertainty is expected to continue in 2022, and may significantly adversely affect our business and outlook.We have incurred and expect to continue to incur increased operating expenses in order to protect our employees, including for personal protective equipment and medical/safety supplies, additional cleaning supplies and services, testing supplies, and vaccination and testing status tracking tools. Uncertainties also remain with regard to the impact of COVID-19 on our customers and customer demand for our products and services, customer restrictions on our ability to visit their sites or otherwise access their employees, and the ability of our customers to pay for our products and services. For example, customers may decelerate decision making, delay planned work or seek to terminate existing agreements. Additional uncertainties include our ability to sell and provide our products and services due to transportation challenges and increased logistics costs; adherence to applicable travel restrictions and “shelter in place” orders; challenges and additional operating costs associated with continued remote working arrangements; adherence to social distancing guidelines; employee absenteeism, including employees who perform critical functions, due to illness, quarantine as a result of exposure or failure to comply with vaccine or testing mandates and policies; increased privacy-related risks due to processing health-related personal information; and legal claims related to personal protective equipment furnished by the Company or alleged exposure to COVID-19 on our premises or as a result of our employees at customer sites. COVID-19 has had and continues to have a material impact on air travel and the aviation industry. Several countries, including the United States, have taken steps to restrict air travel, and many companies have from time to time adopted policies prohibiting or curtailing non-essential business travel by their employees. Even in the absence of formal restrictions and prohibitions, infections and fear of contagion have adversely affected travel behavior which may continue. Moreover, airlines have, and may continue to have COVID-related staffing shortages resulting in flight cancellations and reduced numbers of flights. The foregoing has reduced demand for commercial aircraft. If COVID-19 continues to have a material impact on the airline and aviation industry, including on GE and our other large customers, it could continue to materially affect the business and results of operations of our Aerospace business. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESSES AND THE INDUSTRIES WITHIN WHICH WE OPERATE We depend on revenues and earnings from a small number of significant customers. Any bankruptcy of or loss of or cancellation, reduction or delay in purchases by these customers could harm our business. Net sales to GE and its subsidiaries in 2021 accounted for 16% of our total sales and approximately 55% of Aerospace's net sales. Aerospace's second and third largest customers, Rolls-Royce and Raytheon Technologies Corporation and their respective subsidiaries, accounted for 10% and 7%, respectively, of Aerospace's net sales in 2021. Approximately 9% of Aerospace's net sales in 2021 were to its next three largest customers. Approximately 10% of Industrial's sales in 2021 were to its five largest customers. Some of our success will depend on the business strength and viability of those customers. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our largest customers. Some of our customers may in the future reduce their purchases due to economic conditions or shift their purchases from us to our competitors, in-house or to other sources. Some of our long-term sales agreements provide that the customer may unilaterally reduce or discontinue its projected purchases without penalty or terminate for convenience. The loss of one or more of our largest customers, any reduction, cancellation or delay in sales to these customers (including a reduction in aftermarket volume in our Aerospace Aftermarket business' Revenue Sharing Programs), our inability to successfully develop relationships with new customers, or future price concessions we make to retain customers could significantly reduce our sales and profitability. We may not recover all of our up-front costs related to new or existing programs. New programs may require significant up-front investments for capital equipment, engineering, inventory, design and tooling. As OEMs in the transportation and aerospace industries have looked to suppliers to bear increasing responsibility for the design, engineering and manufacture of systems and components, they have increasingly shifted the financial risk associated with those responsibilities to the suppliers as well. This trend may continue and is most evident in the area of engineering cost reimbursement. We cannot assure you that we will have adequate funds to make such up-front investments or to recover such costs from our customers as part of our product pricing or through sales volume. In such event, our profitability, liquidity and cash flows may be adversely affected. In addition, we incur costs and make capital expenditures for new program awards based upon certain estimates of production volumes and production complexity. While we attempt to recover such costs and capital expenditures by appropriately pricing our products, the prices of our products are based in part upon planned production volumes. If the actual production is significantly less than planned or significantly more complex than anticipated, we may be unable to recover such costs. In addition, because a significant portion of our overall costs is fixed, declines in our customers’ production levels can adversely affect the level of our reported profits even if our up-front investments are recovered.6Table of Contents We may not realize all of the sales expected from our existing backlog or anticipated orders. At December 31, 2021, we had $904.6 million of order backlog, the majority of which related to Aerospace OEM customers, as compared with $832.7 million at the end of 2020. Of the 2021 year-end backlog, $689.6 million was attributable to Aerospace and $215.0 million was attributable to Industrial. Approximately 55% of the Company's consolidated year-end backlog is expected to be recognized during 2022, with the remainder scheduled to be recognized after 2022. There can be no assurances that the revenues projected in our backlog will be realized or, if realized, will result in profits. We consider backlog to be firm customer orders for future delivery. OEM customers may provide projections of components and assemblies that they anticipate purchasing in the future under existing programs. These projections may represent orders that are beyond lead time and are included in backlog when supported by a long term agreement. Our customers may have the right under certain circumstances or with certain penalties or consequences to terminate, reduce or defer firm orders that we have in backlog. If this occurs, we may be protected from certain costs and losses, but our sales will nevertheless be adversely affected. Although we strive to maintain strong relationships with our customers, there is an ongoing risk that orders may be canceled or rescheduled due to fluctuations in our customers’ business requirements. Also, our realization of sales from new and existing programs is inherently subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties, including whether our customers execute the launch of programs on time, or at all, the number of units that our customers actually produce, the timing of production and manufacturing insourcing decisions made by our customers. In addition, until firm orders are placed, our customers may have the right to discontinue a program or replace us with another supplier at any time without penalty. Our failure to realize sales from new and existing programs could have a material adverse effect on our net sales, results of operations and cash flows. We face risks of cost overruns and losses on fixed-price contracts and orders in backlog. We sell certain of our products under firm, fixed-price contracts providing for a fixed price for the products regardless of the production or purchase costs incurred by us, which includes certain orders in backlog, some of which have long lead times. The cost of producing and delivering products may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, outside processing, freight, shipping, overhead and other factors, including manufacturing inefficiencies. Such increased costs may result in cost overruns and losses on contracts. Original equipment manufacturers in the aerospace and transportation industries have significant pricing leverage over suppliers and may be able to achieve price reductions over time. Additionally, we may not be successful in our efforts to raise prices on our customers. While many of our customers permit periodic adjustments to pricing based on changes in component prices and other factors, we may bear the risk of price increases that occur between any such repricing or, if such repricing is not permitted, during the balance of the term of the particular customer contract. There is substantial and continuing pressure from OEMs in the aerospace and transportation industries, including automotive, to reduce the prices they pay to suppliers. We attempt to manage such downward pricing pressure, while trying to preserve our business relationships with our customers, by seeking to reduce our production costs through various measures, including purchasing raw materials and components at lower prices and implementing cost-effective process improvements. Our suppliers have periodically resisted, and in the future may resist, pressure to lower their prices and may seek to impose price increases. If we are unable to offset OEM price reductions, our profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, OEMs have substantial leverage in setting purchasing and payment terms, including the terms of accelerated payment programs under which payments are made prior to the account due date in return for an early payment discount. OEMs can unexpectedly change their purchasing policies and/or payment practices, which could have a negative impact on our short-term working capital. We operate in highly competitive markets. Our future growth is dependent upon our ability to bring to market competitive, and increasingly complex, new products and services that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins. Our two global business segments compete with a number of larger and smaller companies in the markets we serve. Some of our competitors have greater financial, production, research and development, or other resources than we do. Within Aerospace, certain of our OEM customers compete with our repair and overhaul business, and some compete with us where they have the ability to manufacture the components and assemblies that we supply to them but have chosen, for capacity limitations, cost considerations or other reasons, to outsource the manufacturing to us. Our customers award business based on, among other things, price, quality, reliability of supply, service, technology and design. Our competitors’ efforts to grow market share could exert downward pressure on our product pricing and margins. Our competitors may also develop products or services, or methods of delivering those products or services, that are superior to ours. In addition, our competitors may adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with our existing or future competitors. The industries in which we operate have been experiencing consolidation, both in our suppliers and the customers we serve. Supplier consolidation is in part attributable to OEMs more frequently awarding long-term sole source or preferred supplier contracts to the most capable suppliers in an effort to reduce the total number of suppliers. If consolidation of our 7Table of Contents existing competitors or customers occurs, we would expect the competitive pressures we face to increase, and we cannot assure you that our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows will not be adversely impacted as a result.Our operations focus on highly engineered components which require extensive engineering and research and development time. Moreover, our ability to develop new products and services and to compete successfully will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to make investments of significant resources. These efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, may not lead to the development of new products or services on a timely basis, and may require us to reduce costs by such means as reducing excess capacity, improving productivity, eliminating redundancies and increasing production in low-cost countries. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, in increasing our manufacturing footprint in low-cost countries. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or that we will be successful in maintaining our competitive position. If we are unable to differentiate our products and services or maintain a low-cost footprint, we may lose market share or be forced to reduce prices, thereby lowering our margins. Our competitive advantage may be adversely impacted if we cannot continue to introduce new products ahead of our competition, or if our products are rendered obsolete by other products or by new, different technologies and processes. The success of our new products will depend on a number of factors, including innovation, customer acceptance, the efficiency of our suppliers in providing materials and component parts, and the performance and quality of our products relative to those of our competitors. Additionally, we may face increased or unexpected costs associated with new product introduction, including the use of additional resources such as personnel and capital. We cannot provide assurance that we will not experience new product introduction delays in the future. As we introduce new products, we may be unable to detect and correct defects in product design. Even after introduction, new or enhanced products may not satisfy customer preferences and product failures may cause customers to reject our products. As a result, these products may not achieve market acceptance and our brand image could suffer. Any such occurrences could significantly reduce our revenues, increase our operating costs, or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The development of new products and services presents security risks. An increasing number of our products and services, including our moldMIND® product line, are delivered with digital capabilities and the accompanying interconnected device networks, some of which include sensors, data, and advanced computing capabilities. If we are unable to manage the lifecycle cybersecurity risk in development, deployment and operation of our digital platforms and services, the possible consequences include financial loss, reputational damage, exposure to legal claims or enforcement actions, theft of intellectual property, the diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.A significant portion of the sales of certain businesses within our Industrial segment are realized from the design, manufacture, distribution and service of highly-engineered and customized products and systems for plastic injection molding and plastics processing across a broad spectrum of applications. Sales volume is dependent upon the need for equipment used to produce plastic products, which may be significantly influenced by the demand for plastic products, the capital investment needs of companies in the plastic injection molding and plastics processing industries, changes in technological advances, and changes in laws or regulations such as those related to single-use plastics, product and packaging composition, and recycling. Decrease in demand for plastic products or equipment used in the production of plastic products or unfavorable developments in these industries generally could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Demand for our defense-related products depends on government spending. A portion of Aerospace's sales is derived from defense markets, including single-sourced and dual-sourced sales. The defense market is largely dependent upon government budgets and is subject to governmental appropriations. Although multi-year contracts may be authorized in connection with major procurements, funds are generally appropriated on a fiscal year basis even though a program may be expected to continue for several years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded and additional funds are committed only as further appropriations are made. We cannot assure you that maintenance of or increases in defense spending will be allocated to programs that would benefit our business. Moreover, we cannot assure you that new defense-related aircraft programs in which we participate will enter full-scale production as expected. A decrease in levels of defense spending or the government’s termination of, or failure to fully fund, one or more of the contracts for the programs in which we participate could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.The aerospace industry is highly regulated. Complications related to aerospace regulations may adversely affect the Company. A substantial portion of our income is derived from our aerospace businesses. The aerospace industry is highly regulated in the U.S. by the Federal Aviation Administration and in other countries by similar regulatory agencies. We must be certified by these agencies and, in some cases, by individual OEMs in order to engineer, produce and service systems and 8Table of Contents components used in specific aircraft models. If material authorizations or approvals were delayed, suspended or revoked, our business could be adversely affected. In the future, new or more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted or industry oversight heightened, and we may incur significant expenses to comply with any such new regulations or heightened industry oversight. Fluctuations in the price of jet fuel, resins, energy and other raw materials and their availability may impact our operating results. Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of operating expenses for companies in the aerospace industry. Fluctuations in fuel costs could impact levels and frequency of aircraft maintenance and overhaul activities, and airlines' decisions on maintaining, deferring or canceling new aircraft purchases, in part based on the value associated with new fuel efficient technologies. Increases in fuel prices can also increase our packaging and transportation costs. Both we and our customers purchase supplies of resins, which are oil-based components used in the manufacture of certain products, and any significant increases in resin costs could adversely impact future operating results, including as a result of customers' decisions on maintaining, deferring or canceling new programs. Weather-related events, natural disasters, political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, changes in governmental policy concerning aircraft fuel production, changes in refining capacity, and other unpredictable events may result in future fuel supply shortages and fuel price increases. For example, widespread disruption to oil production, refinery operations and pipeline capacity in certain areas of the U.S. can impact the price of jet fuel significantly. Geopolitical conflicts, such as conflicts in the Middle East, an important source of oil for the U.S. and other countries where we do business, cause prices for fuel to be volatile. In addition, new laws or regulations adopted in response to climate change could increase energy and transportation costs, as well as the costs of certain raw materials and components. Recently, the costs of certain raw materials, transportation and energy necessary for our operations and the production and distribution of our products have increased significantly. While we have implemented cost containment measures and selective price increases, as well as taken other actions to offset these inflationary pressures in our supply chain, we may not be able to completely offset all the increases in our operational costs, and there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING A GLOBAL BUSINESS AND REGULATORY RISKSOur operations depend on our global manufacturing, sales and service facilities and information systems which are subject to physical, environmental, operational and other risks that could disrupt our operations. We have a significant number of manufacturing facilities, technical service centers, and sales and distribution centers both within and outside the U.S. The global scope of our business subjects us to increased risks and uncertainties such as threats of war, terrorism and instability of governments, and economic, regulatory and legal systems in countries in which we or our customers conduct business. In addition, our customers' and suppliers' facilities, as well as our own facilities, are located in areas that may be affected by natural disasters, including earthquakes, windstorms, droughts and floods, or by limited accessibility to sufficient water resources, which could cause significant physical damage and disruption to our equipment and facilities, as well as the infrastructure of our customers and suppliers, and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, some of our manufacturing equipment and tooling is custom-made and is not readily replaceable. Loss of such equipment or tooling could have a negative impact on our manufacturing capabilities and, as a result, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. A major catastrophe such as an earthquake, windstorm, drought, flood or other natural disaster, infectious disease outbreak, significant labor strikes, work stoppages, or political unrest, in any of the areas where we or our customers or key suppliers conduct operations could result in a prolonged interruption of our business. Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in the manufacture or shipment of products or the provision of repair and other services that may result in our loss of sales and customers. Although we have obtained property damage and business interruption insurance, our insurance will not cover all potential risks, and we cannot assure you that we will have adequate insurance to compensate us for all losses that result from any insured risks. Any material loss not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We cannot assure you that insurance will be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us or at a cost that will not have a material adverse effect on our profitability, net income and cash flows.The global nature of our operations subjects us to financial and regulatory risks in the countries in which we and our customers, suppliers and other business partners operate. In addition, we sell or may in the future sell our products and services to the U.S. and foreign governments and in foreign countries. As a global business, we are subject to complex laws, regulations and other conditions in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate, and associated risks, including: U.S.-imposed embargoes of sales to specific countries; foreign import controls; import regulations and duties; export regulations (which require us to comply with stringent licensing regimes); reporting requirements regarding the use of ""conflict"" minerals mined from certain countries; anti-dumping regulations; unclaimed property laws; price and currency controls; dividend remittance restrictions; expropriation of assets; war, civil uprisings and riots; government instability; government-imposed economic uncertainties, such as a prolonged U.S. federal government shutdown; government contracting requirements 9Table of Contents including cost accounting standards and various procurement, security and audit requirements, as well as requirements to certify to the government compliance with these requirements; the necessity of obtaining governmental approval for new and continuing products and operations; and legal systems or decrees, laws, taxes, regulations, interpretations and court decisions that are not always fully developed and that may be retroactively or arbitrarily applied. We have experienced inadvertent violations of some of these regulations, including export regulations and regulations prohibiting sales of certain products in the past, none of which has had or, we believe, will have a material adverse effect on our business. Any significant violations of these or other regulations in the future could result in civil or criminal sanctions, suspension of production, loss of export or other licenses, other restrictions on our operations or damage to our reputation. We may also be subject to unanticipated income taxes, excise and custom duties, import taxes, export taxes, value added taxes, or other governmental assessments, and taxes may be impacted by changes in legislation in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, our organizational and capital structure may limit our ability to transfer funds between countries without incurring adverse tax consequences. Any of these events could result in a loss of business or other unexpected costs that could reduce sales or profits and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are subject to environmental laws and regulations and the risk of environmental liabilities, violations and litigation. We are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the health and safety of our employees, the generation, storage, use, transportation and disposal of certain materials including hazardous materials, emissions or discharges of substances into the environment, and investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites. Our operations involve the use of substances subject to these laws and regulations, primarily those used in manufacturing processes. Our failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities; suspension of production; alteration of our manufacturing; damage to our reputation; and restrictions on our operations or sales. Furthermore, environmental laws outside of the U.S. are becoming more stringent, resulting in increased costs and compliance burdens. In addition, certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at their properties or at properties from or upon which they have disposed of hazardous substances. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities or private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances. The ultimate cost of site cleanup and timing of future cash outflows is difficult to predict, given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods.The costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations, or liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances, may exceed our estimates, or have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.Climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change, may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations. Climate change resulting from increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could present risks to our future operations from natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, wildfires, droughts or flooding. Such extreme weather conditions could pose physical risks to our facilities and disrupt operation of our supply chain and may impact operational costs. The impacts of climate change on global water resources may result in water scarcity, which could in the future impact our ability to access sufficient quantities of water in certain locations and result in increased costs. Concern over climate change will likely result in new legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change. Further, our customers and the markets we serve may impose emissions reduction or other environmental standards and requirements, including plastic injection molding and plastics processing and conventional fuel-based automotive markets. As a result, we may experience increased compliance burdens and operational costs and raw material sourcing, manufacturing operations and the distribution of our products may be adversely affected. Moreover, we may not be able to timely meet these requirements due to the required level of capital investment or technological advancement. While we have been committed to continuous improvements to meet anticipated regulations and preferences, there can be no assurance that our commitments will be successful, that our products will be accepted by the market, that proposed regulations will not have a negative competitive impact or that economic returns will reflect our investments in new product development. There also continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. These factors may impact the demand for our products, obsolescence of certain products and adversely affect our results of operations.As of the date of this filing, we have made several public commitments regarding our intended reduction of carbon emissions, water consumption and waste generation. Although we intend to meet these commitments, we may be required to expend significant resources to do so, which could increase our operational costs. Further, there can be no assurance of the 10Table of Contents extent to which any of our commitments will be achieved, or that any future investments we make in furtherance of achieving such targets and goals will meet investor expectations or any binding or non-binding legal standards regarding sustainability performance. Moreover, we may determine that it is in the best interest of our Company and our stockholders to prioritize other business, social, governance or sustainability investments over the achievement of our current commitments based on economic, regulatory and social factors, business strategy or pressure from investors, activist groups or other stakeholders. If we are unable to meet these commitments, then we could incur adverse publicity and reaction from investors, activist groups our other stakeholders, which could adversely impact the perception of us and our products and services by current and potential customers, as well as investors, which could in turn adversely impact our results of operations.We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA"") and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws and data privacy and security laws. The FCPA and similar anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining an unfair advantage. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Our operations outside the United States, including in developing countries, expose us to the risk of such violations. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. Despite our training and compliance program, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations, or allegations, could damage our reputation, as well as result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties, termination of relationships with business partners and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions, and as a result might materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Additionally, to conduct our operations, we regularly move data across borders, and consequently we are subject to a variety of increasingly complex and changing laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, use, transmission and protection of personal information and other customer, vendor or employee data. The interpretation and enforcement of such laws and regulations, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, are continuously developing and evolving and there is significant uncertainty with respect to how compliance with these laws and regulations may evolve and the costs and complexity of future compliance. Violations could result in substantial fines, sanctions or civil penalties, damage to our reputation and might materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.International trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position. Our results could be impacted by changes in tariffs, trade agreements or other trade restrictions imposed or agreed to by the U.S. or foreign governments. For example, a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Trade restrictions, including withdrawal from or modification of existing trade agreements, negotiation of new trade agreements, and imposition of new (and retaliatory) tariffs against certain countries or covering certain products, including developments in U.S.-China trade relations, has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, customers, suppliers and/or the U.S. or foreign economies or certain sectors thereof in which we compete, and impair our ability to expand our business by offering new technologies, products and services. It remains unclear what the U.S. federal government or foreign governments will or will not do in the future with respect to tariffs or other international trade agreements and policies. Trade restrictions, and changes in or uncertainty surrounding global trade policies, may adversely impact our competitive position, businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The global nature of our business exposes us to foreign currency fluctuations that may affect our future revenues, debt levels and profitability. As noted above, we have manufacturing facilities and technical service centers, and sales and distribution centers around the world, and the majority of our foreign operations use the local currency as their functional currency. These include, among others, the Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Czech koruna, Chinese renminbi, Euro, Japanese yen, Korean won, Malaysian ringgit, Mexican peso, Singaporean dollar, Swedish krona, and the Swiss franc. Since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies expose us to translation risk when the local currency financial statements are translated to U.S. dollars. Changes in currency exchange rates may also expose us to transaction risk. We may buy hedges in certain currencies to reduce or offset our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations; however, these transactions may not be adequate or effective to protect us against unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations. We have not engaged in any speculative hedging activities. Currency fluctuations may adversely impact our revenues and profitability in the future. RISKS RELATED TO SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURINGThe ability of suppliers to deliver raw materials, parts and components and energy resources, and our ability to manufacture without disruption, could affect our results of operations. We use a wide range of materials (including steel, 11Table of Contents stainless steel, titanium, aluminum, Inconel, Hastelloys and other specialty materials) and components (including semiconductors and other electronic components) in the global production of our products, which come from numerous suppliers around the world. Our operations and those of our suppliers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including COVID-19 related supplier plant shutdowns or slowdowns, transportation delays, work stoppages, labor shortages, price inflation, financial issues such as supplier bankruptcy, information technology failures, and hazards such as fire, earthquakes, flooding, droughts or other natural disasters, new laws or regulations, global economic or political events including terrorist attacks and war, and suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers. Because not all of our business arrangements provide for guaranteed supply, and some key raw materials, parts and components and energy resources may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers, we are subject to supply and pricing risk. For example, we expect to continue to be impacted by the following supply chain issues, due to economic, political and other factors largely beyond our control: increased material costs and component shortages, supply chain disruptions and delays, and cost inflation, all of which could continue or escalate in the future. The effects of climate change, including extreme weather events, long-term changes in temperature levels, water availability, supply costs impacted by increasing energy costs, or energy costs impacted by carbon prices or offsets may exacerbate these risks. Such disruptions could interrupt our ability to manufacture certain products and result in increased pricing, and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Any product liability, warranty, contractual or other claims may harm our business or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. We are exposed to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of our products and the products we buy from third parties and sell to our customers, and to potential warranty, contractual or other claims. Our products are complex and may contain defects, errors, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance, due to any number of issues, including issues in materials, design, fabrication, packaging and/or use within a system or item of equipment. Further, because of the complexity of our products, defects or errors might only be detected when the products are in use. Development of new products increases complexity and adds risk to manufacturing reliability, and increases the likelihood of product defects or errors. Risks associated with product defects are exacerbated by the fact that our customers typically integrate our products into other equipment and systems. Our products may be responsible for critical functions in our customers’ products. Failure of our products to perform to specifications, or other product defects, could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell to our customers, the equipment and/or systems into which our products are integrated and to the end users of such equipment/and or systems. Such defects could give rise to warranty claims or claims under indemnification clauses in our agreements, which may range from individual customer claims to full recalls of all products in the field, and result in significant costs, including costs related to developing solutions, recalling products, inspecting, repairing or replacing defective products, or writing down defective inventory, and could result in the loss of sales and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts. In addition, defects in our products could result in failure to achieve market acceptance, a loss of participation in customer programs, a shifting of business to our competitors, and litigation or regulatory action against us, and could harm our reputation, our relationships with customers and our ability to attract new customers, as well as the perceptions of our brands. Other potential adverse impacts of product defects include shipment delays, write-offs of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, and losses on unfavorable purchase commitments. Moreover, the occurrence of defects may give rise to product liability claims, particularly if defects in our products or the products into which they are integrated result in personal injury or death, and could result in significant costs, expenses and losses. For example, we may be exposed to potential liability for personal injury, property damage or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft or automotive component designed, manufactured or sold by us, or the failure of an aircraft or automotive component that has been serviced by us or of the components themselves. If a product liability claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant, and could divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business, even if we are successful. We may be named in product liability claims even if there is no evidence that our products caused the damage in question, and even though we may have indemnity from our customers, and such claims could result in significant costs and expenses. We vigorously defend ourselves in connection with these matters. We cannot, however, assure you that the costs, charges and liabilities associated with these matters will not be material, or that those costs, charges and liabilities will not exceed any amounts reserved for them in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Further, while we have liability insurance for certain risks, our insurance may not cover all liabilities, including potential reputational impacts. Additionally, insurance coverage may not be available in the future on acceptable terms or at a cost acceptable to us. The above is exacerbated by the fact that our products may be used, and perform critical functions, in various high-risk applications such as aerospace, automobiles, and robotics, among others. Accordingly, defects in our products could have an adverse impact on us, on our customers and the end users of our customers’ products. If any of these risks materialize, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.12Table of Contents RISKS RELATED TO HUMAN CAPITALOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract, develop, engage and retain qualified employees. Our executive officers and key management personnel are critical to driving business performance and successfully executing the Company’s growth strategy. Because of the complex nature of many of our products and services, and our focus on technological and product innovations, we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilled workforce, including our engineering talent and our sales professionals. We manage human capital through our Talent Management System, which is aimed at enhancing our ability to attract and hire talented employees, as well as supporting their growth, development and engagement; however, we cannot guarantee the system's effectiveness. Failure to attract, develop, engage and retain qualified employees, whether as a result of an insufficient number of qualified applicants, difficulty in recruiting new employees, or inadequate resources to train, integrate and retain qualified employees, could impair our ability to execute our business strategy, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, while we aim to reduce the impact of the departure of employees, our operations or ability to execute our business strategy may be impacted by the loss of employees, particularly when departures involve groups of employees, such as the restructuring and workforce reduction actions taken in 2020. Such losses may adversely affect the Company through decreased employee morale, the loss of knowledge of departing employees, and the devotion of resources to reorganizing and reassigning job roles and responsibilities, and could increase the risk of claims or litigation from former employees.Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted by strikes or work stoppages. We employ approximately 5,100 people worldwide. Approximately 30% of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, trade union agreements and/or national industry agreements. Although we believe that our relations with our employees and labor unions that represent our employees are good, and we have experienced no material strikes or work stoppages recently, we cannot assure you that we will not experience in the future these and other types of conflicts with labor unions, works councils, other groups representing employees or our employees generally, nor that any future negotiations with our labor unions will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor, including healthcare, pensions or other benefits. Any potential strikes or work stoppages, and the resulting adverse impact on our relationships with customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Similarly, a protracted strike or work stoppage at any of our major customers, suppliers or other vendors could materially adversely affect our business.RISKS RELATED TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, CYBERSECURITY AND DATA PRIVACYAny disruption or failure in the operation of our information systems, including from conversions or integrations of information technology (“IT”) or reporting systems, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our IT systems are an integral part of our business. We depend upon our IT systems to help communicate internally and externally, to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities, such as processing orders, managing inventory, making payments, collecting accounts receivable, and storing information. We are relying on our IT infrastructure to support our operations as we manage the impact of COVID-19, including through initiating remote-work protocols for a substantial number of our employees in regions impacted by the spread of the virus. In addition, our IT systems allow us to purchase, sell and ship products efficiently and on a timely basis, to maintain cost-effective operations, and to help provide superior service to our customers. Moreover, we use IT systems to record, process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. We periodically implement, upgrade and integrate IT systems, such as our enterprise resource planning (""ERP"") and customer relationship management (“CRM”) platforms across our businesses. If we experience a problem with the functioning of an important IT system as a result of the increased burden placed on our IT infrastructure or a security breach, including during system upgrades and/or new system implementations, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business or operating results.Increased cybersecurity requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted IT-related crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, data and services and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In the ordinary course of our business, we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information in our data centers and on our networks. In addition to traditional IT systems, we leverage cloud-based systems, where data is stored and exchanged with external third party vendors. The secure maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our business operations. Despite our security measures, our IT systems and infrastructure, including vendor-hosted systems, may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. These cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to IT systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced 13Table of Contents persistent threats, directed at the Company, its products, its customers and/or its third-party service providers, including cloud providers. These threats and incidents originate from many sources globally and include malwares that take the form of computer viruses, ransomware, worms, Trojan horses, spyware, adware, scareware, rogue software, and programs that act against the computer user. Our customers are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections, and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands. We seek to deploy measures to deter, prevent, detect, respond to and mitigate these threats, including identity and access controls and vulnerability assessments, but, despite these efforts, cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could compromise our networks and the information stored there, including critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties), could be accessed, altered, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Such incidents could remain undetected for an extended period of time, and the losses arising from such incidents could exceed our available insurance coverage for such matters. Such incidents could also disrupt our operations, result in increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, theft of intellectual property, and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position. Further, cybersecurity and data protection laws and regulations continue to evolve in the U.S. and worldwide. This adds compliance complexity and may increase our costs of compliance and expose us to litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions or fines in one or more jurisdictions. In addition, as security threats continue to evolve and increase in frequency and sophistication, it will likely require investing in additional resources to protect the security of our IT systems.RISKS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights. Our intellectual property rights may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage, and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. As patents expire, we could face increased competition, which could negatively impact our operating results. Infringement of our intellectual property and other proprietary rights by a third party could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities. We cannot be certain that the measures we have implemented will prevent our intellectual property from being improperly disclosed, challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. For example, competitors may avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. We may need to spend significant resources monitoring and enforcing our intellectual property rights and we may not be aware of or able to detect or prove infringement by third parties. Our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the protection and enforceability of those rights in some countries. If we seek to enforce our intellectual property rights, we may be subject to claims that those rights are invalid or unenforceable, and others may seek counterclaims against us, which could have a negative impact on our business. In addition, changes in intellectual property laws or their interpretation may impact our ability to protect and assert our intellectual property rights, increase costs and uncertainties in the prosecution of patent applications and enforcement or defense of issued patents, and diminish the value of our intellectual property. If we do not protect and enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, or if they are circumvented, invalidated, or rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, it could have an adverse impact on our competitive position and our operating results. Our employees, consultants and other parties are subject to confidentiality obligations, but this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation, theft, misuse, disclosure, loss or destruction of our proprietary information and/or infringement of our intellectual property. For example, employees and former employees, in particular former employees who become employees of our competitors, may misappropriate, use, publish or provide to our competitors, customers or other third parties our intellectual property or other proprietary information. Similarly, we provide access to certain of our intellectual property and other proprietary information to our direct and indirect customers and certain of our consultants who may wrongfully use or disclose such intellectual property or information. Any of these events could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, cause us to lose business, damage our reputation, subject us to legal or regulatory proceedings, cause us to incur other loss or liability and otherwise adversely affect our business. Third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. Regardless of the merit of such claims, any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming to defend and resolve due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation, and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. A claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement, which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all, require us to redesign our products, which would be costly and time-consuming, or subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against the development and sale of certain of our products or services. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement. In addition, we may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade 14Table of Contents secrets and other confidential business information. Any such incidents and claims could severely harm our business and reputation, result in significant expenses, harm our competitive position, and prevent us from selling certain products, all of which could have a significant adverse impact on our business and results of operations. RISKS RELATED TO LIQUIDITY AND OTHER RISKS We have significant indebtedness that could affect our operations and financial condition, and our failure to meet certain financial covenants required by our debt agreements may materially and adversely affect our assets, financial position and cash flows. At December 31, 2021, we had consolidated debt obligations of $603.7 million, representing approximately 30% of our total capital (indebtedness plus stockholders’ equity) as of that date. Our level of indebtedness, proportion of variable rate debt obligations and the significant debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness may adversely affect our operations and financial condition. For example, our indebtedness could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, investments in technology and research and development, acquisitions, dividends and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industries in which we compete; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors, some of whom have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources than we do; limit our ability to borrow additional funds; or increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. In addition, a majority of our debt arrangements require us to maintain certain debt and interest coverage ratios and limit our ability to incur debt, make investments or undertake certain other business activities. These requirements could limit our ability to obtain future financing and may prevent us from taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. Our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our debt arrangements may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the restrictions could result in an event of default under our debt arrangements which, in turn, could result in an event of default under the terms of our other indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our debt arrangements, after the expiration of any grace periods, our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our debt arrangements, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to happen, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the payments due under those arrangements or our other indebtedness or that we could find alternative financing to replace that indebtedness. Conditions in the worldwide credit markets may limit our ability to expand our credit lines beyond current bank commitments. In addition, our profitability may be adversely affected as a result of increases in interest rates. At December 31, 2021, we and our subsidiaries had $603.7 million aggregate principal amount of consolidated debt obligations outstanding, of which approximately 66% had interest rates that float with the market (not hedged against interest rate fluctuations). A 100 basis point increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in effect at December 31, 2021 would result in an approximate $4.0 million annualized increase in interest expense. We have significant goodwill and an impairment of our goodwill could cause a decline in our net worth. Our total assets include substantial goodwill. At December 31, 2021, our goodwill totaled $955.4 million. The goodwill results from our prior acquisitions, representing the excess of the purchase price we paid over the net assets of the companies acquired. We assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill during each calendar year or more frequently if an event or change in circumstances indicates that the fair value of a reporting unit has been reduced below its carrying value. If future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units does not meet expectations or fair values fall due to significant stock market declines, we may be required to reflect a non-cash charge to operating results for goodwill impairment. The recognition of an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material. See “Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies”. We may not realize all of the intangible assets related to the Aerospace Aftermarket businesses. We participate in aftermarket RSPs under which we receive an exclusive right to supply designated aftermarket parts over the life of the related aircraft engine program to our customer, GE. As consideration, we pay participation fees, which are recorded as intangible assets and are recognized as a reduction of sales over the estimated life of the related engine programs. Our total investments in participation fees under our RSPs as of December 31, 2021 equaled $299.5 million, all of which have been paid. At December 31, 2021, the remaining unamortized balance of these participation fees was $147.5 million. We entered into CRPs, also with GE, which provide for, among other items, the right to sell certain aftermarket component repair services for CFM56, CF6, CF34 and LM engines directly to other customers over the life of the engine program as one of a few GE licensed suppliers. In addition, the CRPs extended certain contracts under which the Company currently provides these services directly to GE. Our total investments in CRPs as of December 31, 2021 equaled $111.8 million, all of which have been paid. At December 31, 2021, the remaining unamortized balance of the CRPs was $76.2 15Table of Contents million. We recorded the CRP payments as intangible assets which are recognized as a reduction of sales over the remaining useful life of these engine programs.The realizability of each asset is dependent upon future revenues related to the programs' aftermarket parts and services and is subject to impairment testing if circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. The potential exists that actual revenues will not meet expectations due to a change in market conditions, including, for example, the replacement of older engines with new, more fuel-efficient engines or our ability to maintain market share within the aftermarket business. A shortfall in future revenues may result in the failure to realize the net amount of the investments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, profitability could be impacted by the amortization of the participation fees and licenses, and the expiration of the international tax incentives on these programs. See “Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies”. We carry significant inventories and a loss in net realizable value could cause a decline in our net worth. At December 31, 2021, our inventories totaled $239.7 million. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value based on management's judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels, quantities and prices at which such inventories will be sold in the normal course of business. Accelerating the disposal process or changes in estimates of future sales potential may necessitate future reduction to inventory values. See “Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies”. We maintain pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the U.S. and certain international locations. Our costs of providing defined benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on the plans’ assets, interest rates, exchange rate fluctuations, future governmental regulation, global fixed income and equity prices, and our required and/or voluntary contributions to the plans. Declines in the stock market, prevailing interest rates, declines in discount rates, improvements in mortality rates and rising medical costs may cause an increase in our pension and other postretirement benefit expenses in the future and result in reductions in our pension fund asset values and increases in our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. These changes have caused and may continue to cause a significant reduction in our net worth and without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans’ assets, and depending upon the other factors listed above, we could be required to increase funding for some or all of these pension and postretirement plans. Changes in taxation requirements could affect our financial results. Our products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions in which we operate. Increases in indirect taxes could affect our products’ affordability and therefore reduce our sales. We are also subject to income tax in numerous jurisdictions in which we generate revenues. Changes in tax laws, tax rates or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. Among other things, our tax liabilities are affected by the mix of pretax income or loss among the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and the potential repatriation of foreign earnings to the U.S. Further, during the ordinary course of business, we are subject to examination by the various tax authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate which could result in an unanticipated increase in taxes. Any potential changes or interpretive guidance may impact current and deferred income tax expense and deferred tax balances for U.S operations as well as the potential future repatriation of foreign income. The impact of any proposed changes in tax regulations may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Changes in accounting guidance could affect our financial results. New accounting guidance that may become applicable to us from time to time, or changes in the interpretations of existing guidance, could have a significant effect on our reported results for the affected periods. Adoption of new accounting guidance could have a material impact on our financial statements and may retroactively affect the accounting treatment of transactions completed before adoption. See Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.Actions of activist stockholders could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management’s attention and resources, and have an adverse effect on our business. From time to time, we may be subject to proposals by stockholders urging us to take certain corporate actions. If activist stockholder activities ensue, our business could be adversely affected because responding to proxy contests and reacting to other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees. For example, we may be required to retain the services of various professionals to advise us on activist stockholder matters, including legal, financial, and communications advisers, the costs of which may negatively impact our future financial results. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy or leadership created as a consequence of activist stockholder initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, harm our ability to attract new investors, customers, and employees, and cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation. 16Table of Contents RISKS RELATED TO STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS Our restructuring actions could have long-term adverse effects on our business. From time to time, we have implemented restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future. We may not achieve expected cost savings from workforce reductions or restructuring activities and actual charges, costs and adjustments due to these actions may vary materially from our estimates. Our ability to realize anticipated cost savings, synergies and revenue enhancements may be affected by a number of factors, including the following: our ability to effectively eliminate duplicative back office overhead and overlapping sales personnel, rationalize manufacturing capacity, synchronize IT systems, consolidate warehousing and other facilities and shift production to more economical facilities, significant cash and non-cash integration and implementation costs or charges in order to achieve those cost savings, which could offset any such savings; and our ability to avoid labor disruption in connection with these activities. In addition, delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements may diminish the expected operational or financial benefits. Our acquisition and other strategic initiatives, some of which may be outside the industries in which we currently operate, may not be successful. We have made a number of acquisitions in the past, and we anticipate that we may, from time to time, acquire additional businesses, assets or securities of companies, and enter into joint ventures and other strategic relationships that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our businesses. These activities expose the Company to a number of risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of any of which could materially adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. A portion of the industries that we serve are mature industries. As a result, our future growth may depend in part on the successful acquisition and integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations. On the other hand, if we acquire a company that operates in an industry that is different from the ones in which we currently operate, our lack of experience with that company's industry could have a material adverse impact on our ability to manage that business and realize the benefits of that acquisition. We may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions, obtain financing on satisfactory terms, negotiate reasonable terms, properly perform due diligence and determine all the significant risks associated with a particular acquisition, avoid diversion of our management's attention from other important business activities, or obtain regulatory approvals or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future. We could have difficulties integrating acquired businesses with our existing operations, including coordinating and consolidating separate systems, retaining market acceptance of acquired products and services, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees, and implementing our enterprise resource planning systems and operational procedures and disciplines. Any such difficulties may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with employees, customers, business partners and suppliers. In addition, even if integration is successful, the financial performance of acquired businesses may not be as expected and there can be no assurance that we will realize anticipated benefits from our acquisitions. We cannot assure you that we will effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business or product offerings or realize anticipated operational synergies. These activities may result in difficulties, significant expense and accounting charges, disrupt our business or divert management’s time and attention.Acquisitions involve numerous other risks, including potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business. Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired businesses require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the business operations before we acquired it. However, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial condition. In connection with acquisitions or joint venture investments outside the U.S., we may enter into derivative contracts to purchase foreign currency in order to hedge against the risk of foreign currency fluctuations in connection with such acquisitions or joint venture investments, which subjects us to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations associated with such derivative contracts. Additionally, our final determinations and appraisals of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions may vary materially from earlier estimates. We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment, and we cannot be certain that our business, operating results and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected. A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to any purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to retain, reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business, and collect the proceeds from any divestitures. In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other products offered by us. All 17Table of Contents of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. In addition, divestitures of businesses involve a number of risks, including significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships, and a decrease in revenues and earnings associated with the divested business. Furthermore, divestitures potentially involve significant post-closing separation activities, which could involve the expenditure of material financial resources and significant employee resources. Any divestiture may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the dilutive impact from the loss of revenue associated with the divestiture, as well as significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition"
3,B,BARNES GROUP INC,2021-02-22,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks. Please note that additional risks not presently known to us may also materially impact our business and operations.  RISKS RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMICThe recent coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has had an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and we expect its impact will continue, at least in the near term. COVID-19 has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility, uncertainty and disruption within financial markets. COVID-19 has adversely affected, and continues to pose risks to, our business, including our operational and financial performance. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our performance depends on numerous evolving factors, many of which continue to be highly uncertain, including, among other things, the duration and spread of COVID-19, its severity, and the actions taken in response to it; the effect on our customers and customer demand for our products and services; our ability to sell and provide our products and services, including as a result of travel restrictions and “shelter in place” orders; the ability of our customers to pay for our products and services; and when and to what extent normal business, economic and social activity and conditions resume. There is risk that a significant number of our employees, or employees who perform critical functions, become ill and/or are quarantined as the result of exposure, or that government policies restrict the ability of those employees to perform their critical functions; or of closures of our offices and facilities as well as those of our customers and suppliers. Customers may also decelerate decision making, delay planned work or seek to terminate existing agreements. Logistics and transportation availability may be reduced or become more costly due to the prioritization of vaccine shipments. An extended 5Table of Contentperiod of global supply chain and economic disruption could materially affect our business, results of operations, access to sources of liquidity and financial condition. COVID-19 has had and continues to have a material impact on the air travel and aviation industries. Several countries, including the United States, have taken steps to restrict air travel, and many companies have adopted policies prohibiting or curtailing non-essential business travel by their employees. Even in the absence of formal restrictions and prohibitions, contagious illness and fear of contagion have adversely affected travel behavior which may continue. Current travel restrictions, as well as changes in the propensity for the general public to travel by air as a result of COVID-19, has caused reductions in demand for commercial aircraft. If COVID-19 continues to have a material impact on the airline and aviation industry, including on General Electric (""GE"") and our other large customers, it could continue to materially affect the business and results of operations of our Aerospace business. The widespread outbreak of another illness or any other communicable disease, or any other public health crisis, may likewise adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESSES AND THE INDUSTRIES WITHIN WHICH WE OPERATE We depend on revenues and earnings from a small number of significant customers. Any bankruptcy of or loss of or cancellation, reduction or delay in purchases by these customers could harm our business. Net sales to GE and its subsidiaries in 2020 accounted for 17% of our total sales and approximately 55% of Aerospace's net sales. Aerospace's second and third largest customers, Rolls-Royce and Raytheon Technologies Corporation and their respective subsidiaries, accounted for 15% and 5%, respectively, of Aerospace's net sales in 2020. Approximately 5% of Aerospace's net sales in 2020 were to its next three largest customers. Approximately 10% of Industrial's sales in 2020 were to its four largest customers. Some of our success will depend on the business strength and viability of those customers. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our largest customers. Some of our customers may in the future reduce their purchases due to economic conditions or shift their purchases from us to our competitors, in-house or to other sources. Some of our long-term sales agreements provide that the customer may unilaterally reduce or discontinue its projected purchases without penalty or terminate for convenience. The loss of one or more of our largest customers, any reduction, cancellation or delay in sales to these customers (including a reduction in aftermarket volume in our Aerospace Aftermarket business' Revenue Sharing Programs), our inability to successfully develop relationships with new customers, or future price concessions we make to retain customers could significantly reduce our sales and profitability. We may not recover all of our up-front costs related to new or existing programs. New programs may require significant up-front investments for capital equipment, engineering, inventory, design and tooling. As OEMs in the transportation and aerospace industries have looked to suppliers to bear increasing responsibility for the design, engineering and manufacture of systems and components, they have increasingly shifted the financial risk associated with those responsibilities to the suppliers as well. This trend may continue and is most evident in the area of engineering cost reimbursement. We cannot assure you that we will have adequate funds to make such up-front investments or to recover such costs from our customers as part of our product pricing or through sales volume. In such event, our profitability, liquidity and cash flows may be adversely affected. In addition, we incur costs and make capital expenditures for new program awards based upon certain estimates of production volumes and production complexity. While we attempt to recover such costs and capital expenditures by appropriately pricing our products, the prices of our products are based in part upon planned production volumes. If the actual production is significantly less than planned or significantly more complex than anticipated, we may be unable to recover such costs. In addition, because a significant portion of our overall costs is fixed, declines in our customers’ production levels can adversely affect the level of our reported profits even if our up-front investments are recovered.We may not realize all of the sales expected from our existing backlog or anticipated orders. At December 31, 2020, we had $832.7 million of order backlog, the majority of which related to Aerospace OEM customers, as compared with $1,080.0 million at the end of 2019. Of the 2020 year-end backlog, $582.2 million was attributable to Aerospace and $250.5 million was attributable to Industrial. Approximately 60% of the Company's consolidated year-end backlog is scheduled to be shipped during 2021, with the remainder scheduled to be shipped after 2021. There can be no assurances that the revenues projected in our backlog will be realized or, if realized, will result in profits. We consider backlog to be firm customer orders for future delivery. OEM customers may provide projections of components and assemblies that they anticipate purchasing in the future under existing programs. These projections may represent orders that are beyond lead time and are included in backlog when supported by a long term agreement. Our customers may have the right under certain circumstances or with certain penalties or consequences to terminate, reduce or defer firm orders that we have in backlog. If this occurs, we may be protected from certain costs and losses, but our sales will nevertheless be adversely affected. Although we strive to maintain strong relationships with our customers, there is an ongoing risk that orders may be canceled or rescheduled due to fluctuations in our customers’ business requirements.6Table of Content Also, our realization of sales from new and existing programs is inherently subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties, including whether our customers execute the launch of programs on time, or at all, the number of units that our customers actually produce, the timing of production and manufacturing insourcing decisions made by our customers. In addition, until firm orders are placed, our customers may have the right to discontinue a program or replace us with another supplier at any time without penalty. Our failure to realize sales from new and existing programs could have a material adverse effect on our net sales, results of operations and cash flows. We face risks of cost overruns and losses on fixed-price contracts. We sell certain of our products under firm, fixed-price contracts providing for a fixed price for the products regardless of the production or purchase costs incurred by us. The cost of producing products may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, outside processing, overhead and other factors, including manufacturing inefficiencies. Increased production costs may result in cost overruns and losses on contracts. Original equipment manufacturers in the aerospace and transportation industries have significant pricing leverage over suppliers and may be able to achieve price reductions over time. Additionally, we may not be successful in our efforts to raise prices on our customers. There is substantial and continuing pressure from OEMs in the aerospace and transportation industries, including automotive, to reduce the prices they pay to suppliers. We attempt to manage such downward pricing pressure, while trying to preserve our business relationships with our customers, by seeking to reduce our production costs through various measures, including purchasing raw materials and components at lower prices and implementing cost-effective process improvements. Our suppliers have periodically resisted, and in the future may resist, pressure to lower their prices and may seek to impose price increases. If we are unable to offset OEM price reductions, our profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, OEMs have substantial leverage in setting purchasing and payment terms, including the terms of accelerated payment programs under which payments are made prior to the account due date in return for an early payment discount. OEMs can unexpectedly change their purchasing policies or payment practices, which could have a negative impact on our short-term working capital. We operate in highly competitive markets. We may not be able to compete effectively with our competitors, and competitive pressures could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our two global business segments compete with a number of larger and smaller companies in the markets we serve. Some of our competitors have greater financial, production, research and development, or other resources than we do. Within Aerospace, certain of our OEM customers compete with our repair and overhaul business. Some of our OEM customers in the aerospace industry also compete with us where they have the ability to manufacture the components and assemblies that we supply to them but have chosen, for capacity limitations, cost considerations or other reasons, to outsource the manufacturing to us. Our customers award business based on, among other things, price, quality, reliability of supply, service, technology and design. Our competitors’ efforts to grow market share could exert downward pressure on our product pricing and margins. Our competitors may also develop products or services, or methods of delivering those products or services, that are superior to ours. In addition, our competitors may adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with our existing or future competitors. Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to make investments to innovate and manufacture the types of products demanded by our customers, and to reduce costs by such means as reducing excess capacity, leveraging global purchasing, improving productivity, eliminating redundancies and increasing production in low-cost countries. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, in increasing our manufacturing footprint in low-cost countries. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or that we will be successful in maintaining our competitive position. If we are unable to differentiate our products and services or maintain a low-cost footprint, we may lose market share or be forced to reduce prices, thereby lowering our margins. Any such occurrences could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The industries in which we operate have been experiencing consolidation, both in our suppliers and the customers we serve. Supplier consolidation is in part attributable to OEMs more frequently awarding long-term sole source or preferred supplier contracts to the most capable suppliers in an effort to reduce the total number of suppliers. If consolidation of our existing competitors or customers occurs, we would expect the competitive pressures we face to increase, and we cannot assure you that our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows will not be adversely impacted as a result.Our products and services may be rendered obsolete, or otherwise impacted by proposed regulations affecting product and packaging composition and disposability. Our manufacturing operations focus on highly engineered components which require extensive engineering and research and development time. Our competitive advantage may be adversely impacted if we cannot continue to introduce new products ahead of our competition, or if our products are rendered obsolete by other products or by new, different technologies and processes. The success of our new products will depend on a 7Table of Contentnumber of factors, including innovation, customer acceptance, the efficiency of our suppliers in providing materials and component parts, and the performance and quality of our products relative to those of our competitors. We cannot predict the level of market acceptance or the amount of market share or production share our new products will achieve. Additionally, we may face increased or unexpected costs associated with new product introduction, including the use of additional resources such as personnel and capital. We cannot provide assurance that we will not experience new product introduction delays in the future.A significant portion of the sales of certain businesses within our Industrial segment are realized from the design, manufacture, distribution, and service of highly-engineered and customized products and systems for plastic injection molding and plastics processing across a broad spectrum of applications. Decrease in demand for plastic products or equipment used in the production of plastic products, changes in technological advances, or changes in laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  Sales volume is dependent upon the need for equipment used to produce plastic products, which may be significantly influenced by the demand for plastics, the capital investment needs of companies in the plastic injection molding and plastics processing industries, changes in technological advances, or changes in laws or regulations such as, but not limited to, those related to single-use plastics, product and packaging composition, and recycling. Unfavorable developments in these industries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Demand for our defense-related products depends on government spending. A portion of Aerospace's sales is derived from  defense markets, including single-sourced and dual-sourced sales. The defense market is largely dependent upon government budgets and is subject to governmental appropriations. Although multi-year contracts may be authorized in connection with major procurements, funds are generally appropriated on a fiscal year basis even though a program may be expected to continue for several years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded and additional funds are committed only as further appropriations are made. We cannot assure you that maintenance of or increases in defense spending will be allocated to programs that would benefit our business. Moreover, we cannot assure you that new defense-related aircraft programs in which we participate will enter full-scale production as expected. A decrease in levels of defense spending or the government’s termination of, or failure to fully fund, one or more of the contracts for the programs in which we participate could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.The aerospace industry is highly regulated. Complications related to aerospace regulations may adversely affect the Company. A substantial portion of our income is derived from our aerospace businesses. The aerospace industry is highly regulated in the U.S. by the Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, and in other countries by similar regulatory agencies. We must be certified by these agencies and, in some cases, by individual OEMs in order to engineer, produce and service systems and components used in specific aircraft models. If material authorizations or approvals were delayed, revoked or suspended, our business could be adversely affected. New or more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted, or industry oversight heightened, in the future, and we may incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or any heightened industry oversight. Fluctuations in jet fuel and other energy prices and availability may impact our operating results. Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of operating expenses for companies in the aerospace industry. Fluctuations in fuel costs could impact levels and frequency of aircraft maintenance and overhaul activities, and airlines' decisions on maintaining, deferring or canceling new aircraft purchases, in part based on the value associated with new fuel efficient technologies. Weather-related events, natural disasters, political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, changes in governmental policy concerning aircraft fuel production, changes in refining capacity, environmental concerns such as climate change, greenhouse gases and aircraft emissions, and other unpredictable events may result in future fuel supply shortages and fuel price increases. For example, widespread disruption to oil production, refinery operations and pipeline capacity in certain areas of the U.S. can impact the price of jet fuel significantly. Geopolitical conflicts, such as conflicts in the Middle East, an important source of oil for the U.S. and other countries where we do business, cause prices for fuel to be volatile. These fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING A GLOBAL BUSINESSOur operations depend on our global manufacturing, sales, and service facilities and information systems which are subject to physical, environmental, operational and other risks that could disrupt our operations. We have a significant number of manufacturing facilities, technical service centers, and sales and distribution centers both within and outside the U.S. The global scope of our business subjects us to increased risks and uncertainties such as threats of war, terrorism and instability of governments; and economic, regulatory and legal systems in countries in which we or our customers conduct business. 8Table of ContentOur customers' and suppliers' facilities, as well as our own facilities, are located in areas that may be affected by natural disasters, including earthquakes, windstorms and floods, which could cause significant damage and disruption to the operations of those facilities and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, some of our manufacturing equipment and tooling is custom-made and is not readily replaceable. Loss of such equipment or tooling could have a negative impact on our manufacturing capabilities and, as a result, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. A major catastrophe such as an earthquake, windstorm, flood or other natural disaster at any of our sites, infectious disease outbreaks, or significant labor strikes, work stoppages, political unrest, or any of the events described above, in any of the areas where we or our customers conduct operations could result in a prolonged interruption of our business. Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in the manufacture or shipment of products or the provision of repair and other services that may result in our loss of sales and customers. Although we have obtained property damage and business interruption insurance, our insurance will not cover all potential risks, and we cannot assure you that we will have adequate insurance to compensate us for all losses that result from any insured risks. Any material loss not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We cannot assure you that insurance will be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us or at a cost that will not have a material adverse effect on our profitability, net income and cash flows.The global nature of our operations subjects us to financial and regulatory risks in the countries in which we and our customers, suppliers and other business counterparties operate. In addition, we sell or may in the future sell our products and services to the U.S. and foreign governments and in foreign countries. As noted above, we are subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental, health, and safety concerns, including those regulating the handling, storage, discharge, and disposal of certain materials used in or derived from our manufacturing processes. Our failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities; suspension of production; alteration of our manufacturing; damage to our reputation; and restrictions on our operations or sales. As a global business, we are also subject to other complex laws, regulations and other conditions in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate, and associated risks, including: U.S. imposed embargoes of sales to specific countries; foreign import controls; import regulations and duties; export regulations (which require us to comply with stringent licensing regimes); reporting requirements regarding the use of ""conflict"" minerals mined from certain countries; anti-dumping regulations; price and currency controls; dividend remittance restrictions; expropriation of assets; war, civil uprisings and riots; government instability; government-imposed economic uncertainties, such as a prolonged U.S. federal government shutdown; government contracting requirements including cost accounting standards, including various procurement, security, and audit requirements, as well as requirements to certify to the government compliance with these requirements; the necessity of obtaining governmental approval for new and continuing products and operations; and legal systems or decrees, laws, taxes, regulations, interpretations and court decisions that are not always fully developed and that may be retroactively or arbitrarily applied. We have experienced inadvertent violations of some of these regulations, including export regulations, safety and environmental regulations, and regulations prohibiting sales of certain products in the past, none of which has had or, we believe, will have a material adverse effect on our business.We may be subject to potential material liabilities relating to any investigation and clean-up of our locations or properties where we delivered hazardous waste for handling or disposal that may be contaminated or which may have been contaminated prior to our purchase, and to claims alleging personal injury. Any significant violations of these or other regulations in the future could result in civil or criminal sanctions, and the loss of export or other licenses which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are subject to state unclaimed property laws in the ordinary course of business and are currently undergoing a multi-state unclaimed property audit which is expected to close in 2021 and result in a payment by the Company of an immaterial amount. We may also be subject to unanticipated income taxes, excise and custom duties, import taxes, export taxes, value added taxes, or other governmental assessments, and taxes may be impacted by changes in legislation in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, our organizational and capital structure may limit our ability to transfer funds between countries without incurring adverse tax consequences. Any of these events could result in a loss of business or other unexpected costs that could reduce sales or profits and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA"") and similar worldwide anti-corruption law and data privacy and security laws. The FCPA and similar anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining an unfair advantage. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Our operations outside the United States, including in developing countries, expose us to the risk of such violations. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. Despite our training and compliance program, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations, or allegations, could damage our reputation, as well as result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties, termination of relationships with business partners and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions, and as a result might materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 9Table of ContentAdditionally, to conduct our operations, we regularly move data across borders, and consequently we are subject to a variety of increasingly complex and changing laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, use, transmission and protection of personal information and other customer, vendor or employee data. The interpretation and enforcement of such laws and regulations, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, are continuously developing and evolving and there is significant uncertainty with respect to how compliance with these laws and regulations may evolve and the costs and complexity of future compliance. Violations could result in substantial fines, sanctions or civil penalties, damage to our reputation and might materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.International trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position. Our results could be impacted by changes in tariffs, trade agreements or other trade restrictions imposed or agreed to by the U.S. or foreign governments. For example, a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Trade restrictions, including withdrawal from or modification of existing trade agreements, negotiation of new trade agreements, and imposition of new (and retaliatory) tariffs against certain countries or covering certain products, including developments in U.S.-China trade relations, has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, customers, suppliers and/or the U.S. or foreign economies or certain sectors thereof in which we compete, and impair our ability to expand our business by offering new technologies, products and services. It remains unclear what the U.S. federal government or foreign governments will or will not do in the future with respect to tariffs or other international trade agreements and policies. Trade restrictions, and changes in or uncertainty surrounding global trade policies, may adversely impact our competitive position, businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The global nature of our business exposes us to foreign currency fluctuations that may affect our future revenues, debt levels and profitability. As noted above, we have manufacturing facilities and technical service centers, and sales and distribution centers around the world, and the majority of our foreign operations use the local currency as their functional currency. These include, among others, the Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Czech koruna, Chinese renminbi, Euro, Japanese yen, Korean won, Malaysian ringgit, Mexican peso, Singaporean dollar, Swedish krona, and the Swiss franc. Since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies expose us to translation risk when the local currency financial statements are translated to U.S. dollars. Changes in currency exchange rates may also expose us to transaction risk. We may buy hedges in certain currencies to reduce or offset our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations; however, these transactions may not be adequate or effective to protect us against unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations. We have not engaged in any speculative hedging activities. Currency fluctuations may adversely impact our revenues and profitability in the future. RISKS RELATED TO SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURINGChanges in the availability or price of materials, products and energy resources could adversely affect our costs and profitability. We may be adversely affected by the availability or price of raw materials, products and energy resources, particularly related to certain manufacturing operations that utilize steel, stainless steel, titanium, aluminum, Inconel, Hastelloys and other specialty materials. The availability and price of raw materials and energy resources may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, new laws or regulations, global economic or political events including strikes, terrorist attacks and war, suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. In some instances, there are limited sources for certain raw materials and a limited number of primary suppliers for some of our products for resale. Although we are not dependent upon any single source for any of our principal raw materials or products for resale, and such materials and products have, historically, been readily available, we cannot assure you that such raw materials and products will continue to be readily available. Disruption in the supply of raw materials, products or energy resources or our inability to come to favorable agreements with our suppliers could impair our ability to manufacture, sell and deliver our products and require us to pay higher prices. Any increase in prices for such raw materials, products or energy resources could materially adversely affect our costs and our profitability. Any product liability, warranty, contractual or other claims may harm our business or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. We are exposed to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of our products and the products we buy from third parties and sell to our customers, and to potential warranty, contractual or other claims. Our products are complex and may contain defects, errors, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance, due to any number of issues, including issues in materials, design, fabrication, packaging and/or use within a system or item of equipment. Further, because of the complexity of our products, defects or errors might only be detected when the products are in use. Development of new products increases complexity and adds risk to manufacturing reliability, and increases the likelihood of product defects or errors. Risks associated with product defects are exacerbated by the fact that our customers 10Table of Contenttypically integrate our products into other equipment and systems. Our products may be responsible for critical functions in our customers’ products. Failure of our products to perform to specifications, or other product defects, could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell to our customers, the equipment and/or systems into which our products are integrated and to the end users of such equipment/and or systems. Such defects could give rise to warranty claims or claims under indemnification clauses in our agreements, which may range from individual customer claims to full recalls of all products in the field, and result in significant costs, including costs related to developing solutions, recalling products, inspecting, repairing or replacing defective products, or writing down defective inventory, and could result in the loss of sales and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts. In addition, defects in our products could result in failure to achieve market acceptance, a loss of participation in customer programs, a shifting of business to our competitors, and litigation or regulatory action against us, and could harm our reputation, our relationships with customers and our ability to attract new customers, as well as the perceptions of our brands. Other potential adverse impacts of product defects include shipment delays, write-offs of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, and losses on unfavorable purchase commitments. Moreover, the occurrence of defects may give rise to product liability claims, particularly if defects in our products or the products into which they are integrated result in personal injury or death, and could result in significant costs, expenses and losses. For example, we may be exposed to potential liability for personal injury, property damage or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft or automotive component designed, manufactured or sold by us, or the failure of an aircraft or automotive component that has been serviced by us or of the components themselves. If a product liability claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant, and could divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business, even if we are successful. We may be named in product liability claims even if there is no evidence that our products caused the damage in question, and even though we may have indemnity from our customers, and such claims could result in significant costs and expenses. We vigorously defend ourselves in connection with these matters. We cannot, however, assure you that the costs, charges and liabilities associated with these matters will not be material, or that those costs, charges and liabilities will not exceed any amounts reserved for them in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Further, while we have liability insurance for certain risks, our insurance may not cover all liabilities, including potential reputational impacts. Additionally, insurance coverage may not be available in the future on acceptable terms or at a cost acceptable to us. The above is exacerbated by the fact that our products may be used, and perform critical functions, in various high-risk applications such as aerospace, automobiles, and robotics, among others. Accordingly, defects in our products could have an adverse impact on us, on our customers and the end users of our customers’ products. If any of these risks materialize, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.RISKS RELATED TO HUMAN CAPITALOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract, develop, engage and retain qualified employees. Our executive officers and key management personnel are critical to driving business performance and successfully executing the Company’s growth strategy. Because of the complex nature of many of our products and services, and our focus on technological and product innovations, we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilled workforce, including our engineering talent and our sales professionals. We manage human capital through our Talent Management System, which is aimed at enhancing our ability to attract and hire talented employees, as well as supporting their growth, development and engagement; however, we cannot guarantee the system's effectiveness. Failure to attract, develop, engage and retain qualified employees, whether as a result of an insufficient number of qualified applicants, difficulty in recruiting new employees, or inadequate resources to train, integrate and retain qualified employees, could impair our ability to execute our business strategy, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, while we aim to reduce the impact of the departure of employees, our operations or ability to execute our business strategy may be impacted by the loss of employees, particularly when departures involve groups of employees, such as the restructuring and workforce reduction actions taken in 2020. Such losses may adversely affect the Company through decreased employee morale, the loss of knowledge of departing employees, and the devotion of resources to reorganizing and reassigning job roles and responsibilities, and could increase the risk of claims or litigation from former employees.Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted by strikes or work stoppages. Approximately 15% of our U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements (""CBAs"") and approximately 40% of our non-U.S. employees are covered by CBAs, trade union agreements or national industry agreements. The Company has a national CBA with certain unionized employees at the Bristol, Connecticut and Corry, Pennsylvania facilities of the Associated Spring business unit covering approximately 200 employees which expires in August 2021, at which time we expect to negotiate a successor agreement. The local CBA for the Bristol, Connecticut facility of the Associated Spring business unit will also expire in August 2021, at which time we expect to negotiate a successor agreement. We also have annual negotiations in Brazil and Mexico and, collectively, these negotiations cover approximately 250 employees in those two 11Table of Contentcountries. In addition, we expect to negotiate successor agreements to the local CBAs in Singapore, Germany and Sweden, collectively covering approximately 650 employees, given these agreements will expire in 2021. We completed negotiations resulting in wage adjustments at four locations in our Industrial Segment, collectively, covering a total of approximately 300 employees. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are good, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in negotiating new CBAs or that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor, including healthcare, pensions or other benefits. Any potential strikes or work stoppages, and the resulting adverse impact on our relationships with customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Similarly, a protracted strike or work stoppage at any of our major customers, suppliers or other vendors could materially adversely affect our business.RISKS RELATED TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, CYBERSECURITY AND DATA PRIVACYAny disruption or failure in the operation of our information systems, including from conversions or integrations of information technology (“IT”) or reporting systems, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our IT systems are an integral part of our business. We depend upon our IT systems to help communicate internally and externally, to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities, such as processing orders, managing inventory, making payments, collecting accounts receivable, and storing information. Our IT systems also allow us to purchase, sell and ship products efficiently and on a timely basis, to maintain cost-effective operations, and to help provide superior service to our customers. Moreover, we use IT systems to record, process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. During the process of implementing, upgrading and integrating our IT systems, such as our enterprise resource planning (""ERP"") and customer relationship management (“CRM”) platforms across our businesses, our IT systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns. Any failure in the secure operation of our IT systems could adversely affect our business or operating results.  Increased cybersecurity requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, data and services and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In the ordinary course of our business, we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information in our data centers and on our networks. In addition to traditional IT systems, we leverage cloud-based systems, where data is stored and exchanged with external third party vendors. The secure maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our business operations. Despite our security measures, our IT systems and infrastructure, including vendor-hosted systems, may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, altered, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could disrupt our operations, result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position. Further, cybersecurity and data protection laws and regulations continue to evolve in the U.S. and worldwide. This adds compliance complexity and may increase our costs of compliance and expose us to litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions or fines in one or more jurisdictions. In addition, as security threats continue to evolve and increase in frequency and sophistication, we may need to invest additional resources to protect the security of our IT systems. RISKS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights. Our intellectual property rights may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage, and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. As patents expire, we could face increased competition, which could negatively impact our operating results. Infringement of our intellectual property and other proprietary rights by a third party could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities. We cannot be certain that the measures we have implemented will prevent our intellectual property from being improperly disclosed, challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. For example, competitors may avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. We may need to spend significant resources monitoring and enforcing our intellectual property rights and we may not be aware of or able to detect or prove infringement by third parties. Our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the protection and enforceability of those rights in some countries. If we seek to enforce our intellectual property rights, we may be subject to claims that those rights are invalid or unenforceable, and others may seek counterclaims against us, which could have a negative impact on our business. In addition, changes in intellectual property laws or their interpretation may impact our ability to protect and assert our intellectual 12Table of Contentproperty rights, increase costs and uncertainties in the prosecution of patent applications and enforcement or defense of issued patents, and diminish the value of our intellectual property. If we do not protect and enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, or if they are circumvented, invalidated, or rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, it could have an adverse impact on our competitive position and our operating results. Our employees, consultants and other parties are subject to confidentiality obligations, but this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation, theft, misuse, disclosure, loss or destruction of our proprietary information and/or infringement of our intellectual property. For example, employees and former employees, in particular former employees who become employees of our competitors, may misappropriate, use, publish or provide to our competitors, customers or other third parties our intellectual property or other proprietary information. Similarly, we provide access to certain of our intellectual property and other proprietary information to our direct and indirect customers and certain of our consultants who may wrongfully use or disclose such intellectual property or information. Any of these events could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, cause us to lose business, damage our reputation, subject us to legal or regulatory proceedings, cause us to incur other loss or liability and otherwise adversely affect our business. Third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. Regardless of the merit of such claims, any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming to defend and resolve due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation, and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. A claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement, which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all, require us to redesign our products, which would be costly and time-consuming, or subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against the development and sale of certain of our products or services. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement. In addition, we may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets and other confidential business information. Any such incidents and claims could severely harm our business and reputation, result in significant expenses, harm our competitive position, and prevent us from selling certain products, all of which could have a significant adverse impact on our business and results of operations. RISKS RELATED TO LIQUIDITY AND OTHER RISKS We have significant indebtedness that could affect our operations and financial condition, and our failure to meet certain financial covenants required by our debt agreements may materially and adversely affect our assets, financial position and cash flows. At December 31, 2020, we had consolidated debt obligations of $704.3 million, representing approximately 34% of our total capital (indebtedness plus stockholders’ equity) as of that date. Our level of indebtedness, proportion of variable rate debt obligations and the significant debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness may adversely affect our operations and financial condition. For example, our indebtedness could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, investments in technology and research and development, acquisitions, dividends and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industries in which we compete; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors, some of whom have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources than we do; limit our ability to borrow additional funds; or increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. In addition, a majority of our debt arrangements require us to maintain certain debt and interest coverage ratios and limit our ability to incur debt, make investments or undertake certain other business activities. These requirements could limit our ability to obtain future financing and may prevent us from taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. Our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our debt arrangements may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the restrictions could result in an event of default under our debt arrangements which, in turn, could result in an event of default under the terms of our other indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our debt arrangements, after the expiration of any grace periods, our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our debt arrangements, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to happen, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the payments due under those arrangements or our other indebtedness or that we could find alternative financing to replace that indebtedness. Conditions in the worldwide credit markets may limit our ability to expand our credit lines beyond current bank commitments. In addition, our profitability may be adversely affected as a result of increases in interest rates. At December 31, 2020, we and our subsidiaries had $704.3 million aggregate principal amount of consolidated debt obligations outstanding, of which approximately 70% had interest rates that float with the market (not hedged against interest rate fluctuations). A 100 13Table of Contentbasis point increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in effect at December 31, 2020 would result in an approximate $5.0 million annualized increase in interest expense. We have significant goodwill and an impairment of our goodwill could cause a decline in our net worth. Our total assets include substantial goodwill. At December 31, 2020, our goodwill totaled $1,011.6 million. The goodwill results from our prior acquisitions, representing the excess of the purchase price we paid over the net assets of the companies acquired. We assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill during each calendar year or more frequently if an event or change in circumstances indicates that the fair value of a reporting unit has been reduced below its carrying value. If future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units does not meet expectations or fair values fall due to significant stock market declines, we may be required to reflect a non-cash charge to operating results for goodwill impairment. The recognition of an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material. See “Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies”. We may not realize all of the intangible assets related to the Aerospace Aftermarket businesses. We participate in aftermarket Revenue Sharing Programs (""RSPs"") under which we receive an exclusive right to supply designated aftermarket parts over the life of the related aircraft engine program to our customer, GE. As consideration, we pay participation fees, which are recorded as intangible assets and are recognized as a reduction of sales over the estimated life of the related engine programs. Our total investments in participation fees under our RSPs as of December 31, 2020 equaled $299.5 million, all of which have been paid. At December 31, 2020, the remaining unamortized balance of these participation fees was $156.3 million. We entered into Component Repair Programs (""CRPs""), also with GE, which provide for, among other items, the right to sell certain aftermarket component repair services for CFM56, CF6, CF34 and LM engines directly to other customers over the life of the engine program as one of a few GE licensed suppliers. In addition, the CRPs extended certain contracts under which the Company currently provides these services directly to GE. Our total investments in CRPs as of December 31, 2020 equaled $111.8 million, all of which have been paid. At December 31, 2020, the remaining unamortized balance of the CRPs was $81.0 million. We recorded the CRP payments as intangible assets which are recognized as a reduction of sales over the remaining useful life of these engine programs.The realizability of each asset is dependent upon future revenues related to the programs' aftermarket parts and services and is subject to impairment testing if circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. The potential exists that actual revenues will not meet expectations due to a change in market conditions, including, for example, the replacement of older engines with new, more fuel-efficient engines or our ability to maintain market share within the aftermarket business. A shortfall in future revenues may result in the failure to realize the net amount of the investments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, profitability could be impacted by the amortization of the participation fees and licenses, and the expiration of the international tax incentives on these programs. See “Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies”. We carry significant inventories and a loss in net realizable value could cause a decline in our net worth. At December 31, 2020, our inventories totaled $238.0 million. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value based on management's judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels, quantities and prices at which such inventories will be sold in the normal course of business. Accelerating the disposal process or changes in estimates of future sales potential may necessitate future reduction to inventory values. See “Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies”. We maintain pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the U.S. and certain international locations. Our costs of providing defined benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on the plans’ assets, interest rates, exchange rate fluctuations, future governmental regulation, global fixed income and equity prices, and our required and/or voluntary contributions to the plans. Declines in the stock market, prevailing interest rates, declines in discount rates, improvements in mortality rates and rising medical costs may cause an increase in our pension and other postretirement benefit expenses in the future and result in reductions in our pension fund asset values and increases in our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. These changes have caused and may continue to cause a significant reduction in our net worth and without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans’ assets, and depending upon the other factors listed above, we could be required to increase funding for some or all of these pension and postretirement plans. 14Table of ContentChanges in taxation requirements could affect our financial results. Our products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions in which we operate. Increases in indirect taxes could affect our products’ affordability and therefore reduce our sales. We are also subject to income tax in numerous jurisdictions in which we generate revenues. Changes in tax laws, tax rates or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. Among other things, our tax liabilities are affected by the mix of pretax income or loss among the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and the potential repatriation of foreign earnings to the U.S. Further, during the ordinary course of business, we are subject to examination by the various tax authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate which could result in an unanticipated increase in taxes. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”). The Act made broad and complex changes to the U.S. Tax Code, including a reduction of the corporate income tax rate, changes to the taxation of foreign unrepatriated earnings, limitations on deduction of interest and compensation expense and the introduction of the global intangible low-taxed income taxes. Any potential changes or interpretive guidance may impact current and deferred income tax expense and deferred tax balances for U.S operations as well as the potential future repatriation of foreign income. The impact of any proposed changes in regulations related to the Act may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. See “Part II - Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- U.S. Tax Reform”.Changes in accounting guidance could affect our financial results. New accounting guidance that may become applicable to us from time to time, or changes in the interpretations of existing guidance, could have a significant effect on our reported results for the affected periods. Adoption of new accounting guidance could have a material impact on our financial statements and may retroactively affect the accounting treatment of transactions completed before adoption. See Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.Actions of activist stockholders could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management’s attention and resources, and have an adverse effect on our business. From time to time, we may be subject to proposals by stockholders urging us to take certain corporate actions. If activist stockholder activities ensue, our business could be adversely affected because responding to proxy contests and reacting to other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees. For example, we may be required to retain the services of various professionals to advise us on activist stockholder matters, including legal, financial, and communications advisers, the costs of which may negatively impact our future financial results. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy or leadership created as a consequence of activist stockholder initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, harm our ability to attract new investors, customers, employees, and joint venture partners, and cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation. RISKS RELATED TO STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS Our restructuring actions could have long-term adverse effects on our business. From time to time, we have implemented restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future. During the current period, for example, we recorded $19.1 million of restructuring charges, primarily related to employee severance and other termination benefits. See “Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”. We may not achieve expected cost savings from workforce reductions or restructuring activities and actual charges, costs and adjustments due to these actions may vary materially from our estimates. Our ability to realize anticipated cost savings, synergies and revenue enhancements may be affected by a number of factors, including the following: our ability to effectively eliminate duplicative back office overhead and overlapping sales personnel, rationalize manufacturing capacity, synchronize information technology systems, consolidate warehousing and other facilities and shift production to more economical facilities; significant cash and non-cash integration and implementation costs or charges in order to achieve those cost savings, which could offset any such savings and other synergies resulting from our acquisitions or divestitures; and our ability to avoid labor disruption in connection with these activities. In addition, delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements may diminish the expected operational or financial benefits. Our acquisition and other strategic initiatives, some of which may be outside the industries in which we currently operate, may not be successful. We have made a number of acquisitions in the past, including the recent acquisition of the Gimatic business, and we anticipate that we may, from time to time, acquire additional businesses, assets or securities of companies, and enter into joint ventures and other strategic relationships that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our businesses. These activities expose the Company to a number of risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of any of which could materially adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. A portion of the industries that we serve are mature industries. As a result, our future growth may depend in part on the successful acquisition and integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations. On the other hand, if we acquire a company that operates in an 15Table of Contentindustry that is different from the ones in which we currently operate, our lack of experience with that company's industry could have a material adverse impact on our ability to manage that business and realize the benefits of that acquisition. We may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions, obtain financing on satisfactory terms, negotiate reasonable terms, properly perform due diligence and determine all the significant risks associated with a particular acquisition, avoid diversion of our management's attention from other important business activities, or obtain regulatory approvals or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future. We could have difficulties integrating acquired businesses with our existing operations. Difficulties of integration can include coordinating and consolidating separate systems, integrating the management of the acquired business, retaining market acceptance of acquired products and services, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees, and implementing our enterprise resource planning systems and operational procedures and disciplines. Any such difficulties may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with employees, customers, business partners and suppliers. In addition, even if integration is successful, the financial performance of acquired business may not be as expected and there can be no assurance we will realize anticipated benefits from our acquisitions. We cannot assure you that we will effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business or product offerings or realize anticipated operational synergies. In connection with the integration of acquired operations or the conduct of our overall business strategies, we may periodically restructure our businesses and/or sell assets or portions of our business. Integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies into our existing operations may result in difficulties, significant expense and accounting charges, disrupt our business or divert management’s time and attention.Acquisitions involve numerous other risks, including potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business. Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired businesses require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the business operations before we acquired it. However, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial condition. In connection with acquisitions or joint venture investments outside the U.S., we may enter into derivative contracts to purchase foreign currency in order to hedge against the risk of foreign currency fluctuations in connection with such acquisitions or joint venture investments, which subjects us to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations associated with such derivative contracts. Additionally, our final determinations and appraisals of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions may vary materially from earlier estimates. We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment, and we cannot be certain that our business, operating results and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected. A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to any purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to retain, reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business, and collect the proceeds from any divestitures. In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other products offered by us. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. In addition, divestitures of businesses involve a number of risks, including significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships, and a decrease in revenues and earnings associated with the divested business. Furthermore, divestitures potentially involve significant post-closing separation activities, which could involve the expenditure of material financial resources and significant employee resources. Any divestiture may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the dilutive impact from the loss of revenue associated with the divestiture, as well as significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition"
14,B,BARNES GROUP INC,2020-02-25,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks. Please note that additional risks not presently known to us may also materially impact our business and operations. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS We depend on revenues and earnings from a small number of significant customers. Any bankruptcy of or loss of or, cancellation, reduction or delay in purchases by these customers could harm our business. In 2019, our net sales to General Electric and its subsidiaries accounted for 21% of our total sales and approximately 55% of Aerospace's net sales. Aerospace's second and third largest customers, Rolls-Royce and United Technologies Corporation and their respective subsidiaries, accounted for 15% and 10%, respectively, of Aerospace's net sales in 2019. Approximately 5% of Aerospace's net sales in 2019 were to its next three largest customers. Approximately 10% of Industrial's sales in 2019 were to its four largest customers. Some of our success will depend on the business strength and viability of those customers. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our largest customers. Some of our customers may in the future reduce their purchases due to economic conditions or shift their purchases from us to our competitors, in-house or to other sources. Some of our long-term sales agreements provide that until a firm order is placed by a customer for a particular product, the customer may unilaterally reduce or discontinue its projected purchases without penalty, or terminate for convenience. The loss of one or more of our largest customers, any reduction, cancellation or delay in sales to these customers (including a reduction in aftermarket volume in our RSPs), our inability to successfully develop relationships with new customers, or future price concessions we make to retain customers could significantly reduce our sales and profitability.  4Table of ContentThe global nature of our business exposes us to foreign currency fluctuations that may affect our future revenues, debt levels and profitability. We have manufacturing facilities and technical service centers, and sales and distribution centers around the world, and the majority of our foreign operations use the local currency as their functional currency. These include, among others, the Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Czech koruna, Chinese renminbi, Euro, Japanese yen, Korean won, Malaysian ringgit, Mexican peso, Singaporean dollar, Swedish krona, and the Swiss franc. Since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies expose us to translation risk when the local currency financial statements are translated to U.S. dollars. Changes in currency exchange rates may also expose us to transaction risk. We may buy hedges in certain currencies to reduce or offset our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations; however, these transactions may not be adequate or effective to protect us against unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations. We have not engaged in any speculative hedging activities. Currency fluctuations may adversely impact our revenues and profitability in the future. Our operations depend on our manufacturing, sales, and service facilities and information systems in various parts of the world which are subject to physical, financial, regulatory, environmental, operational and other risks that could disrupt our operations. We have a significant number of manufacturing facilities, technical service centers, and sales and distribution centers both within and outside the U.S. The global scope of our business subjects us to increased risks and uncertainties such as threats of war, terrorism and instability of governments; and economic, regulatory and legal systems in countries in which we or our customers conduct business. Our customers' and suppliers' facilities, as well as our own facilities, are located in areas that may be affected by natural disasters, including earthquakes, windstorms and floods, which could cause significant damage and disruption to the operations of those facilities and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, some of our manufacturing equipment and tooling is custom-made and is not readily replaceable. Loss of such equipment or tooling could have a negative impact on our manufacturing business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. A major catastrophe such as an earthquake, windstorm, flood or other natural disaster at any of our sites, infectious disease outbreaks, or significant labor strikes, work stoppages, political unrest, or any of the events described above, in any of the areas where we or our customers conduct operations could result in a prolonged interruption of our business. Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in the manufacture or shipment of products or the provision of repair and other services that may result in our loss of sales and customers. Although we have obtained property damage and business interruption insurance, our insurance will not cover all potential risks, and we cannot assure you that we will have adequate insurance to compensate us for all losses that result from any insured risks. Any material loss not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We cannot assure you that insurance will be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us or at a cost that will not have a material adverse effect on our profitability, net income and cash flows.The global nature of our operations and assets subjects us to financial and regulatory risks in the countries in which we and our customers, suppliers and other business counterparties operate. We have operations and assets in various parts of the world. In addition, we sell or may in the future sell our products and services to the U.S. and foreign governments and in foreign countries. As a global business, we are subject to complex laws, regulations and other conditions in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate, and associated risks, including: U.S. imposed embargoes of sales to specific countries; foreign import controls (which may be arbitrarily imposed or enforced); import regulations and duties; export regulations (which require us to comply with stringent licensing regimes); reporting requirements regarding the use of ""conflict"" minerals mined from certain countries; anti-dumping regulations; price and currency controls; exchange rate fluctuations; dividend remittance restrictions; expropriation of assets; war, civil uprisings and riots; government instability; government-imposed economic uncertainties, such as a prolonged U.S. federal government shutdown; government contracting requirements including cost accounting standards, including various procurement, security, and audit requirements, as well as requirements to certify to the government compliance with these requirements; the necessity of obtaining governmental approval for new and continuing products and operations; and legal systems or decrees, laws, taxes, regulations, interpretations and court decisions that are not always fully developed and that may be retroactively or arbitrarily applied. We have experienced inadvertent violations of some of these regulations, including export regulations, safety and environmental regulations, and regulations prohibiting sales of certain products, in the past, none of which has had or, we believe, will have a material adverse effect on our business. However, any significant violations of these or other regulations in the future could result in civil or criminal sanctions, and the loss of export or other licenses which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are subject to state unclaimed property laws in the ordinary course of business, and are currently undergoing a multi-state unclaimed property audit, the timing and outcome of which cannot be specifically predicted. We may also be subject to unanticipated income taxes, excise and custom duties, import taxes, export taxes, value added taxes, or other governmental assessments, and taxes may be impacted by changes in legislation in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, our  5Table of Contentorganizational and capital structure may limit our ability to transfer funds between countries without incurring adverse tax consequences. Any of these events could result in a loss of business or other unexpected costs that could reduce sales or profits and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our results could be impacted by changes in tariffs, trade agreements or other trade restrictions imposed or agreed to by the U.S. or foreign governments. We continue to monitor changes to existing and proposed bilateral or multi-lateral trade agreements and treaties with foreign countries, including the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (“USMCA”) approved by the U.S. Senate on January 16, 2020 and the U.S.-China trade deal. It remains unclear what the U.S. federal government or foreign governments will or will not do in the future with respect to tariffs or other international trade agreements and policies. An escalating trade war or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, customers, suppliers and/or the U.S. or foreign economies or certain sectors thereof in which we compete and, thus, to adversely impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Any disruption or failure in the operation of our information systems, including from conversions or integrations of information technology or reporting systems, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our information technology (""IT"") systems are an integral part of our business. We depend upon our IT systems to help communicate internally and externally, process orders, manage inventory, make payments and collect accounts receivable. Our IT systems also allow us to purchase, sell and ship products efficiently and on a timely basis, to maintain cost-effective operations, and to help provide superior service to our customers. We are currently in the process of implementing enterprise resource planning (""ERP"") platforms across certain of our businesses, and we expect that we will need to continue to improve and further integrate our IT systems, on an ongoing basis in order to effectively run our business. If we fail to successfully manage and integrate our IT systems, including these ERP platforms, it could adversely affect our business or operating results. Increased cybersecurity requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, data and services and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In the ordinary course of our business, we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our business operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, altered, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen.  Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations, and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position. Further, cybersecurity and data protection laws and regulations continue to evolve in the U.S. and worldwide.  This adds compliance complexity and may increase our costs of compliance and expose us to litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions or fines in one or more jurisdictions.   We have significant indebtedness that could affect our operations and financial condition, and our failure to meet certain financial covenants required by our debt agreements may materially and adversely affect our assets, financial position and cash flows. At December 31, 2019, we had consolidated debt obligations of $834.8 million, representing approximately 40% of our total capital (indebtedness plus stockholders’ equity) as of that date. Our level of indebtedness, proportion of variable rate debt obligations and the significant debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness may adversely affect our operations and financial condition. For example, our indebtedness could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, investments in technology and research and development, acquisitions, dividends and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industries in which we compete; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors, some of whom have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources than we do; limit our ability to borrow additional funds; or increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. In addition, a majority of our debt arrangements require us to maintain certain debt and interest coverage ratios and limit our ability to incur debt, make investments or undertake certain other business activities. These requirements could limit our ability to obtain future financing and may prevent us from taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. Our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our debt arrangements may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the restrictions could result in an event of default under our debt arrangements which, in turn, could result in an event of default under the terms of our other indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our debt arrangements, after the expiration of any grace periods, our lenders could  6Table of Contentelect to declare all amounts outstanding under our debt arrangements, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to happen, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the payments due under those arrangements or our other indebtedness or that we could find alternative financing to replace that indebtedness. Conditions in the worldwide credit markets may limit our ability to expand our credit lines beyond current bank commitments.  In addition, our profitability may be adversely affected as a result of increases in interest rates. At December 31, 2019, we and our subsidiaries had $834.8 million aggregate principal amount of consolidated debt obligations outstanding, of which approximately 75% had interest rates that float with the market (not hedged against interest rate fluctuations). A 100 basis point increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in effect at December 31, 2019 would result in an approximate $6.3 million annualized increase in interest expense. Changes in the availability or price of materials, products and energy resources could adversely affect our costs and profitability. We may be adversely affected by the availability or price of raw materials, products and energy resources, particularly related to certain manufacturing operations that utilize steel, stainless steel, titanium, Inconel, Hastelloys and other specialty materials. The availability and price of raw materials and energy resources may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, new laws or regulations, global economic or political events including strikes, terrorist attacks and war, suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. In some instances there are limited sources for raw materials and a limited number of primary suppliers for some of our products for resale. Although we are not dependent upon any single source for any of our principal raw materials or products for resale, and such materials and products have, historically, been readily available, we cannot assure you that such raw materials and products will continue to be readily available. Disruption in the supply of raw materials, products or energy resources or our inability to come to favorable agreements with our suppliers could impair our ability to manufacture, sell and deliver our products and require us to pay higher prices. Any increase in prices for such raw materials, products or energy resources could materially adversely affect our costs and our profitability.  We maintain pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the U.S. and certain international locations. Our costs of providing defined benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on the plans’ assets, interest rates, exchange rate fluctuations, future governmental regulation, global fixed income and equity prices, and our required and/or voluntary contributions to the plans. Declines in the stock market, prevailing interest rates, declines in discount rates, improvements in mortality rates and rising medical costs may cause an increase in our pension and other postretirement benefit expenses in the future and result in reductions in our pension fund asset values and increases in our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. These changes have caused and may continue to cause a significant reduction in our net worth and without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans’ assets, and depending upon the other factors listed above, we could be required to increase funding for some or all of these pension and postretirement plans. We carry significant inventories and a loss in net realizable value could cause a decline in our net worth. At December 31, 2019, our inventories totaled $232.7 million. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value based on management's judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels, quantities and prices at which such inventories will be sold in the normal course of business. Accelerating the disposal process or changes in estimates of future sales potential may necessitate future reduction to inventory values. See “Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies”.  We have significant goodwill and an impairment of our goodwill could cause a decline in our net worth. Our total assets include substantial goodwill. At December 31, 2019, our goodwill totaled $933.0 million. The goodwill results from our prior acquisitions, representing the excess of the purchase price we paid over the net assets of the companies acquired. We assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill during each calendar year or more frequently if an event or change in circumstances indicates that the fair value of a reporting unit has been reduced below its carrying value. If future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units does not meet expectations or fair values fall due to significant stock market declines, we may be required to reflect a non-cash charge to operating results for goodwill impairment. The recognition of an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material. See “Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies”. We may not realize all of the sales expected from our existing backlog or anticipated orders. At December 31, 2019, we had $1,080.0 million of order backlog, the majority of which related to aerospace OEM customers. There can be no assurances that the revenues projected in our backlog will be realized or, if realized, will result in profits. We consider backlog to be firm customer orders for future delivery. OEM customers may provide projections of components and assemblies that they anticipate purchasing in the future under existing programs. These projections may represent orders that are beyond lead  7Table of Contenttime and are included in backlog when supported by a long term agreement. Our customers may have the right under certain circumstances or with certain penalties or consequences to terminate, reduce or defer firm orders that we have in backlog. If our customers terminate, reduce or defer firm orders, we may be protected from certain costs and losses, but our sales will nevertheless be adversely affected. Although we strive to maintain ongoing relationships with our customers, there is an ongoing risk that orders may be canceled or rescheduled due to fluctuations in our customers’ business requirements. Also, our realization of sales from new and existing programs is inherently subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties, including whether our customers execute the launch of product programs on time, or at all, the number of units that our customers actually produce, the timing of production and manufacturing insourcing decisions made by our customers. In addition, until firm orders are placed, our customers may have the right to discontinue a program or replace us with another supplier at any time without penalty. Our failure to realize sales from new and existing programs could have a material adverse effect on our net sales, results of operations and cash flows. We may not recover all of our up-front costs related to new or existing programs. New programs may require significant up-front investments for capital equipment, engineering, inventory, design and tooling. As OEMs in the transportation and aerospace industries have looked to suppliers to bear increasing responsibility for the design, engineering and manufacture of systems and components, they have increasingly shifted the financial risk associated with those responsibilities to the suppliers as well. This trend may continue and is most evident in the area of engineering cost reimbursement. We cannot assure you that we will have adequate funds to make such up-front investments or to recover such costs from our customers as part of our product pricing. In the event that we are unable to make such investments, or to recover them through sales or direct reimbursement from our customers, our profitability, liquidity and cash flows may be adversely affected. In addition, we incur costs and make capital expenditures for new program awards based upon certain estimates of production volumes and production complexity. While we attempt to recover such costs and capital expenditures by appropriately pricing our products, the prices of our products are based in part upon planned production volumes. If the actual production is significantly less than planned or significantly more complex than anticipated, we may be unable to recover such costs. In addition, because a significant portion of our overall costs is fixed, declines in our customers’ production levels can adversely affect the level of our reported profits even if our up-front investments are recovered. We may not realize all of the intangible assets related to the Aerospace aftermarket businesses. We participate in aftermarket Revenue Sharing Programs (""RSPs"") under which we receive an exclusive right to supply designated aftermarket parts over the life of the related aircraft engine program to our customer, General Electric (""GE""). As consideration, we pay participation fees, which are recorded as intangible assets and are recognized as a reduction of sales over the estimated life of the related engine programs. Our total investments in participation fees under our RSPs as of December 31, 2019 equaled $299.5 million, all of which have been paid. At December 31, 2019, the remaining unamortized balance of these participation fees was $164.0 million. We entered into Component Repair Programs (""CRPs""), also with GE, which provide for, among other items, the right to sell certain aftermarket component repair services for CFM56, CF6, CF34 and LM engines directly to other customers over the life of the engine program as one of a few GE licensed suppliers. In addition, the CRPs extended certain contracts under which the Company currently provides these services directly to GE. Our total investments in CRPs as of December 31, 2019 equaled $111.8 million, all of which have been paid. At December 31, 2019, the remaining unamortized balance the CRPs was $84.6 million. We recorded the CRP payments as intangible assets which are recognized as a reduction of sales over the remaining useful life of these engine programs.The realizability of each asset is dependent upon future revenues related to the programs' aftermarket parts and services and is subject to impairment testing if circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. The potential exists that actual revenues will not meet expectations due to a change in market conditions, including, for example, the replacement of older engines with new, more fuel-efficient engines or our ability to maintain market share within the aftermarket business. A shortfall in future revenues may result in the failure to realize the net amount of the investments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, profitability could be impacted by the amortization of the participation fees and licenses, and the expiration of the international tax incentives on these programs. See “Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies”.  We face risks of cost overruns and losses on fixed-price contracts. We sell certain of our products under firm, fixed-price contracts providing for a fixed price for the products regardless of the production or purchase costs incurred by us. The cost of producing products may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, outside processing, overhead and other factors, including manufacturing inefficiencies. Increased production costs may result in cost overruns and losses on contracts.  8Table of ContentThe departure of existing management and key personnel, a shortage of skilled employees or a lack of qualified sales professionals could materially affect our business, operations and prospects. Our executive officers are important to the management and direction of our business. Our future success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain or replace these officers and other key management personnel. Although we believe we will be able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should the need arise, our inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Because of the complex nature of many of our products and services, we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilled workforce, including, for example, our engineering talent. In addition, there are significant costs associated with the hiring and training of sales professionals. We could be adversely affected by a shortage of available skilled employees or the loss of a significant number of our sales professionals. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights effectively or if we are accused of infringing the intellectual parties rights of third parties, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We own or are licensed under various intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks and trade secrets. Our intellectual property rights may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage, and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. In addition, the steps that we have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being improperly disclosed, challenged, invalidated, circumvented or designed-around, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. In some circumstances, enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons, or countries may require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property. We also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, confidential information, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect these intangible assets and will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information. Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage, adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may be the target of enforcement actions by third parties, including aggressive and opportunistic patent enforcement claims by non-practicing entities (so-called “patent trolls”). Regardless of the merit of such claims, responding to and defending against infringement claims can be expensive and time-consuming. If the Company is found to infringe any third-party rights, we could be required to pay substantial damages or we could be enjoined from offering some of our products and services.Any product liability, warranty, contractual or other claims in excess of insurance may adversely affect our financial condition. We are exposed to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of our products and the products we buy from third parties and sell to our customers, and to potential warranty, contractual or other claims. For example, we may be exposed to potential liability for personal injury, property damage or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft or automotive component designed, manufactured or sold by us, or the failure of an aircraft or automotive component that has been serviced by us or of the components themselves. While we have liability insurance for certain risks, our insurance may not cover all liabilities, including potential reputational impacts. Additionally, insurance coverage may not be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us. Any material liability not covered by insurance or for which third-party indemnification is not available for the full amount of the loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.From time to time, we receive product warranty claims, under which we may be required to bear costs of inspection, repair or replacement of certain of our products. Warranty claims may range from individual customer claims to full recalls of all products in the field. We vigorously defend ourselves in connection with these matters. We cannot, however, assure you that the costs, charges and liabilities associated with these matters will not be material, or that those costs, charges and liabilities will not exceed any amounts reserved for them in our Consolidated Financial Statements.  Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted by strikes or work stoppages. Approximately 15% of our U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 45% of our non-U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, trade union agreements, or national industry agreements. The Company has a national collective bargaining agreement (“CBA”) with certain unionized employees at the Bristol, Connecticut and Corry, Pennsylvania facilities of the Associated Spring business unit, covering approximately 250 employees. The current CBA will expire in August 2020, at which time we expect to negotiate a successor agreement. The local CBA for the Bristol, Connecticut facility of the Associated Spring business unit will expire in October 2020, at which time we expect to negotiate a successor agreement. We also have annual negotiations in Brazil and Mexico and, collectively, these negotiations cover approximately 300 employees in those two countries. In addition, we expect to negotiate  9Table of Contentsuccessor agreements to the local CBAs in Singapore, Germany and Sweden, collectively covering approximately 800 employees, given these agreements will expire in 2020. We completed negotiations resulting in wage adjustments at four locations in our Industrial Segment, collectively, covering a total of approximately 500 employees. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are good, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in negotiating new CBAs or that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor, including healthcare, pensions or other benefits. Any potential strikes or work stoppages, and the resulting adverse impact on our relationships with customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Similarly, a protracted strike or work stoppage at any of our major customers, suppliers or other vendors could materially adversely affect our business.Changes in taxation requirements could affect our financial results. Our products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions in which we operate. Increases in indirect taxes could affect our products’ affordability and therefore reduce our sales. We are also subject to income tax in numerous jurisdictions in which we generate revenues. Changes in tax laws, tax rates or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. Among other things, our tax liabilities are affected by the mix of pretax income or loss among the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and the potential repatriation of foreign earnings to the U.S. Further, during the ordinary course of business, we are subject to examination by the various tax authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate which could result in an unanticipated increase in taxes. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”). The Act made broad and complex changes to the U.S. Tax Code that affected 2017 through 2019 and future years, including a reduction of the corporate income tax rate, changes to the taxation of foreign unrepatriated earnings, limitations on deduction of interest and compensation expense and the introduction of the global intangible low-taxed income taxes. Further proposed and final regulations continue to be issued which impact the reporting of current and deferred income taxes. The changes may impact current and deferred income tax expense and deferred tax balances for U.S operations as well as the potential future repatriation of foreign income.  The Company made final entries for income tax expense in the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2018. The impact of any proposed regulations related to the Act may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. See “Part II- Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- U.S. Tax Reform”. Changes in accounting guidance could affect our financial results. New accounting guidance that may become applicable to us from time to time, or changes in the interpretations of existing guidance, could have a significant effect on our reported results for the affected periods. Adoption of new accounting guidance could have a material impact on our financial statements and may retroactively affect the accounting treatment of transactions completed before adoption. See Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.RISKS RELATED TO THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE  We operate in highly competitive markets. We may not be able to compete effectively with our competitors, and competitive pressures could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our two global business segments compete with a number of larger and smaller companies in the markets we serve. Some of our competitors have greater financial, production, research and development, or other resources than we do. Within Aerospace, certain of our OEM customers compete with our repair and overhaul business. Some of our OEM customers in the aerospace industry also compete with us where they have the ability to manufacture the components and assemblies that we supply to them but have chosen, for capacity limitations, cost considerations or other reasons, to outsource the manufacturing to us. Our customers award business based on, among other things, price, quality, reliability of supply, service, technology and design. Our competitors’ efforts to grow market share could exert downward pressure on our product pricing and margins. Our competitors may also develop products or services, or methods of delivering those products or services that are superior to our products, services or methods. Our competitors may adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with our existing or future competitors. Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in part, on our ability to continue make investments to innovate and manufacture the types of products demanded by our customers, and to reduce costs by such means as reducing excess capacity, leveraging global purchasing, improving productivity, eliminating redundancies and increasing production in low-cost countries. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, in increasing our manufacturing footprint in low-cost countries. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or that we will be successful in maintaining our competitive position. If we are unable to differentiate our products or maintain a low-cost footprint, we may lose market share or be forced to reduce prices, thereby lowering our margins. Any such occurrences could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 10Table of ContentThe industries in which we operate have been experiencing consolidation, both in our suppliers and the customers we serve. Supplier consolidation is in part attributable to OEMs more frequently awarding long-term sole source or preferred supplier contracts to the most capable suppliers in an effort to reduce the total number of suppliers from whom components and systems are purchased. If consolidation of our existing competitors occurs, we would expect the competitive pressures we face to increase, and we cannot assure you that our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows will not be adversely impacted as a result of consolidation by our competitors or customers.Original equipment manufacturers in the aerospace and transportation industries have significant pricing leverage over suppliers and may be able to achieve price reductions over time. Additionally, we may not be successful in our efforts to raise prices on our customers. There is substantial and continuing pressure from OEMs in the transportation industries, including automotive and aerospace, to reduce the prices they pay to suppliers. We attempt to manage such downward pricing pressure, while trying to preserve our business relationships with our customers, by seeking to reduce our production costs through various measures, including purchasing raw materials and components at lower prices and implementing cost-effective process improvements. Our suppliers have periodically resisted, and in the future may resist, pressure to lower their prices and may seek to impose price increases. If we are unable to offset OEM price reductions, our profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, OEMs have substantial leverage in setting purchasing and payment terms, including the terms of accelerated payment programs under which payments are made prior to the account due date in return for an early payment discount. OEMs can unexpectedly change their purchasing policies or payment practices, which could have a negative impact on our short-term working capital.  Demand for our defense-related products depends on government spending. A portion of Aerospace's sales is derived from the military market, including single-sourced and dual-sourced sales. The military market is largely dependent upon government budgets and is subject to governmental appropriations. Although multi-year contracts may be authorized in connection with major procurements, funds are generally appropriated on a fiscal year basis even though a program may be expected to continue for several years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded and additional funds are committed only as further appropriations are made. We cannot assure you that maintenance of or increases in defense spending will be allocated to programs that would benefit our business. Moreover, we cannot assure you that new military aircraft programs in which we participate will enter full-scale production as expected. A decrease in levels of defense spending or the government’s termination of, or failure to fully fund, one or more of the contracts for the programs in which we participate could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.The aerospace industry is highly regulated. Complications related to aerospace regulations may adversely affect the Company. A substantial portion of our income is derived from our aerospace businesses. The aerospace industry is highly regulated in the U.S. by the Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, and in other countries by similar regulatory agencies. We must be certified by these agencies and, in some cases, by individual OEMs in order to engineer and service systems and components used in specific aircraft models. If material authorizations or approvals were delayed, revoked or suspended, our business could be adversely affected. New or more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted, or industry oversight heightened, in the future, and we may incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or any heightened industry oversight. During the fourth quarter of 2019, Boeing announced a change to the near-term 737 MAX aircraft production schedule and thereby reduced supplier deliveries in 2020, with the expectation that deliveries would ramp back over a longer period of time. We will be managing our business to minimize any impact to our financial performance, however there can be no assurance that these reduced supplier deliveries will be fulfilled in future periods. The loss of such deliveries could have an adverse effect on our business. Fluctuations in jet fuel and other energy prices may impact our operating results. Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of operating expenses for companies in the aerospace industry. Fluctuations in fuel costs could impact levels and frequency of aircraft maintenance and overhaul activities, and airlines' decisions on maintaining, deferring or canceling new aircraft purchases, in part based on the value associated with new fuel efficient technologies. Widespread disruption to oil production, refinery operations and pipeline capacity in certain areas of the U.S. can impact the price of jet fuel significantly. Conflicts in the Middle East, an important source of oil for the U.S. and other countries where we do business, cause prices for fuel to be volatile. Because we and many of our customers are in the aerospace industry, these fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Our products and services may be rendered obsolete by new products, technologies and processes, or otherwise impacted by proposed regulations affecting product and packaging composition and disposability. Our manufacturing operations focus on highly engineered components which require extensive engineering and research and development time. Our competitive advantage may be adversely impacted if we cannot continue to introduce new products ahead of our competition, or if our products are rendered obsolete by other products or by new, different technologies and processes. The success of our new products will depend on a number of factors, including innovation, customer acceptance, the efficiency of  11Table of Contentour suppliers in providing materials and component parts, and the performance and quality of our products relative to those of our competitors. We cannot predict the level of market acceptance or the amount of market share our new products will achieve. Additionally, we may face increased or unexpected costs associated with new product introduction, including the use of additional resources such as personnel and capital. We cannot assure that we will not experience new product introduction delays in the future. RISKS RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING, ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES AND DIVESTITURES Our restructuring actions could have long-term adverse effects on our business. From time to time, we have implemented restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future. We may not achieve expected cost savings from workforce reductions or restructuring activities and actual charges, costs and adjustments due to these actions may vary materially from our estimates. Our ability to realize anticipated cost savings, synergies and revenue enhancements may be affected by a number of factors, including the following: our ability to effectively eliminate duplicative back office overhead and overlapping sales personnel, rationalize manufacturing capacity, synchronize information technology systems, consolidate warehousing and other facilities and shift production to more economical facilities; significant cash and non-cash integration and implementation costs or charges in order to achieve those cost savings, which could offset any such savings and other synergies resulting from our acquisitions or divestitures; and our ability to avoid labor disruption in connection with these activities. In addition, delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements may diminish the expected operational or financial benefits.     Our acquisition and other strategic initiatives may not be successful. We have made a number of acquisitions in the past, including most recently the acquisitions of the Gimatic and IGS businesses, and we anticipate that we may, from time to time, acquire additional businesses, assets or securities of companies, and enter into joint ventures and other strategic relationships that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our businesses. These activities expose the Company to a number of risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of any of which could materially adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. A portion of the industries that we serve are mature industries. As a result, our future growth may depend in part on the successful acquisition and integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations. We may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions, obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms, obtain regulatory approvals or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future. We could have difficulties integrating acquired businesses with our existing operations. Difficulties of integration can include coordinating and consolidating separate systems, integrating the management of the acquired business, retaining market acceptance of acquired products and services, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees, and implementing our enterprise resource planning systems and operational procedures and disciplines. Any such difficulties may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with employees, customers, business partners and suppliers. In addition, even if integration is successful, the financial performance of acquired business may not be as expected and there can be no assurance we will realize anticipated benefits from our acquisitions. We cannot assure you that we will effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business or product offerings or realize anticipated operational synergies. In connection with the integration of acquired operations or the conduct of our overall business strategies, we may periodically restructure our businesses and/or sell assets or portions of our business. Integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies into our existing operations may result in difficulties, significant expense and accounting charges, disrupt our business or divert management’s time and attention.Acquisitions involve numerous other risks, including potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business. Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired businesses require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the business operations before we acquired it. However, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial condition. In connection with acquisitions or joint venture investments outside the U.S., we may enter into derivative contracts to purchase foreign currency in order to hedge against the risk of foreign currency fluctuations in connection with such acquisitions or joint venture investments, which subjects us to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations associated with such derivative contracts. Additionally, our final determinations and appraisals of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions may vary materially from earlier estimates. We cannot assure you that the fair value of acquired businesses will remain constant. We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment, and we cannot be certain that our business, operating results and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected. A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and  12Table of Contentemployees to any purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to retain, reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business, and collect the proceeds from any divestitures. In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other products offered by us. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of any divestiture transaction, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. In addition, divestitures of businesses involve a number of risks, including significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships, and a decrease in revenues and earnings associated with the divested business. Furthermore, divestitures potentially involve significant post-closing separation activities, which could involve the expenditure of material financial resources and significant employee resources. Any divestiture may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the dilutive impact from the loss of revenue associated with the divestiture, as well as significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition"
10,B,BARNES GROUP INC,2019-02-26,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks. Please note that additional risks not presently known to us may also materially impact our business and operations. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS We depend on revenues and earnings from a small number of significant customers. Any bankruptcy of or loss of or, cancellation, reduction or delay in purchases by these customers could harm our business. In 2018, our net sales to General Electric and its subsidiaries accounted for 18% of our total sales and approximately 54% of Aerospace's net sales. Aerospace's second and third largest customers, Rolls-Royce and United Technologies Corporation and their respective subsidiaries, accounted for 15% and 9%, respectively, of Aerospace's net sales in 2018. Approximately 7% of Aerospace's net sales in 2018 were to its next three largest customers. Approximately 10% of Industrial's sales in 2018 were to its three largest customers. Some of our success will depend on the business strength and viability of those customers. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our largest customers. Some of our customers may in the future reduce their purchases due to  4Table of Contentseconomic conditions or shift their purchases from us to our competitors, in-house or to other sources. Some of our long-term sales agreements provide that until a firm order is placed by a customer for a particular product, the customer may unilaterally reduce or discontinue its projected purchases without penalty, or terminate for convenience. The loss of one or more of our largest customers, any reduction, cancellation or delay in sales to these customers (including a reduction in aftermarket volume in our RSPs), our inability to successfully develop relationships with new customers, or future price concessions we make to retain customers could significantly reduce our sales and profitability. The global nature of our business exposes us to foreign currency fluctuations that may affect our future revenues, debt levels and profitability. We have manufacturing facilities and technical service centers, and sales and distribution centers around the world, and the majority of our foreign operations use the local currency as their functional currency. These include, among others, the Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Czech koruna, Chinese renminbi, Euro, Japanese yen, Korean won, Malaysian ringgit, Mexican peso, Singaporean dollar, Swedish krona, Swiss franc and Thai baht. Since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies expose us to translation risk when the local currency financial statements are translated to U.S. dollars. Changes in currency exchange rates may also expose us to transaction risk. We may buy hedges in certain currencies to reduce or offset our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations; however, these transactions may not be adequate or effective to protect us against unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations. We have not engaged in any speculative hedging activities. Currency fluctuations may adversely impact our revenues and profitability in the future.Our operations depend on our manufacturing, sales, and service facilities and information systems in various parts of the world which are subject to physical, financial, regulatory, environmental, operational and other risks that could disrupt our operations. We have a significant number of manufacturing facilities, technical service centers, and sales and distribution centers both within and outside the U.S. The global scope of our business subjects us to increased risks and uncertainties such as threats of war, terrorism and instability of governments; and economic, regulatory and legal systems in countries in which we or our customers conduct business. Our customers' and suppliers' facilities, as well as our own facilities, are located in areas that may be affected by natural disasters, including earthquakes, windstorms and floods, which could cause significant damage and disruption to the operations of those facilities and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, some of our manufacturing equipment and tooling is custom-made and is not readily replaceable. Loss of such equipment or tooling could have a negative impact on our manufacturing business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Although we have obtained property damage and business interruption insurance, a major catastrophe such as an earthquake, windstorm, flood or other natural disaster at any of our sites, or significant labor strikes, work stoppages, political unrest, or any of the events described above, in any of the areas where we conduct operations could result in a prolonged interruption of our business. Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in the manufacture or shipment of products or the provision of repair and other services that may result in our loss of sales and customers. Our insurance will not cover all potential risks, and we cannot assure you that we will have adequate insurance to compensate us for all losses that result from any insured risks. Any material loss not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We cannot assure you that insurance will be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us or at a cost that will not have a material adverse effect on our profitability, net income and cash flows.The global nature of our operations and assets subjects us to financial and regulatory risks in the countries in which we and our customers, suppliers and other business counterparties operate. We have operations and assets in various parts of the world. In addition, we sell or may in the future sell our products and services to the U.S. and foreign governments and in foreign countries. As a global business, we are subject to complex laws, regulations and other conditions in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate, and associated risks, including: U.S. imposed embargoes of sales to specific countries; foreign import controls (which may be arbitrarily imposed or enforced); import regulations and duties; export regulations (which require us to comply with stringent licensing regimes); reporting requirements regarding the use of ""conflict"" minerals mined from certain countries; anti-dumping regulations; price and currency controls; exchange rate fluctuations; dividend remittance restrictions; expropriation of assets; war, civil uprisings and riots; government instability; government-imposed economic uncertainties, such as a prolonged U.S. federal government shutdown; government contracting requirements including cost accounting standards, including various procurement, security, and audit requirements, as well as requirements to certify to the government compliance with these requirements; the necessity of obtaining governmental approval for new and continuing products and operations; and legal systems or decrees, laws, taxes, regulations, interpretations and court decisions that are not always fully developed and that may be retroactively or arbitrarily applied. We have experienced inadvertent violations of some of these regulations, including export regulations, safety and environmental regulations, and regulations prohibiting sales of certain products, in the past, none of which has had or, we believe, will have a  5Table of Contentsmaterial adverse effect on our business. However, any significant violations of these or other regulations in the future could result in civil or criminal sanctions, and the loss of export or other licenses which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are subject to state unclaimed property laws in the ordinary course of business, and are currently undergoing a multi-state unclaimed property audit, the timing and outcome of which cannot be specifically predicted, and we may incur significant professional fees in conjunction with the audit. We may also be subject to unanticipated income taxes, excise duties, import taxes, export taxes, value added taxes, or other governmental assessments, and taxes may be impacted by changes in legislation in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, our organizational and capital structure may limit our ability to transfer funds between countries without incurring adverse tax consequences. Any of these events could result in a loss of business or other unexpected costs that could reduce sales or profits and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our results could be impacted by changes in tariffs, trade agreements or other trade restrictions imposed oragreed to by the U.S. or foreign governments. Under the current presidential administration, the U.S. government hasindicated its intent to alter its approach to international trade policy and in some cases to renegotiate, or potentiallyterminate, certain existing bilateral or multi-lateral trade agreements and treaties with foreign countries, including the NorthAmerican Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”). For example, on September 30, 2018, the U.S., Mexico, and Canadareached a preliminary U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (“USMCA”) which, if finalized and approved by relevantgovernmental bodies in each participating country, would replace NAFTA. In addition, the U.S. government has recentlyimposed certain tariffs and is considering imposing further tariffs on certain foreign goods, including steel. Meanwhile,certain foreign governments, including the government of the People’s Republic of China, have imposed or are consideringimposing tariffs on certain U.S. goods. It remains unclear what the U.S. federal government or foreign governments will orwill not do in the future with respect to tariffs, NAFTA or other international trade agreements and policies. An escalatingtrade war or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies has the potential toadversely impact demand for our products, our costs, customers, suppliers and/or the U.S. or foreign economies or certainsectors thereof in which we compete and, thus, to adversely impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operationsand cash flows.Any disruption or failure in the operation of our information systems, including from conversions or integrations of information technology or reporting systems, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our information technology (""IT"") systems are an integral part of our business. We depend upon our IT systems to help communicate internally and externally, process orders, manage inventory, make payments and collect accounts receivable. Our IT systems also allow us to purchase, sell and ship products efficiently and on a timely basis, to maintain cost-effective operations, and to help provide superior service to our customers. We are currently in the process of implementing enterprise resource planning (""ERP"") platforms across certain of our businesses, and we expect that we will need to continue to improve and further integrate our IT systems, on an ongoing basis in order to effectively run our business. If we fail to successfully manage and integrate our IT systems, including these ERP platforms, it could adversely affect our business or operating results.Increased cybersecurity requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, data and services and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In the ordinary course of our business, we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our business operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen.  Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations, and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position. For instance, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which took effect in May 2018, among other things, mandates new requirements regarding the handling of personal data of employees and customers, including its use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. If we fail to comply with these laws or regulations, we could be subject to significant litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions or fines in one or more jurisdictions. A failure to comply with the GDPR could potentially result in fines up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues.We have significant indebtedness that could affect our operations and financial condition, and our failure to meet certain financial covenants required by our debt agreements may materially and adversely affect our assets, financial position and cash flows. At December 31, 2018, we had consolidated debt obligations of $944.0 million, representing  6Table of Contentsapproximately 44% of our total capital (indebtedness plus stockholders’ equity) as of that date. Our level of indebtedness, proportion of variable rate debt obligations and the significant debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness may adversely affect our operations and financial condition. For example, our indebtedness could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, investments in technology and research and development, acquisitions, dividends and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industries in which we compete; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors, some of whom have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources than we do; limit our ability to borrow additional funds; or increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. In addition, a majority of our debt arrangements require us to maintain certain debt and interest coverage ratios and limit our ability to incur debt, make investments or undertake certain other business activities. These requirements could limit our ability to obtain future financing and may prevent us from taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. Our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our debt arrangements may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the restrictions could result in an event of default under our debt arrangements which, in turn, could result in an event of default under the terms of our other indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our debt arrangements, after the expiration of any grace periods, our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our debt arrangements, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to happen, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the payments due under those arrangements or our other indebtedness or that we could find alternative financing to replace that indebtedness.Conditions in the worldwide credit markets may limit our ability to expand our credit lines beyond current bank commitments.  In addition, our profitability may be adversely affected as a result of increases in interest rates. At December 31, 2018, we and our subsidiaries had $944.0 million aggregate principal amount of consolidated debt obligations outstanding, of which approximately 78% had interest rates that float with the market (not hedged against interest rate fluctuations). A 100 basis point increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in effect at December 31, 2018 would result in an approximate $7.3 million annualized increase in interest expense.Changes in the availability or price of materials, products and energy resources could adversely affect our costs and profitability. We may be adversely affected by the availability or price of raw materials, products and energy resources, particularly related to certain manufacturing operations that utilize steel, stainless steel, titanium, Inconel, Hastelloys and other specialty materials. The availability and price of raw materials and energy resources may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, new laws or regulations, global economic or political events including strikes, terrorist attacks and war, suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. In some instances there are limited sources for raw materials and a limited number of primary suppliers for some of our products for resale. Although we are not dependent upon any single source for any of our principal raw materials or products for resale, and such materials and products have, historically, been readily available, we cannot assure you that such raw materials and products will continue to be readily available. Disruption in the supply of raw materials, products or energy resources or our inability to come to favorable agreements with our suppliers could impair our ability to manufacture, sell and deliver our products and require us to pay higher prices. Any increase in prices for such raw materials, products or energy resources could materially adversely affect our costs and our profitability.  We maintain pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the U.S. and certain international locations. Our costs of providing defined benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on the plans’ assets, interest rates, exchange rate fluctuations, future governmental regulation, global fixed income and equity prices, and our required and/or voluntary contributions to the plans. Declines in the stock market, prevailing interest rates, declines in discount rates, improvements in mortality rates and rising medical costs may cause an increase in our pension and other postretirement benefit expenses in the future and result in reductions in our pension fund asset values and increases in our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. These changes have caused and may continue to cause a significant reduction in our net worth and without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans’ assets, and depending upon the other factors listed above, we could be required to increase funding for some or all of these pension and postretirement plans. We carry significant inventories and a loss in net realizable value could cause a decline in our net worth. At December 31, 2018, our inventories totaled $266.0 million. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value based on management's judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels, quantities and prices at which such inventories will be sold in the normal course of business. Accelerating the disposal process or changes in estimates of future sales potential may necessitate future reduction to inventory values. See “Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies”.   7Table of ContentsWe have significant goodwill and an impairment of our goodwill could cause a decline in our net worth. Our total assets include substantial goodwill. At December 31, 2018, our goodwill totaled $955.5 million. The goodwill results from our prior acquisitions, representing the excess of the purchase price we paid over the net assets of the companies acquired. We assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill during each calendar year or sooner if triggering events warrant. If future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units does not meet expectations or fair values fall due to significant stock market declines, we may be required to reflect a non-cash charge to operating results for goodwill impairment. The recognition of an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material. See “Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies”.  We may not realize all of the sales expected from our existing backlog or anticipated orders. At December 31, 2018, we had $1,169.2 million of order backlog, the majority of which related to aerospace OEM customers. There can be no assurances that the revenues projected in our backlog will be realized or, if realized, will result in profits. We consider backlog to be firm customer orders for future delivery. OEM customers may provide projections of components and assemblies that they anticipate purchasing in the future under existing programs. These projections may represent orders that are beyond lead time and are included in backlog when supported by a long term agreement. Our customers may have the right under certain circumstances or with certain penalties or consequences to terminate, reduce or defer firm orders that we have in backlog. If our customers terminate, reduce or defer firm orders, we may be protected from certain costs and losses, but our sales will nevertheless be adversely affected. Although we strive to maintain ongoing relationships with our customers, there is an ongoing risk that orders may be canceled or rescheduled due to fluctuations in our customers’ business needs or purchasing budgets.  Also, our realization of sales from new and existing programs is inherently subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties, including whether our customers execute the launch of product programs on time, or at all, the number of units that our customers actually produce, the timing of production and manufacturing insourcing decisions made by our customers. In addition, until firm orders are placed, our customers may have the right to discontinue a program or replace us with another supplier at any time without penalty. Our failure to realize sales from new and existing programs could have a material adverse effect on our net sales, results of operations and cash flows.We may not recover all of our up-front costs related to new or existing programs. New programs may require significant up-front investments for capital equipment, engineering, inventory, design and tooling. As OEMs in the transportation and aerospace industries have looked to suppliers to bear increasing responsibility for the design, engineering and manufacture of systems and components, they have increasingly shifted the financial risk associated with those responsibilities to the suppliers as well. This trend may continue and is most evident in the area of engineering cost reimbursement. We cannot assure you that we will have adequate funds to make such up-front investments or to recover such costs from our customers as part of our product pricing. In the event that we are unable to make such investments, or to recover them through sales or direct reimbursement from our customers, our profitability, liquidity and cash flows may be adversely affected. In addition, we incur costs and make capital expenditures for new program awards based upon certain estimates of production volumes and production complexity. While we attempt to recover such costs and capital expenditures by appropriately pricing our products, the prices of our products are based in part upon planned production volumes. If the actual production is significantly less than planned or significantly more complex than anticipated, we may be unable to recover such costs. In addition, because a significant portion of our overall costs is fixed, declines in our customers’ production levels can adversely affect the level of our reported profits even if our up-front investments are recovered. We may not realize all of the intangible assets related to the Aerospace aftermarket businesses. We participate in aftermarket Revenue Sharing Programs (""RSPs"") under which we receive an exclusive right to supply designated aftermarket parts over the life of the related aircraft engine program to our customer, General Electric (""GE""). As consideration, we pay participation fees, which are recorded as intangible assets and are recognized as a reduction of sales over the estimated life of the related engine programs. Our total investments in participation fees under our RSPs as of December 31, 2018 equaled $299.5 million, all of which have been paid. At December 31, 2018, the remaining unamortized balance of these participation fees was $177.5 million. We entered into Component Repair Programs (""CRPs""), also with GE, during 2015, 2014 and 2013. The CRPs provide for, among other items, the right to sell certain aftermarket component repair services for CFM56, CF6, CF34 and LM engines directly to other customers over the life of the aircraft engine program as one of a few GE licensed suppliers. In addition, the CRPs extended certain contracts under which the Company currently provides these services directly to GE. Our total investments in CRPs as of December 31, 2018 equaled $111.8 million, all of which have been paid. At December 31, 2018, the remaining unamortized balance the CRPs was $89.9 million. We recorded the CRP payments as intangible assets which are recognized as a reduction of sales over the remaining useful life of these engine programs. 8Table of ContentsThe realizability of each asset is dependent upon future revenues related to the programs' aftermarket parts and services and is subject to impairment testing if circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. The potential exists that actual revenues will not meet expectations due to a change in market conditions, including, for example, the replacement of older engines with new, more fuel-efficient engines or our ability to maintain market share within the aftermarket business. A shortfall in future revenues may result in the failure to realize the net amount of the investments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, profitability could be impacted by the amortization of the participation fees and licenses, and the expiration of the international tax incentives on these programs. See “Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies”.  We face risks of cost overruns and losses on fixed-price contracts. We sell certain of our products under firm, fixed-price contracts providing for a fixed price for the products regardless of the production or purchase costs incurred by us. The cost of producing products may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, outside processing, overhead and other factors, including manufacturing inefficiencies. Increased production costs may result in cost overruns and losses on contracts. The departure of existing management and key personnel, a shortage of skilled employees or a lack of qualified sales professionals could materially affect our business, operations and prospects. Our executive officers are important to the management and direction of our business. Our future success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain or replace these officers and other key management personnel. Although we believe we will be able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should the need arise, our inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Because of the complex nature of many of our products and services, we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilled workforce, including, for example, our engineering talent. In addition, there are significant costs associated with the hiring and training of sales professionals. We could be adversely affected by a shortage of available skilled employees or the loss of a significant number of our sales professionals. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights effectively or if we are accused of infringing theintellectual parties rights of third parties, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We own or are licensed under various intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks and trade secrets. Our intellectual property rights may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage, and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. In addition, the steps that we have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being improperly disclosed, challenged, invalidated, circumvented or designed-around, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. In some circumstances, enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons, or countries may require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property. We also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, confidential information, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect these intangible assets and will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information. Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage, adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may be the target of enforcement actions by third parties, including aggressive and opportunistic patent enforcement claims by non-practicing entities (so-called “patent trolls”). Regardless of the merit of such claims, responding to and defending against infringement claims can be expensive and time-consuming. If the Company is found to infringe any third-party rights, we could be required to pay substantial damages or we could be enjoined from offering some of our products and services.Any product liability, warranty, contractual or other claims in excess of insurance may adversely affect our financial condition. Our operations expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of our products and the products we buy from third parties and sell to our customers, or to potential warranty, contractual or other claims. For example, we may be exposed to potential liability for personal injury, property damage or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component designed, manufactured or sold by us, or the failure of an aircraft component that has been serviced by us or of the components themselves. While we have liability insurance for certain risks, our insurance may not cover all liabilities, including potential reputational impacts. Additionally, insurance coverage may not be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us. Any material liability not covered by insurance or for which third-party indemnification is not available for the full amount of the loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 9Table of ContentsFrom time to time, we receive product warranty claims, under which we may be required to bear costs of inspection, repair or replacement of certain of our products. Warranty claims may range from individual customer claims to full recalls of all products in the field. We vigorously defend ourselves in connection with these matters. We cannot, however, assure you that the costs, charges and liabilities associated with these matters will not be material, or that those costs, charges and liabilities will not exceed any amounts reserved for them in our Consolidated Financial Statements.  Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted by strikes or work stoppages. Approximately 17% of our U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and more than 46% of our non-U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, trade union agreements, or national industry agreements. The Company has a national collective bargaining agreement (“CBA”) with certain unionized employees at the Bristol, Connecticut and Corry, Pennsylvania facilities of the Associated Spring business unit, covering approximately 300 employees. The current CBA will expire in August 2020, at which time we expect to negotiate a successor agreement. The local CBA for the Corry, Pennsylvania facility of the Associated Spring business unit will expire on May 31, 2019, at which time we expect to negotiate a successor agreement. We also have annual negotiations in Brazil and Mexico and, collectively, these negotiations cover approximately 300 employees in those two countries. We also completed negotiations resulting in wage adjustments at eight locations in our Industrial Segment, collectively, covering a total of approximately 1,400 employees.Although we believe that our relations with our employees are good, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in negotiating new CBAs or that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor, including healthcare, pensions or other benefits. Any potential strikes or work stoppages, and the resulting adverse impact on our relationships with customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Similarly, a protracted strike or work stoppage at any of our major customers, suppliers or other vendors could materially adversely affect our business.Changes in taxation requirements could affect our financial results. Our products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions in which we operate. Increases in indirect taxes could affect our products’ affordability and therefore reduce our sales. We are also subject to income tax in numerous jurisdictions in which we generate revenues. Changes in tax laws, tax rates or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. Among other things, our tax liabilities are affected by the mix of pretax income or loss among the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and the potential repatriation of foreign earnings to the U.S. Further, during the ordinary course of business, we are subject to examination by the various tax authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate which could result in an unanticipated increase in taxes. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”). The Act made broad and complex changes to the U.S. Tax Code that affected 2017, 2018 and future years, including a reduction of the corporate income tax rate, changes to the taxation of foreign unrepatriated earnings, limitations on deduction of interest and compensation expense and the introduction of the global intangible low-taxed income taxes. The changes may impact current and deferred income tax expense and deferred tax balances for U.S operations as well as the potential future repatriation of foreign income.  The Company has made final entries for income tax expense in the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2018. The impact of any proposed regulations related to the Act may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. See “Part II- Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- U.S. Tax Reform”.Changes in accounting guidance could affect our financial results. New accounting guidance that may become applicable to us from time to time, or changes in the interpretations of existing guidance, could have a significant effect on our reported results for the affected periods. Adoption of new accounting guidance could have a material impact on our financial statements and may retroactively affect the accounting treatment of transactions completed before adoption. See Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.RISKS RELATED TO THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE We operate in highly competitive markets. We may not be able to compete effectively with our competitors, and competitive pressures could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our two global business segments compete with a number of larger and smaller companies in the markets we serve. Some of our competitors have greater financial, production, research and development, or other resources than we do. Within Aerospace, certain of our OEM customers compete with our repair and overhaul business. Some of our OEM customers in the aerospace industry also compete with us where they have the ability to manufacture the components and assemblies that we supply to them but have chosen, for capacity limitations, cost considerations or other reasons, to outsource the manufacturing to us. Our customers award business based on, among other things, price, quality, reliability of supply, service, technology and design. Our competitors’ efforts to grow market share could exert downward pressure on our product pricing and margins. Our competitors may also develop products or services, or methods of delivering those products or services that are superior to our products,  10Table of Contentsservices or methods. Our competitors may adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with our existing or future competitors. Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in part, on our ability to continue make investments to innovate and manufacture the types of products demanded by our customers, and to reduce costs by such means as reducing excess capacity, leveraging global purchasing, improving productivity, eliminating redundancies and increasing production in low-cost countries. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, in increasing our manufacturing footprint in low-cost countries. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or that we will be successful in maintaining our competitive position. If we are unable to differentiate our products or maintain a low-cost footprint, we may lose market share or be forced to reduce prices, thereby lowering our margins. Any such occurrences could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The industries in which we operate have been experiencing consolidation, both in our suppliers and the customers we serve. Supplier consolidation is in part attributable to OEMs more frequently awarding long-term sole source or preferred supplier contracts to the most capable suppliers in an effort to reduce the total number of suppliers from whom components and systems are purchased. If consolidation of our existing competitors occurs, we would expect the competitive pressures we face to increase, and we cannot assure you that our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows will not be adversely impacted as a result of consolidation by our competitors or customers.Original equipment manufacturers in the aerospace and transportation industries have significant pricing leverage over suppliers and may be able to achieve price reductions over time. Additionally, we may not be successful in our efforts to raise prices on our customers. There is substantial and continuing pressure from OEMs in the transportation industries, including automotive and aerospace, to reduce the prices they pay to suppliers. We attempt to manage such downward pricing pressure, while trying to preserve our business relationships with our customers, by seeking to reduce our production costs through various measures, including purchasing raw materials and components at lower prices and implementing cost-effective process improvements. Our suppliers have periodically resisted, and in the future may resist, pressure to lower their prices and may seek to impose price increases. If we are unable to offset OEM price reductions, our profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, OEMs have substantial leverage in setting purchasing and payment terms, including the terms of accelerated payment programs under which payments are made prior to the account due date in return for an early payment discount. OEMs can unexpectedly change their purchasing policies or payment practices, which could have a negative impact on our short-term working capital.  Demand for our defense-related products depends on government spending. A portion of Aerospace's sales is derived from the military market, including single-sourced and dual-sourced sales. The military market is largely dependent upon government budgets and is subject to governmental appropriations. Although multi-year contracts may be authorized in connection with major procurements, funds are generally appropriated on a fiscal year basis even though a program may be expected to continue for several years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded and additional funds are committed only as further appropriations are made. We cannot assure you that maintenance of or increases in defense spending will be allocated to programs that would benefit our business. Moreover, we cannot assure you that new military aircraft programs in which we participate will enter full-scale production as expected. A decrease in levels of defense spending or the government’s termination of, or failure to fully fund, one or more of the contracts for the programs in which we participate could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.The aerospace industry is highly regulated. Complications related to aerospace regulations may adversely affect the Company. A substantial portion of our income is derived from our aerospace businesses. The aerospace industry is highly regulated in the U.S. by the Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, and in other countries by similar regulatory agencies. We must be certified by these agencies and, in some cases, by individual OEMs in order to engineer and service systems and components used in specific aircraft models. If material authorizations or approvals were delayed, revoked or suspended, our business could be adversely affected. New or more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted, or industry oversight heightened, in the future, and we may incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or any heightened industry oversight. Fluctuations in jet fuel and other energy prices may impact our operating results. Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of operating expenses for companies in the aerospace industry. Fluctuations in fuel costs could impact levels and frequency of aircraft maintenance and overhaul activities, and airlines' decisions on maintaining, deferring or canceling new aircraft purchases, in part based on the value associated with new fuel efficient technologies. Widespread disruption to oil production, refinery operations and pipeline capacity in certain areas of the U.S. can impact the price of jet fuel significantly. Conflicts in the Middle East, an important source of oil for the U.S. and other countries where we do business, cause prices for fuel to be volatile. Because we and many of our customers are in the aerospace industry, these fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  11Table of ContentsOur products and services may be rendered obsolete by new products, technologies and processes. Our manufacturing operations focus on highly engineered components which require extensive engineering and research and development time. Our competitive advantage may be adversely impacted if we cannot continue to introduce new products ahead of our competition, or if our products are rendered obsolete by other products or by new, different technologies and processes. The success of our new products will depend on a number of factors, including innovation, customer acceptance, the efficiency of our suppliers in providing materials and component parts, and the performance and quality of our products relative to those of our competitors. We cannot predict the level of market acceptance or the amount of market share our new products will achieve. Additionally, we may face increased or unexpected costs associated with new product introduction, including the use of additional resources such as personnel and capital. We cannot assure that we will not experience new product introduction delays in the future. RISKS RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING, ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES AND DIVESTITURES Our restructuring actions could have long-term adverse effects on our business. From time to time, we have implemented restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future. We may not achieve expected cost savings from workforce reductions or restructuring activities and actual charges, costs and adjustments due to these actions may vary materially from our estimates. Our ability to realize anticipated cost savings, synergies and revenue enhancements may be affected by a number of factors, including the following: our ability to effectively eliminate duplicative back office overhead and overlapping sales personnel, rationalize manufacturing capacity, synchronize information technology systems, consolidate warehousing and other facilities and shift production to more economical facilities; significant cash and non-cash integration and implementation costs or charges in order to achieve those cost savings, which could offset any such savings and other synergies resulting from our acquisitions or divestitures; and our ability to avoid labor disruption in connection with these activities. In addition, delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements may diminish the expected operational or financial benefits. See Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.    Our acquisition and other strategic initiatives may not be successful. We have made a number of acquisitions in the past, including most recently the acquisitions of the Gimatic and IGS businesses, and we anticipate that we may, from time to time, acquire additional businesses, assets or securities of companies, and enter into joint ventures and other strategic relationships that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our businesses. These activities expose the Company to a number of risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of any of which could materially adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. A portion of the industries that we serve are mature industries. As a result, our future growth may depend in part on the successful acquisition and integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations. We may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions, obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms, obtain regulatory approvals or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future. We could have difficulties integrating acquired businesses with our existing operations. Difficulties of integration can include coordinating and consolidating separate systems, integrating the management of the acquired business, retaining market acceptance of acquired products and services, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees, and implementing our enterprise resource planning systems and operational procedures and disciplines. Any such difficulties may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with employees, customers, business partners and suppliers. In addition, even if integration is successful, the financial performance of acquired business may not be as expected and there can be no assurance we will realize anticipated benefits from our acquisitions. We cannot assure you that we will effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business or product offerings or realize anticipated operational synergies. In connection with the integration of acquired operations or the conduct of our overall business strategies, we may periodically restructure our businesses and/or sell assets or portions of our business. Integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies into our existing operations may result in difficulties, significant expense and accounting charges, disrupt our business or divert management’s time and attention.Acquisitions involve numerous other risks, including potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business. Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired businesses require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the business operations before we acquired it. However, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial condition. In connection with acquisitions or joint venture investments outside the U.S., we may enter into derivative contracts to purchase foreign currency in order to hedge against the risk of foreign currency fluctuations in connection with such acquisitions or joint venture investments, which subjects us to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations associated with such derivative contracts. Additionally, our final  12Table of Contentsdeterminations and appraisals of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions may vary materially from earlier estimates. We cannot assure you that the fair value of acquired businesses will remain constant.We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment, and we cannot be certain that our business, operating results and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected. A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to any purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to retain, reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business, and collect the proceeds from any divestitures. In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other products offered by us. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of any divestiture transaction, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. In addition, divestitures of businesses involve a number of risks, including significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships, and a decrease in revenues and earnings associated with the divested business. Furthermore, divestitures potentially involve significant post-closing separation activities, which could involve the expenditure of material financial resources and significant employee resources. Any divestiture may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the dilutive impact from the loss of revenue associated with the divestiture, as well as significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition"
18,B,BARNES GROUP INC,2018-02-20,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks. Please note that additional risks not presently known to us may also materially impact our business and operations. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS We depend on revenues and earnings from a small number of significant customers. Any bankruptcy of or loss of or, cancellation, reduction or delay in purchases by these customers could harm our business. In 2017, our net sales to General Electric and its subsidiaries accounted for 18% of our total sales and approximately 55% of Aerospace's net sales. Aerospace's second and third largest customers, Rolls-Royce and United Technologies Corporation and their subsidiaries, accounted for 15% and 10%, respectively, of Aerospace's net sales in 2017. Approximately 6% of Aerospace's net sales in 2017 were to its next three largest customers. Approximately 9% of Industrial's sales in 2017 were to its three largest customers. Some of our success will depend on the business strength and viability of those customers. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our largest customers. Some of our customers may in the future reduce their purchases due to economic conditions or shift their purchases from us to our competitors, in-house or to other sources. Some of our long-term sales agreements provide that until a firm order is placed by a customer for a particular product, the customer may unilaterally reduce or discontinue its projected purchases without penalty, or terminate for convenience. The loss of one or more of our largest  4Table of Contentscustomers, any reduction, cancellation or delay in sales to these customers (including a reduction in aftermarket volume in our RSPs), our inability to successfully develop relationships with new customers, or future price concessions we make to retain customers could significantly reduce our sales and profitability. The global nature of our business exposes us to foreign currency fluctuations that may affect our future revenues, debt levels and profitability. We have manufacturing facilities and technical service, sales and distribution centers around the world, and the majority of our foreign operations use the local currency as their functional currency. These include, among others, the Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, Euro, Japanese yen, Korean won, Malaysian ringgit, Mexican peso, Singapore dollar, Swedish krona, Swiss franc and Thai baht. Since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies expose us to translation risk when the local currency financial statements are translated to U.S. dollars. Changes in currency exchange rates may also expose us to transaction risk. We may buy hedges in certain currencies to reduce or offset our exposure to currency exchange fluctuations; however, these transactions may not be adequate or effective to protect us from the exposure for which they are purchased. We have not engaged in any speculative hedging activities. Currency fluctuations may adversely impact our revenues and profitability in the future.Our operations depend on our manufacturing, sales, and service facilities and information systems in various parts of the world which are subject to physical, financial, regulatory, environmental, operational and other risks that could disrupt our operations. We have a significant number of manufacturing facilities, technical service, and sales centers both within and outside the U.S. The global scope of our business subjects us to increased risks and uncertainties such as threats of war, terrorism and instability of governments; and economic, regulatory and legal systems in countries in which we or our customers conduct business. Customer, supplier and our facilities are located in areas that may be affected by natural disasters, including earthquakes, windstorms and floods, which could cause significant damage and disruption to the operations of those facilities and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, some of our manufacturing equipment and tooling is custom-made and is not readily replaceable. Loss of such equipment or tooling could have a negative impact on our manufacturing business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Although we have obtained property damage and business interruption insurance, a major catastrophe such as an earthquake, windstorm, flood or other natural disaster at any of our sites, or significant labor strikes, work stoppages, political unrest, or any of the events described above, in any of the areas where we conduct operations could result in a prolonged interruption of our business. Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in the manufacture or shipment of products or the provision of repair and other services that may result in our loss of sales and customers. Our insurance will not cover all potential risks, and we cannot assure you that we will have adequate insurance to compensate us for all losses that result from any insured risks. Any material loss not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We cannot assure you that insurance will be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us or at a cost that will not have a material adverse effect on our profitability, net income and cash flows.The global nature of our operations and assets subject us to additional financial and regulatory risks. We have operations and assets in various parts of the world. In addition, we sell or may in the future sell our products and services to the U.S. and foreign governments and in foreign countries. As a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate, and associated risks, including: U.S. imposed embargoes of sales to specific countries; foreign import controls (which may be arbitrarily imposed or enforced); import regulations and duties; export regulations (which require us to comply with stringent licensing regimes); reporting requirements regarding the use of ""conflict"" minerals mined from certain countries; anti-dumping regulations; price and currency controls; exchange rate fluctuations; dividend remittance restrictions; expropriation of assets; war, civil uprisings and riots; government instability; government contracting requirements including cost accounting standards, including various procurement, security, and audit requirements, as well as requirements to certify to the government compliance with these requirements; the necessity of obtaining governmental approval for new and continuing products and operations; and legal systems or decrees, laws, taxes, regulations, interpretations and court decisions that are not always fully developed and that may be retroactively or arbitrarily applied. We have experienced inadvertent violations of some of these regulations, including export regulations, safety and environmental regulations, regulations prohibiting sales of certain products and product labeling regulations, in the past, none of which has had or, we believe, will have a material adverse effect on our business. However, any significant violations of these or other regulations in the future could result in civil or criminal sanctions, and the loss of export or other licenses which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are subject to state unclaimed property laws in the ordinary course of business, and are currently undergoing a multi-state unclaimed property audit, the timing and outcome of which cannot be predicted, and we may incur significant professional fees in conjunction with the audit. We may also be subject to unanticipated income taxes, excise duties, import taxes, export taxes, value added taxes, or other governmental assessments, and taxes may be  5Table of Contentsimpacted by changes in legislation in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, our organizational and capital structure may limit our ability to transfer funds between countries without incurring adverse tax consequences. Any of these events could result in a loss of business or other unexpected costs that could reduce sales or profits and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Any disruption or failure in the operation of our information systems, including from conversions or integrations of information technology or reporting systems, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our information technology (""IT"") systems are an integral part of our business. We depend upon our IT systems to help communicate internally and externally, process orders, manage inventory, make payments and collect accounts receivable. Our IT systems also allow us to purchase, sell and ship products efficiently and on a timely basis, to maintain cost-effective operations, and to help provide superior service to our customers. We are currently in the process of implementing enterprise resource planning (""ERP"") platforms across certain of our businesses, and we expect that we will need to continue to improve and further integrate our IT systems, on an ongoing basis in order to effectively run our business. If we fail to successfully manage and integrate our IT systems, including these ERP platforms, it could adversely affect our business or operating results.Further, in the ordinary course of our business, we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our business operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations, and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position. We have significant indebtedness that could affect our operations and financial condition, and our failure to meet certain financial covenants required by our debt agreements may materially and adversely affect our assets, financial position and cash flows. At December 31, 2017, we had consolidated debt obligations of $532.6 million, representing approximately 30% of our total capital (indebtedness plus stockholders’ equity) as of that date. Our level of indebtedness, proportion of variable rate debt obligations and the significant debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness may adversely affect our operations and financial condition. For example, our indebtedness could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, investments in technology and research and development, acquisitions, dividends and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industries in which we compete; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors, some of whom have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources than we do; limit our ability to borrow additional funds; or increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. In addition, a majority of our debt arrangements require us to maintain certain debt and interest coverage ratios and limit our ability to incur debt, make investments or undertake certain other business activities. These requirements could limit our ability to obtain future financing and may prevent us from taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. Our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our debt arrangements may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the restrictions could result in an event of default under our debt arrangements which, in turn, could result in an event of default under the terms of our other indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our debt arrangements, after the expiration of any grace periods, our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our debt arrangements, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to happen, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the payments due under those arrangements or our other indebtedness or that we could find alternative financing to replace that indebtedness.Conditions in the worldwide credit markets may limit our ability to expand our credit lines beyond current bank commitments.  In addition, our profitability may be adversely affected as a result of increases in interest rates. At December 31, 2017, we and our subsidiaries had $532.6 million aggregate principal amount of consolidated debt obligations outstanding, of which approximately 61% had interest rates that float with the market (not hedged against interest rate fluctuations). A 100 basis point increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in effect at December 31, 2017 would result in an approximate $3.2 million annualized increase in interest expense.Changes in the availability or price of materials, products and energy resources could adversely affect our costs and profitability. We may be adversely affected by the availability or price of raw materials, products and energy resources, particularly related to certain manufacturing operations that utilize steel, stainless steel, titanium, Inconel, Hastelloys and other  6Table of Contentsspecialty materials. The availability and price of raw materials and energy resources may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, new laws or regulations, global economic or political events including strikes, terrorist attacks and war, suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. In some instances there are limited sources for raw materials and a limited number of primary suppliers for some of our products for resale. Although we are not dependent upon any single source for any of our principal raw materials or products for resale, and such materials and products have, historically, been readily available, we cannot assure you that such raw materials and products will continue to be readily available. Disruption in the supply of raw materials, products or energy resources or our inability to come to favorable agreements with our suppliers could impair our ability to manufacture, sell and deliver our products and require us to pay higher prices. Any increase in prices for such raw materials, products or energy resources could materially adversely affect our costs and our profitability.  We maintain pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the U.S. and certain international locations. Our costs of providing defined benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on the plans’ assets, exchange rate fluctuations, future governmental regulation, global fixed income and equity prices, and our required and/or voluntary contributions to the plans. Declines in the stock market, prevailing interest rates, declines in discount rates, improvements in mortality rates and rising medical costs may cause an increase in our pension and other postretirement benefit expenses in the future and result in reductions in our pension fund asset values and increases in our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. These changes have caused and may continue to cause a significant reduction in our net worth and without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans’ assets, and depending upon the other factors listed above, we could be required to increase funding for some or all of these pension and postretirement plans. We carry significant inventories and a loss in net realizable value could cause a decline in our net worth. At December 31, 2017, our inventories totaled $242.0 million. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value based on management's judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels, quantities and prices at which such inventories will be sold in the normal course of business. Accelerating the disposal process or incorrect estimates of future sales potential may necessitate future reduction to inventory values. See “Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies”.  We have significant goodwill and an impairment of our goodwill could cause a decline in our net worth. Our total assets include substantial goodwill. At December 31, 2017, our goodwill totaled $690.2 million. The goodwill results from our prior acquisitions, representing the excess of the purchase price we paid over the net assets of the companies acquired. We assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill during each calendar year or sooner if triggering events warrant. If future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units does not meet expectations or fair values fall due to significant stock market declines, we may be required to reflect a non-cash charge to operating results for goodwill impairment. The recognition of an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material. See “Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies”.  We may not realize all of the sales expected from our existing backlog or anticipated orders. At December 31, 2017, we had $1,039.0 million of order backlog, the majority of which related to aerospace OEM customers. There can be no assurances that the revenues projected in our backlog will be realized or, if realized, will result in profits. We consider backlog to be firm customer orders for future delivery. OEM customers may provide projections of components and assemblies that they anticipate purchasing in the future under existing programs. These projections may represent orders that are beyond lead time and are included in backlog when supported by a long term agreement. Our customers may have the right under certain circumstances or with certain penalties or consequences to terminate, reduce or defer firm orders that we have in backlog. If our customers terminate, reduce or defer firm orders, we may be protected from certain costs and losses, but our sales will nevertheless be adversely affected. Although we strive to maintain ongoing relationships with our customers, there is an ongoing risk that orders may be canceled or rescheduled due to fluctuations in our customers’ business needs or purchasing budgets.  Also, our realization of sales from new and existing programs is inherently subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties, including whether our customers execute the launch of product programs on time, or at all, the number of units that our customers actually produce, the timing of production and manufacturing insourcing decisions made by our customers. In addition, until firm orders are placed, our customers may have the right to discontinue a program or replace us with another supplier at any time without penalty. Our failure to realize sales from new and existing programs could have a material adverse effect on our net sales, results of operations and cash flows. 7Table of ContentsWe may not recover all of our up-front costs related to new or existing programs. New programs may require significant up-front investments for capital equipment, engineering, inventory, design and tooling. As OEMs in the transportation and aerospace industries have looked to suppliers to bear increasing responsibility for the design, engineering and manufacture of systems and components, they have increasingly shifted the financial risk associated with those responsibilities to the suppliers as well. This trend may continue and is most evident in the area of engineering cost reimbursement. We cannot assure you that we will have adequate funds to make such up-front investments or to recover such costs from our customers as part of our product pricing. In the event that we are unable to make such investments, or to recover them through sales or direct reimbursement from our customers, our profitability, liquidity and cash flows may be adversely affected. In addition, we incur costs and make capital expenditures for new program awards based upon certain estimates of production volumes and production complexity. While we attempt to recover such costs and capital expenditures by appropriately pricing our products, the prices of our products are based in part upon planned production volumes. If the actual production is significantly less than planned or significantly more complex than anticipated, we may be unable to recover such costs. In addition, because a significant portion of our overall costs is fixed, declines in our customers’ production levels can adversely affect the level of our reported profits even if our up-front investments are recovered. We may not realize all of the intangible assets related to the Aerospace aftermarket businesses. We participate in aftermarket Revenue Sharing Programs (""RSPs"") under which we receive an exclusive right to supply designated aftermarket parts over the life of the related aircraft engine program to our customer, General Electric (""GE""). As consideration, we pay participation fees, which are recorded as intangible assets and are recognized as a reduction of sales over the estimated life of the related engine programs. Our total investments in participation fees under our RSPs as of December 31, 2017 equaled $293.7 million, all of which have been paid. At December 31, 2017, the remaining unamortized balance of these participation fees was $185.6 million. We entered into Component Repair Programs (""CRPs""), also with GE, during 2015, 2014 and 2013. The CRPs provide for, among other items, the right to sell certain aftermarket component repair services for CFM56, CF6, CF34 and LM engines directly to other customers over the life of the aircraft engine program as one of a few GE licensed suppliers. In addition, the CRPs extended certain contracts under which the Company currently provides these services directly to GE. Our total investments in CRPs as of December 31, 2017 equaled $111.8 million, all of which have been paid. At December 31, 2017, the remaining unamortized balance the CRPs was $95.3 million. We recorded the CRP payments as an intangible asset which is recognized as a reduction of sales over the remaining useful life of these engine programs.The realizability of each asset is dependent upon future revenues related to the programs' aftermarket parts and services and is subject to impairment testing if circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. The potential exists that actual revenues will not meet expectations due to a change in market conditions, including, for example, the replacement of older engines with new, more fuel-efficient engines or our ability to maintain market share within the aftermarket business. A shortfall in future revenues may result in the failure to realize the net amount of the investments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, profitability could be impacted by the amortization of the participation fees and licenses, and the expiration of the international tax incentives on these programs. See “Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies”.  We face risks of cost overruns and losses on fixed-price contracts. We sell certain of our products under firm, fixed-price contracts providing for a fixed price for the products regardless of the production or purchase costs incurred by us. The cost of producing products may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, outside processing, overhead and other factors, including manufacturing inefficiencies. Increased production costs may result in cost overruns and losses on contracts. The departure of existing management and key personnel, a shortage of skilled employees or a lack of qualified sales professionals could materially affect our business, operations and prospects. Our executive officers are important to the management and direction of our business. Our future success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain or replace these officers and other key management personnel. Although we believe we will be able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should the need arise, our inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Because of the complex nature of many of our products and services, we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilled workforce, including, for example, our engineering talent. In addition, there are significant costs associated with the hiring and training of sales professionals. We could be adversely affected by a shortage of available skilled employees or the loss of a significant number of our sales professionals. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights effectively, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We own or are licensed under various intellectual property rights, including patents,  8Table of Contentstrademarks and trade secrets. Our intellectual property rights may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage, and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. In addition, the steps that we have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being improperly disclosed, challenged, invalidated, circumvented or designed-around, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. In some circumstances, enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons, or countries may require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property. We also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, confidential information, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect these intangible assets and will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information. Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage, adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position, financial condition and results of operations.Any product liability, warranty, contractual or other claims in excess of insurance may adversely affect our financial condition. Our operations expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of our products and the products we buy from third parties and sell to our customers, or to potential warranty, contractual or other claims. For example, we may be exposed to potential liability for personal injury, property damage or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component designed, manufactured or sold by us, or the failure of an aircraft component that has been serviced by us or of the components themselves. While we have liability insurance for certain risks, our insurance may not cover all liabilities, including potential reputational impacts. Additionally, insurance coverage may not be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us. Any material liability not covered by insurance or for which third-party indemnification is not available for the full amount of the loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.From time to time, we receive product warranty claims, under which we may be required to bear costs of inspection, repair or replacement of certain of our products. Warranty claims may range from individual customer claims to full recalls of all products in the field. We vigorously defend ourselves in connection with these matters. We cannot, however, assure you that the costs, charges and liabilities associated with these matters will not be material, or that those costs, charges and liabilities will not exceed any amounts reserved for them in our consolidated financial statements.  Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted by strikes or work stoppages. Approximately 17% of our U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and more than 39% of our non-U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or statutory trade union agreements. The Company has a national collective bargaining agreement (“CBA”) with certain unionized employees at the Bristol, Connecticut and Corry, Pennsylvania facilities of the Associated Spring business unit, covering approximately 300 employees. The current CBA will expire in August 2020, at which time we expect to negotiate a successor agreement. The local CBA for the Corry, Pennsylvania facility of the Associated Spring business unit will expire on June 14, 2018, and the local CBA for the Bristol, Connecticut facility of the Associated Spring business unit will expire on October 15, 2018, at which time we expect to negotiate successor agreements. We also have annual negotiations in Brazil and Mexico and, collectively, these negotiations cover approximately 300 employees in those two countries. In addition, we expect to negotiate a successor agreement to the local CBA covering approximately 250 employees in Singapore which will expire at the end of 2018.  We also completed negotiations resulting in wage adjustments at four locations in our Industrial Segment, collectively, covering a total of approximately 750 employees.  Although we believe that our relations with our employees are good, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in negotiating new CBAs or that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor, including healthcare, pensions or other benefits. Any potential strikes or work stoppages, and the resulting adverse impact on our relationships with customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Similarly, a protracted strike or work stoppage at any of our major customers, suppliers or other vendors could materially adversely affect our business.Changes in taxation requirements could affect our financial results. Our products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions in which we operate. Increases in indirect taxes could affect our products’ affordability and therefore reduce our sales. We are also subject to income tax in numerous jurisdictions in which we generate revenues. Changes in tax laws, tax rates or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. Among other things, our tax liabilities are affected by the mix of pretax income or loss among the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and the potential repatriation of foreign earnings to the U.S. Further, during the ordinary course of business, we are subject to examination by the various tax authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate which could result in an  9Table of Contentsunanticipated increase in taxes. On December 22, 2017 the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”). The Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S Tax Code that affect 2017 and that include, but are not limited to, requiring a one-time Transition Tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries of the Company (payable over eight years) and exempting foreign dividends paid to the U.S. during the year from taxation, if such earnings are included with the Transition Tax. The Act also establishes new law that will affect 2018 and beyond, including, but not limited to a reduction of the U.S. Corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and a general elimination of U.S federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries. The Company has recorded a provisional tax expense in the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2017. The Company has not finalized its' accounting for the income tax effects related to certain sections of the Act; however we are permitted to make changes over a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the enactment date of the Act. Such changes may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See “Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - U.S. Tax Reform”.Changes in accounting guidance could affect our financial results. New accounting guidance that may become applicable to us from time to time, or changes in the interpretations of existing guidance, could have a significant effect on our reported results for the affected periods. Adoption of new accounting guidance could have a material impact on our financial statements and may retroactively affect the accounting treatment of transactions completed before adoption. See Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.RISKS RELATED TO THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE We operate in highly competitive markets. We may not be able to compete effectively with our competitors, and competitive pressures could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our two global business segments compete with a number of larger and smaller companies in the markets we serve. Some of our competitors have greater financial, production, research and development, or other resources than we do. Within Aerospace, certain of our OEM customers compete with our repair and overhaul business. Some of our OEM customers in the aerospace industry also compete with us where they have the ability to manufacture the components and assemblies that we supply to them but have chosen, for capacity limitations, cost considerations or other reasons, to outsource the manufacturing to us. Our customers award business based on, among other things, price, quality, reliability of supply, service, technology and design. Our competitors’ efforts to grow market share could exert downward pressure on our product pricing and margins. Our competitors may also develop products or services, or methods of delivering those products or services that are superior to our products, services or methods. Our competitors may adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with our existing or future competitors. Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in part, on our ability to continue make investments to innovate and manufacture the types of products demanded by our customers, and to reduce costs by such means as reducing excess capacity, leveraging global purchasing, improving productivity, eliminating redundancies and increasing production in low-cost countries. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, in increasing our manufacturing footprint in low-cost countries. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or that we will be successful in maintaining our competitive position. If we are unable to differentiate our products or maintain a low-cost footprint, we may lose market share or be forced to reduce prices, thereby lowering our margins. Any such occurrences could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The industries in which we operate have been experiencing consolidation, both in our suppliers and the customers we serve. Supplier consolidation is in part attributable to OEMs more frequently awarding long-term sole source or preferred supplier contracts to the most capable suppliers in an effort to reduce the total number of suppliers from whom components and systems are purchased. If consolidation of our existing competitors occurs, we would expect the competitive pressures we face to increase, and we cannot assure you that our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows will not be adversely impacted as a result of consolidation by our competitors or customers.Original equipment manufacturers in the aerospace and transportation industries have significant pricing leverage over suppliers and may be able to achieve price reductions over time. Additionally, we may not be successful in our efforts to raise prices on our customers. There is substantial and continuing pressure from OEMs in the transportation industries, including automotive and aerospace, to reduce the prices they pay to suppliers. We attempt to manage such downward pricing pressure, while trying to preserve our business relationships with our customers, by seeking to reduce our production costs through various measures, including purchasing raw materials and components at lower prices and implementing cost-effective process improvements. Our suppliers have periodically resisted, and in the future may resist, pressure to lower their prices and may seek to impose price increases. If we are unable to offset OEM price reductions, our profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, OEMs have substantial leverage in setting purchasing and payment terms, including the terms of accelerated payment programs under which payments are made prior to the account due  10Table of Contentsdate in return for an early payment discount. OEMs can unexpectedly change their purchasing policies or payment practices, which could have a negative impact on our short-term working capital. Demand for our defense-related products depends on government spending. A portion of Aerospace's sales is derived from the military market, including single-sourced and dual-sourced sales. The military market is largely dependent upon government budgets and is subject to governmental appropriations. Although multi-year contracts may be authorized in connection with major procurements, funds are generally appropriated on a fiscal year basis even though a program may be expected to continue for several years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded and additional funds are committed only as further appropriations are made. We cannot assure you that maintenance of or increases in defense spending will be allocated to programs that would benefit our business. Moreover, we cannot assure you that new military aircraft programs in which we participate will enter full-scale production as expected. A decrease in levels of defense spending or the government’s termination of, or failure to fully fund, one or more of the contracts for the programs in which we participate could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. The aerospace industry is highly regulated. Complications related to aerospace regulations may adversely affect the Company. A substantial portion of our income is derived from our aerospace businesses. The aerospace industry is highly regulated in the U.S. by the Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, and in other countries by similar regulatory agencies. We must be certified by these agencies and, in some cases, by individual OEMs in order to engineer and service systems and components used in specific aircraft models. If material authorizations or approvals were delayed, revoked or suspended, our business could be adversely affected. New or more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted, or industry oversight heightened, in the future, and we may incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or any heightened industry oversight. Fluctuations in jet fuel and other energy prices may impact our operating results. Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of operating expenses for companies in the aerospace industry. Fluctuations in fuel costs could impact levels and frequency of aircraft maintenance and overhaul activities, and airlines' decisions on maintaining, deferring or canceling new aircraft purchases, in part based on the value associated with new fuel efficient technologies. Widespread disruption to oil production, refinery operations and pipeline capacity in certain areas of the U.S. can impact the price of jet fuel significantly. Conflicts in the Middle East, an important source of oil for the U.S. and other countries where we do business, cause prices for fuel to be volatile. Because we and many of our customers are in the aerospace industry, these fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Our products and services may be rendered obsolete by new products, technologies and processes. Our manufacturing operations focus on highly engineered components which require extensive engineering and research and development time. Our competitive advantage may be adversely impacted if we cannot continue to introduce new products ahead of our competition, or if our products are rendered obsolete by other products or by new, different technologies and processes. The success of our new products will depend on a number of factors, including innovation, customer acceptance, the efficiency of our suppliers in providing materials and component parts, and the performance and quality of our products relative to those of our competitors. We cannot predict the level of market acceptance or the amount of market share our new products will achieve. Additionally, we may face increased or unexpected costs associated with new product introduction, including the use of additional resources such as personnel and capital. We cannot assure that we will not experience new product introduction delays in the future. RISKS RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING, ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES AND DIVESTITURES Our restructuring actions could have long-term adverse effects on our business. From time to time, we have implemented restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future. We may not achieve expected cost savings from workforce reductions or restructuring activities and actual charges, costs and adjustments due to these actions may vary materially from our estimates. Our ability to realize anticipated cost savings, synergies and revenue enhancements may be affected by a number of factors, including the following: our ability to effectively eliminate duplicative back office overhead and overlapping sales personnel, rationalize manufacturing capacity, synchronize information technology systems, consolidate warehousing and other facilities and shift production to more economical facilities; significant cash and non-cash integration and implementation costs or charges in order to achieve those cost savings, which could offset any such savings and other synergies resulting from our acquisitions or divestitures; and our ability to avoid labor disruption in connection with these activities. In addition, delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements may diminish the expected operational or financial benefits. See Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.     11Table of ContentsOur acquisition and other strategic initiatives may not be successful. We have made a number of acquisitions in the past, including most recently the acquisitions of the Gammaflux and FOBOHA businesses, and we anticipate that we may, from time to time, acquire additional businesses, assets or securities of companies, and enter into joint ventures and other strategic relationships that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our businesses. These activities expose the Company to a number of risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of any of which could materially adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. A portion of the industries that we serve are mature industries. As a result, our future growth may depend in part on the successful acquisition and integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations. We may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions, obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms, obtain regulatory approvals or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future. We could have difficulties integrating acquired businesses with our existing operations. Difficulties of integration can include coordinating and consolidating separate systems, integrating the management of the acquired business, retaining market acceptance of acquired products and services, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees, and implementing our enterprise resource planning systems and operational procedures and disciplines. Any such difficulties may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with employees, customers, business partners and suppliers. In addition, even if integration is successful, the financial performance of acquired business may not be as expected and there can be no assurance we will realize anticipated benefits from our acquisitions. We cannot assure you that we will effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business or product offerings or realize anticipated operational synergies. In connection with the integration of acquired operations or the conduct of our overall business strategies, we may periodically restructure our businesses and/or sell assets or portions of our business. Integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies into our existing operations may result in difficulties, significant expense and accounting charges, disrupt our business or divert management’s time and attention.Acquisitions involve numerous other risks, including potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business. Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired businesses require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the business operations before we acquired it. However, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial condition. In connection with acquisitions or joint venture investments outside the U.S., we may enter into derivative contracts to purchase foreign currency in order to hedge against the risk of foreign currency fluctuations in connection with such acquisitions or joint venture investments, which subjects us to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations associated with such derivative contracts. Additionally, our final determinations and appraisals of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions may vary materially from earlier estimates. We cannot assure you that the fair value of acquired businesses will remain constant.We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment, and we cannot be certain that our business, operating results and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected. A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to any purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to retain, reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business, and collect the proceeds from any divestitures. In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other products offered by us. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of any divestiture transaction, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. In addition, divestitures of businesses involve a number of risks, including significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships, and a decrease in revenues and earnings associated with the divested business. Furthermore, divestitures potentially involve significant post-closing separation activities, which could involve the expenditure of material financial resources and significant employee resources. Any divestiture may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the dilutive impact from the loss of revenue associated with the divestiture, as well as significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition"
11,B,BARNES GROUP INC,2017-02-21,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks. Please note that additional risks not presently known to us may also materially impact our business and operations. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS We depend on revenues and earnings from a small number of significant customers. Any bankruptcy of or loss of or, cancellation, reduction or delay in purchases by these customers could harm our business. In 2016, our net sales to General Electric and its subsidiaries accounted for 17% of our total sales and approximately 51% of Aerospace's net sales. Aerospace's second and third largest customers, Rolls-Royce and United Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries, accounted for 13% and 11%, respectively, of Aerospace net sales in 2016. Approximately 10% of Aerospace's sales in 2016 were to its next four largest customers. Approximately 11% of Industrial's sales in 2016 were to its three largest customers. Some of our success will depend on the business strength and viability of those customers. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our largest customers. Some of our customers may in the future reduce their purchases due to economic conditions or shift their purchases from us to our competitors, in-house or to other sources. Some of our long-term sales agreements provide that until a firm order is placed by a customer for a particular product, the customer may unilaterally reduce or discontinue its projected purchases without penalty, or terminate for convenience. The loss of one or more of our largest customers, any reduction, cancellation or delay in sales to these customers (including a reduction in aftermarket volume in our RSPs), our inability to successfully develop relationships with new customers, or future price concessions we make to retain customers could significantly reduce our sales and profitability. The global nature of our business exposes us to foreign currency fluctuations that may affect our future revenues, debt levels and profitability. We have manufacturing facilities and technical service, sales and distribution centers around the world, and the majority of our foreign operations use the local currency as their functional currency. These include, among others, the Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, Euro, Japanese yen, Korean won, Mexican peso, Singapore dollar, Swedish krona, Swiss franc and Thai baht. Since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies expose us to translation risk when the local currency financial statements are translated to U.S. dollars. Changes in currency exchange rates may also expose us to transaction risk. We may buy hedges in certain currencies to reduce or offset our exposure to currency exchange fluctuations; however, these transactions may not be adequate or effective to protect us from the exposure for which they are purchased. We have not engaged in any speculative hedging activities. Currency fluctuations may adversely impact our revenues and profitability in the future.Our operations depend on our manufacturing, sales, and service facilities and information systems in various parts of the world which are subject to physical, financial, regulatory, environmental, operational and other risks that could disrupt our operations. We have a significant number of manufacturing facilities, technical service, and sales centers both within and outside the U.S. The global scope of our business subjects us to increased risks and uncertainties such as threats  4Table of Contentsof war, terrorism and instability of governments; and economic, regulatory and legal systems in countries in which we or our customers conduct business. Customer, supplier and our facilities are located in areas that may be affected by natural disasters, including earthquakes, windstorms and floods, which could cause significant damage and disruption to the operations of those facilities and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, some of our manufacturing equipment and tooling is custom-made and is not readily replaceable. Loss of such equipment or tooling could have a negative impact on our manufacturing business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Although we have obtained property damage and business interruption insurance, a major catastrophe such as an earthquake, windstorm, flood or other natural disaster at any of our sites, or significant labor strikes, work stoppages, political unrest, or any of the events described above, in any of the areas where we conduct operations could result in a prolonged interruption of our business. Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in the manufacture or shipment of products or the provision of repair and other services that may result in our loss of sales and customers. Our insurance will not cover all potential risks, and we cannot assure you that we will have adequate insurance to compensate us for all losses that result from any insured risks. Any material loss not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We cannot assure you that insurance will be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us or at a cost that will not have a material adverse effect on our profitability, net income and cash flows.The global nature of our operations and assets subject us to additional financial and regulatory risks. We have operations and assets in various parts of the world. In addition, we sell or may in the future sell our products and services to the U.S. and foreign governments and in foreign countries. As a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate, and associated risks, including: U.S. imposed embargoes of sales to specific countries; foreign import controls (which may be arbitrarily imposed or enforced); import regulations and duties; export regulations (which require us to comply with stringent licensing regimes); reporting requirements regarding the use of ""conflict"" minerals mined from certain countries; anti-dumping regulations; price and currency controls; exchange rate fluctuations; dividend remittance restrictions; expropriation of assets; war, civil uprisings and riots; government instability; government contracting requirements including cost accounting standards, including various procurement, security, and audit requirements, as well as requirements to certify to the government compliance with these requirements; the necessity of obtaining governmental approval for new and continuing products and operations; and legal systems or decrees, laws, taxes, regulations, interpretations and court decisions that are not always fully developed and that may be retroactively or arbitrarily applied. We have experienced inadvertent violations of some of these regulations, including export regulations, safety and environmental regulations, regulations prohibiting sales of certain products and product labeling regulations, in the past, none of which has had or, we believe, will have a material adverse effect on our business. However, any significant violations of these or other regulations in the future could result in civil or criminal sanctions, and the loss of export or other licenses which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are subject to federal and state unclaimed property laws in the ordinary course of business, and are currently undergoing a multi-state unclaimed property audit, the timing and outcome of which cannot be predicted, and we may incur significant professional fees in conjunction with the audit. We may also be subject to unanticipated income taxes, excise duties, import taxes, export taxes, value added taxes, or other governmental assessments, and taxes may be impacted by changes in legislation in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, our organizational and capital structure may limit our ability to transfer funds between countries, particularly into the U.S., without incurring adverse tax consequences. Any of these events could result in a loss of business or other unexpected costs that could reduce sales or profits and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Any disruption or failure in the operation of our information systems, including from conversions or integrations of information technology or reporting systems, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our information technology (IT) systems are an integral part of our business. We depend upon our IT systems to help process orders, manage inventory, make payments and collect accounts receivable. Our IT systems also allow us to purchase, sell and ship products efficiently and on a timely basis, to maintain cost-effective operations, and to help provide superior service to our customers. We are currently in the process of implementing enterprise resource planning (ERP) platforms across certain of our businesses, and we expect that we will need to continue to improve and further integrate our IT systems, on an ongoing basis in order to effectively run our business. If we fail to successfully manage and integrate our IT systems, including these ERP platforms, it could adversely affect our business or operating results.Further, in the ordinary course of our business, we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our  business operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers  5Table of Contentsor breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations, and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position. We have significant indebtedness that could affect our operations and financial condition, and our failure to meet certain financial covenants required by our debt agreements may materially and adversely affect our assets, financial position and cash flows. At December 31, 2016, we had consolidated debt obligations of $501.0 million, representing approximately 30% of our total capital (indebtedness plus stockholders’ equity) as of that date. Our level of indebtedness, proportion of variable rate debt obligations and the significant debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness may adversely affect our operations and financial condition. For example, our indebtedness could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, investments in technology and research and development, acquisitions, dividends and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industries in which we compete; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors, some of whom have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources than we do; limit our ability to borrow additional funds; or increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. In addition, a majority of our debt arrangements require us to maintain certain debt and interest coverage ratios and limit our ability to incur debt, make investments or undertake certain other business activities. These requirements could limit our ability to obtain future financing and may prevent us from taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. Our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our debt arrangements may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the restrictions could result in an event of default under our debt arrangements which, in turn, could result in an event of default under the terms of our other indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our debt arrangements, after the expiration of any grace periods, our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our debt arrangements, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to happen, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the payments due under those arrangements or our other indebtedness or that we could find alternative financing to replace that indebtedness.Conditions in the worldwide credit markets may limit our ability to expand our credit lines beyond current bank commitments.  In addition, our profitability may be adversely affected as a result of increases in interest rates. At December 31, 2016, we and our subsidiaries had $501.0 million aggregate principal amount of consolidated debt obligations outstanding, of which approximately 59% had interest rates that float with the market (not hedged against interest rate fluctuations). A 100 basis point increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in effect at December 31, 2016 would result in an approximate $3.0 million annualized increase in interest expense.Changes in the availability or price of materials, products and energy resources could adversely affect our costs and profitability. We may be adversely affected by the availability or price of raw materials, products and energy resources, particularly related to certain manufacturing operations that utilize steel, stainless steel, titanium, Inconel, Hastelloys and other specialty materials. The availability and price of raw materials and energy resources may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, new laws or regulations, global economic or political events including strikes, terrorist attacks and war, suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. In some instances there are limited sources for raw materials and a limited number of primary suppliers for some of our products for resale. Although we are not dependent upon any single source for any of our principal raw materials or products for resale, and such materials and products have, historically, been readily available, we cannot assure you that such raw materials and products will continue to be readily available. Disruption in the supply of raw materials, products or energy resources or our inability to come to favorable agreements with our suppliers could impair our ability to manufacture, sell and deliver our products and require us to pay higher prices. Any increase in prices for such raw materials, products or energy resources could materially adversely affect our costs and our profitability.  We maintain pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the U.S. and certain international locations. Our costs of providing defined benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on the plans’ assets, exchange rate fluctuations, future governmental regulation, global fixed income and equity prices, and our required and/or voluntary contributions to the plans. Declines in the stock market, prevailing interest rates, declines in discount rates, improvements in mortality rates and rising medical costs may cause an increase in our pension and other postretirement benefit expenses in the future and result in reductions in our pension fund asset values and increases in our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. These changes have caused and may continue to cause a significant reduction in our net worth and without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans’ assets, and  6Table of Contentsdepending upon the other factors listed above, we could be required to increase funding for some or all of these pension and postretirement plans. We carry significant inventories and a loss in net realizable value could cause a decline in our net worth. At December 31, 2016, our inventories totaled $227.8 million. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market based on management's judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels, quantities and prices at which such inventories will be sold in the normal course of business. Accelerating the disposal process or incorrect estimates of future sales potential may necessitate future reduction to inventory values. See “Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies”.  We have significant goodwill and an impairment of our goodwill could cause a decline in our net worth. Our total assets include substantial goodwill. At December 31, 2016, our goodwill totaled $633.4 million. The goodwill results from our prior acquisitions, representing the excess of the purchase price we paid over the net assets of the companies acquired. We assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill during each calendar year or sooner if triggering events warrant. If future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units does not meet expectations or fair values fall due to significant stock market declines, we may be required to reflect a non-cash charge to operating results for goodwill impairment. The recognition of an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material. See “Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies”.  We may not realize all of the sales expected from our existing backlog or anticipated orders. At December 31, 2016, we had $885.5 million of order backlog, the majority of which related to aerospace OEM customers. There can be no assurances that the revenues projected in our backlog will be realized or, if realized, will result in profits. We consider backlog to be firm customer orders for future delivery. OEM customers may provide projections of components and assemblies that they anticipate purchasing in the future under new and existing programs. Such projections are included in our backlog when they are supported by a long term agreement. Our customers may have the right under certain circumstances or with certain penalties or consequences to terminate, reduce or defer firm orders that we have in backlog. If our customers terminate, reduce or defer firm orders, we may be protected from certain costs and losses, but our sales will nevertheless be adversely affected. Although we strive to maintain ongoing relationships with our customers, there is an ongoing risk that orders may be canceled or rescheduled due to fluctuations in our customers’ business needs or purchasing budgets.  Also, our realization of sales from new and existing programs is inherently subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties, including whether our customers execute the launch of product programs on time, or at all, the number of units that our customers actually produce, the timing of production and manufacturing insourcing decisions made by our customers. In addition, until firm orders are placed, our customers may have the right to discontinue a program or replace us with another supplier at any time without penalty. Our failure to realize sales from new and existing programs could have a material adverse effect on our net sales, results of operations and cash flows.We may not recover all of our up-front costs related to new or existing programs. New programs may require significant up-front investments for capital equipment, engineering, inventory, design and tooling. As OEMs in the transportation and aerospace industries have looked to suppliers to bear increasing responsibility for the design, engineering and manufacture of systems and components, they have increasingly shifted the financial risk associated with those responsibilities to the suppliers as well. This trend may continue and is most evident in the area of engineering cost reimbursement. We cannot assure you that we will have adequate funds to make such up-front investments or to recover such costs from our customers as part of our product pricing. In the event that we are unable to make such investments, or to recover them through sales or direct reimbursement from our customers, our profitability, liquidity and cash flows may be adversely affected. In addition, we incur costs and make capital expenditures for new program awards based upon certain estimates of production volumes and production complexity. While we attempt to recover such costs and capital expenditures by appropriately pricing our products, the prices of our products are based in part upon planned production volumes. If the actual production is significantly less than planned or significantly more complex than anticipated, we may be unable to recover such costs. In addition, because a significant portion of our overall costs is fixed, declines in our customers’ production levels can adversely affect the level of our reported profits even if our up-front investments are recovered. We may not realize all of the intangible assets related to the Aerospace aftermarket businesses. We participate in aftermarket Revenue Sharing Programs (""RSPs"") under which we receive an exclusive right to supply designated aftermarket parts over the life of the related aircraft engine program to our customer, General Electric. As consideration, we pay participation fees, which are recorded as intangible assets and are recognized as a reduction of sales over the estimated life of the related engine programs which range up to 30 years. Our total investments in participation fees under our RSPs as of  7Table of ContentsDecember 31, 2016 equaled $293.7 million, all of which have been paid. At December 31, 2016, the remaining unamortized balance of these participation fees was $198.0 million. We entered into Component Repair Programs (""CRPs""), also with General Electric (""GE""), during the fourth quarter of 2013 (""CRP 1""), the second quarter of 2014 (""CRP 2"") and the fourth quarter of 2015 (""CRP 3"" and, collectively with CRP 1 and CRP 2, the ""CRPs""). The CRPs provide for, among other items, the right to sell certain aftermarket component repair services for CFM56, CF6, CF34 and LM engines directly to other customers as one of a few GE licensed suppliers. In addition, the CRPs extend certain existing contracts under which the Company currently provides these services directly to GE. We agreed to pay $26.6 million as consideration for the rights related to CRP 1. Of this balance, we paid $16.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, $9.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $0.9 million in the first quarter of 2016. We agreed to pay $80.0 million as consideration for the rights related to CRP 2. We paid $41.0 million in the second quarter of 2014, $20.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $19.0 million in the second quarter of 2015. We agreed to pay $5.2 million as consideration for the rights related to CRP 3. We paid $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $3.2 million was paid in December 2016. We recorded the CRP payments as an intangible asset which is recognized as a reduction of sales over the remaining useful life of these engine programs.The realizability of each asset is dependent upon future revenues related to the programs' aftermarket parts and services and is subject to impairment testing if circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. The potential exists that actual revenues will not meet expectations due to a change in market conditions, including, for example, the replacement of older engines with new, more fuel-efficient engines or our ability to maintain market share within the aftermarket business. A shortfall in future revenues may result in the failure to realize the net amount of the investments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, profitability could be impacted by the amortization of the participation fees and licenses, and the expiration of the international tax incentives on these programs. See “Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies”.  We face risks of cost overruns and losses on fixed-price contracts. We sell certain of our products under firm, fixed-price contracts providing for a fixed price for the products regardless of the production or purchase costs incurred by us. The cost of producing products may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, outside processing, overhead and other factors, including manufacturing inefficiencies. Increased production costs may result in cost overruns and losses on contracts. The departure of existing management and key personnel, a shortage of skilled employees or a lack of qualified sales professionals could materially affect our business, operations and prospects. Our executive officers are important to the management and direction of our business. Our future success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain or replace these officers and other capable management personnel. Although we believe we will be able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should the need arise, our inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Because of the complex nature of many of our products and services, we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilled workforce, including, for example, our engineering talent. In addition, there are significant costs associated with the hiring and training of sales professionals. We could be adversely affected by a shortage of available skilled employees or the loss of a significant number of our sales professionals. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights effectively, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We own or are licensed under various intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks and trade secrets. Our intellectual property rights may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage, and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. In addition, the steps that we have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged, invalidated, circumvented or designed-around, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. In some circumstances, enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons, or countries may require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property. We also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, confidential information, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect these intangible assets and will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information. Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage, adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position, financial condition and results of operations. 8Table of ContentsAny product liability, warranty, contractual or other claims in excess of insurance may adversely affect our financial condition. Our operations expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of our products and the products we buy from third parties and sell to our customers, or to potential warranty, contractual or other claims. For example, we may be exposed to potential liability for personal injury, property damage or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component designed, manufactured or sold by us, or the failure of an aircraft component that has been serviced by us or of the components themselves. While we have liability insurance for certain risks, our insurance may not cover all liabilities. Additionally, insurance coverage may not be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us. Any material liability not covered by insurance or for which third-party indemnification is not available for the full amount of the loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.From time to time, we receive product warranty claims, under which we may be required to bear costs of repair or replacement of certain of our products. Warranty claims may range from individual customer claims to full recalls of all products in the field. We vigorously defend ourselves in connection with these matters. We cannot, however, assure you that the costs, charges and liabilities associated with these matters will not be material, or that those costs, charges and liabilities will not exceed any amounts reserved for them in our consolidated financial statements. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted by strikes or work stoppages. Approximately 16% of our U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and more than 37% of our non-U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or statutory trade union agreements. The Company has a national collective bargaining agreement (“CBA”) with certain unionized employees at the Bristol, Connecticut and Corry, Pennsylvania facilities of the Associated Spring business unit, covering approximately 250 employees. The current CBA will expire in August 2017, at which time we will negotiate a successor agreement. The local collective bargaining agreement for the Milwaukee, Wisconsin facility of the Associated Spring business unit will expire on June 30, 2017, at which time we will negotiate a successor agreement. In addition, we have annual negotiations in Brazil and Mexico and, collectively, these negotiations cover approximately 300 employees in those two countries. In 2016, we also completed negotiations resulting in wage increases at four locations in our Industrial segment and one location in our Aerospace segment, collectively covering a total of approximately 900 employees.  Although we believe that our relations with our employees are good, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements or that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor, including healthcare, pensions or other benefits. Any potential strikes or work stoppages, and the resulting adverse impact on our relationships with customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Similarly, a protracted strike or work stoppage at any of our major customers, suppliers or other vendors could materially adversely affect our business. Changes in taxation requirements could affect our financial results. Our products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions in which we operate. Increases in indirect taxes could affect our products’ affordability and therefore reduce our sales. We are also subject to income tax in numerous jurisdictions in which we generate revenues. Changes in tax laws, tax rates or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. Among other things, our tax liabilities are affected by the mix of pretax income or loss among the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and the repatriation of foreign earnings to the U.S. Further, during the ordinary course of business, we are subject to examination by the various tax authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate which could result in an unanticipated increase in taxes. Potential tax reform discussed by the new U.S. administration, such as reducing the corporate income tax rate or changing the repatriation and taxation of foreign earnings, may impact income tax expenses, deferred tax assets in the U.S. and tax liability balances. Changes in accounting guidance could affect our financial results. New accounting guidance that may become applicable to us from time to time, or changes in the interpretations of existing guidance, could have a significant effect on our reported results for the affected periods. For example, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard for revenue recognition in May 2014 - Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)"". Although we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements, it is expected to change the way we account for certain of our sales transactions and reported backlog. Adoption of the standard could have a material impact on our financial statements and may retroactively affect the accounting treatment of transactions completed before adoption. See “Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Other Matters” for additional disclosure related to the Company's planned adoption of Topic 606.   9Table of ContentsRISKS RELATED TO THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE We operate in highly competitive markets. We may not be able to compete effectively with our competitors, and competitive pressures could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our two global business segments compete with a number of larger and smaller companies in the markets we serve. Some of our competitors have greater financial, production, research and development, or other resources than we do. Within Aerospace, certain of our OEM customers compete with our repair and overhaul business. Some of our OEM customers in the aerospace industry also compete with us where they have the ability to manufacture the components and assemblies that we supply to them but have chosen, for capacity limitations, cost considerations or other reasons, to outsource the manufacturing to us. Our customers award business based on, among other things, price, quality, reliability of supply, service, technology and design. Our competitors’ efforts to grow market share could exert downward pressure on our product pricing and margins. Our competitors may also develop products or services, or methods of delivering those products or services that are superior to our products, services or methods. Our competitors may adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with our existing or future competitors. Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in part, on our ability to continue make investments to innovate and manufacture the types of products demanded by our customers, and to reduce costs by such means as reducing excess capacity, leveraging global purchasing, improving productivity, eliminating redundancies and increasing production in low-cost countries. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, in increasing our manufacturing footprint in low-cost countries. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or that we will be successful in maintaining our competitive position. If we are unable to differentiate our products or maintain a low-cost footprint, we may lose market share or be forced to reduce prices, thereby lowering our margins. Any such occurrences could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The industries in which we operate have been experiencing consolidation, both in our suppliers and the customers we serve. Supplier consolidation is in part attributable to OEMs more frequently awarding long-term sole source or preferred supplier contracts to the most capable suppliers in an effort to reduce the total number of suppliers from whom components and systems are purchased. If consolidation of our existing competitors occurs, we would expect the competitive pressures we face to increase, and we cannot assure you that our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows will not be adversely impacted as a result of consolidation by our competitors or customers.Original equipment manufacturers in the aerospace and transportation industries have significant pricing leverage over suppliers and may be able to achieve price reductions over time. Additionally, we may not be successful in our efforts to raise prices on our customers. There is substantial and continuing pressure from OEMs in the transportation industries, including automotive and aerospace, to reduce the prices they pay to suppliers. We attempt to manage such downward pricing pressure, while trying to preserve our business relationships with our customers, by seeking to reduce our production costs through various measures, including purchasing raw materials and components at lower prices and implementing cost-effective process improvements. Our suppliers have periodically resisted, and in the future may resist, pressure to lower their prices and may seek to impose price increases. If we are unable to offset OEM price reductions, our profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, OEMs have substantial leverage in setting purchasing and payment terms, including the terms of accelerated payment programs under which payments are made prior to the account due date in return for an early payment discount. OEMs can unexpectedly change their purchasing policies or payment practices, which could have a negative impact on our short-term working capital. Demand for our defense-related products depends on government spending. A portion of Aerospace's sales is derived from the military market, including single-sourced and dual-sourced sales. The military market is largely dependent upon government budgets and is subject to governmental appropriations. Although multi-year contracts may be authorized in connection with major procurements, funds are generally appropriated on a fiscal year basis even though a program may be expected to continue for several years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded and additional funds are committed only as further appropriations are made. We cannot assure you that maintenance of or increases in defense spending will be allocated to programs that would benefit our business. Moreover, we cannot assure you that new military aircraft programs in which we participate will enter full-scale production as expected. A decrease in levels of defense spending or the government’s termination of, or failure to fully fund, one or more of the contracts for the programs in which we participate could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. The aerospace industry is highly regulated. Complications related to aerospace regulations may adversely affect the Company. A substantial portion of our income is derived from our aerospace businesses. The aerospace industry is highly regulated in the U.S. by the Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, and in other countries by similar regulatory agencies. We must be certified by these agencies and, in some cases, by individual OEMs in order to engineer and service systems and components used in specific aircraft models. If material authorizations or approvals were delayed, revoked or suspended, our  10Table of Contentsbusiness could be adversely affected. New or more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted, or industry oversight heightened, in the future, and we may incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or any heightened industry oversight. Fluctuations in jet fuel and other energy prices may impact our operating results. Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of operating expenses for companies in the aerospace industry. Fluctuations in fuel costs could impact levels and frequency of aircraft maintenance and overhaul activities, and airlines' decisions on maintaining, deferring or canceling new aircraft purchases, in part based on the value associated with new fuel efficient technologies. Widespread disruption to oil production, refinery operations and pipeline capacity in certain areas of the U.S. can impact the price of jet fuel significantly. Conflicts in the Middle East, an important source of oil for the U.S. and other countries where we do business, cause prices for fuel to be volatile. Because we and many of our customers are in the aerospace industry, these fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Our products and services may be rendered obsolete by new products, technologies and processes. Our manufacturing operations focus on highly engineered components which require extensive engineering and research and development time. Our competitive advantage may be adversely impacted if we cannot continue to introduce new products ahead of our competition, or if our products are rendered obsolete by other products or by new, different technologies and processes. The success of our new products will depend on a number of factors, including innovation, customer acceptance, the efficiency of our suppliers in providing materials and component parts, and the performance and quality of our products relative to those of our competitors. We cannot predict the level of market acceptance or the amount of market share our new products will achieve. Additionally, we may face increased or unexpected costs associated with new product introduction including the use of additional resources such as personnel. We cannot assure that we will not experience new product introduction delays in the future. RISKS RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING, ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES AND DIVESTITURES Our restructuring actions could have long-term adverse effects on our business. From time to time, we have implemented restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future. We may not achieve expected cost savings from workforce reductions or restructuring activities and actual charges, costs and adjustments due to these actions may vary materially from our estimates. Our ability to realize anticipated cost savings, synergies and revenue enhancements may be affected by a number of factors, including the following: our ability to effectively eliminate duplicative back office overhead and overlapping sales personnel, rationalize manufacturing capacity, synchronize information technology systems, consolidate warehousing and other facilities and shift production to more economical facilities; significant cash and non-cash integration and implementation costs or charges in order to achieve those cost savings, which could offset any such savings and other synergies resulting from our acquisitions or divestitures; and our ability to avoid labor disruption in connection with these activities. In addition, delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements may diminish the expected operational or financial benefits.    Our acquisition and other strategic initiatives may not be successful. We have made a number of acquisitions in the past, including most recently the acquisition of the FOBOHA business, and we anticipate that we may, from time to time, acquire additional businesses, assets or securities of companies, and enter into joint ventures and other strategic relationships that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our businesses. These activities expose the Company to a number of risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of any of which could materially adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. A portion of the industries that we serve are mature industries. As a result, our future growth may depend in part on the successful acquisition and integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations. We may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions, obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms, obtain regulatory approvals or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future. We could have difficulties integrating acquired businesses with our existing operations. Difficulties of integration can include coordinating and consolidating separate systems, integrating the management of the acquired business, retaining market acceptance of acquired products and services, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees, and implementing our enterprise resource planning systems and operational procedures and disciplines. Any such difficulties may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with employees, customers, business partners and suppliers. In addition, even if integration is successful, the financial performance of acquired business may not be as expected and there can be no assurance we will realize anticipated benefits from our acquisitions. We cannot assure you that we will effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business or product offerings or realize anticipated operational synergies. In connection with the integration of acquired operations or the conduct of our overall business strategies, we may periodically restructure our businesses and/or sell assets or portions of our business. Integrating the operations and personnel of acquired  11Table of Contentscompanies into our existing operations may result in difficulties, significant expense and accounting charges, disrupt our business or divert management’s time and attention.Acquisitions involve numerous other risks, including potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business. Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired businesses require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the business operations before we acquired it. However, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial condition. In connection with acquisitions or joint venture investments outside the U.S., we may enter into derivative contracts to purchase foreign currency in order to hedge against the risk of foreign currency fluctuations in connection with such acquisitions or joint venture investments, which subjects us to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations associated with such derivative contracts. Additionally, our final determinations and appraisals of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions may vary materially from earlier estimates. We cannot assure you that the fair value of acquired businesses will remain constant.We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment, and we cannot be certain that our business, operating results and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected. A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to any purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to retain, reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business, and collect the proceeds from any divestitures. In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other products offered by us. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of any divestiture transaction, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. In addition, divestitures of businesses involve a number of risks, including significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships, and a decrease in revenues and earnings associated with the divested business. Furthermore, divestitures potentially involve significant post-closing separation activities, which could involve the expenditure of material financial resources and significant employee resources. Any divestiture may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the dilutive impact from the loss of revenue associated with the divestiture, as well as significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  "
6,B,BARNES GROUP INC,2016-02-24,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks. Please note that additional risks not presently known to us may also materially impact our business and operations. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS We depend on revenues and earnings from a small number of significant customers. Any bankruptcy of or loss of or, cancellation, reduction or delay in purchases by these customers could harm our business. In 2015, our net sales to General Electric and its subsidiaries accounted for 18% of our total sales and approximately 51% of Aerospace's net sales. Aerospace's second largest customer, Rolls-Royce, accounted for 11% of total Aerospace net sales in 2015. Approximately 13%  3Table of Contentsof Aerospace's sales in 2015 were to its next two largest customers. Approximately 10% of Industrial's sales in 2015 were to its three largest customers. Some of our success will depend on the business strength and viability of those customers. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our largest customers. Some of our customers may in the future reduce their purchases due to economic conditions or shift their purchases from us to our competitors, in-house or to other sources. Some of our long-term sales agreements provide that until a firm order is placed by a customer for a particular product, the customer may unilaterally reduce or discontinue its projected purchases without penalty, or terminate for convenience. The loss of one or more of our largest customers, any reduction, cancellation or delay in sales to these customers (including a reduction in aftermarket volume in our RSPs), our inability to successfully develop relationships with new customers, or future price concessions we make to retain customers could significantly reduce our sales and profitability. The global nature of our business exposes us to foreign currency fluctuations that may affect our future revenues, debt levels and profitability. We have manufacturing facilities and technical service, sales and distribution centers around the world, and the majority of our foreign operations use the local currency as their functional currency. These include, among others, the Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, Euro, Japanese yen, Korean won, Mexican peso, Singapore dollar, Swedish krona, Swiss franc and Thai baht. Since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies expose us to translation risk when the local currency financial statements are translated to U.S. dollars. Changes in currency exchange rates may also expose us to transaction risk. We may buy hedges in certain currencies to reduce or offset our exposure to currency exchange fluctuations; however, these transactions may not be adequate or effective to protect us from the exposure for which they are purchased. We have not engaged in any speculative hedging activities. Currency fluctuations may adversely impact our revenues and profitability in the future.Our operations depend on our manufacturing, sales, and service facilities and information systems in various parts of the world which are subject to physical, financial, regulatory, environmental, operational and other risks that could disrupt our operations. We have a significant number of manufacturing facilities and technical service, and sales centers both within and outside the U.S. The international scope of our business subjects us to increased risks and uncertainties such as threats of war, terrorism and instability of governments; and economic, regulatory and legal systems in countries in which we or our customers conduct business. Some of our facilities are located in areas that may be affected by natural disasters, including earthquakes or tsunamis, which could cause significant damage and disruption to the operations of those facilities and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, some of our manufacturing equipment and tooling is custom-made and is not readily replaceable. Loss of such equipment or tooling could have a negative impact on our manufacturing business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Although we have obtained property damage and business interruption insurance, a major catastrophe such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, tsunami or other natural disaster at any of our sites, or significant labor strikes, work stoppages, political unrest, or any of the events described above, in any of the areas where we conduct operations could result in a prolonged interruption of our business. Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in the manufacture or shipment of products or the provision of repair and other services that may result in our loss of sales and customers. Our insurance will not cover all potential risks, and we cannot assure you that we will have adequate insurance to compensate us for all losses that result from any insured risks. Any material loss not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We cannot assure you that insurance will be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us or at a cost that will not have a material adverse effect on our profitability, net income and cash flows.The global nature of our operations and assets subject us to additional financial and regulatory risks. We have operations and assets in various parts of the world. In addition, we sell or may in the future sell our products and services to the U.S. and foreign governments and in foreign countries. As a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate, and associated risks, including: U.S. imposed embargoes of sales to specific countries; foreign import controls (which may be arbitrarily imposed or enforced); import regulations and duties; export regulations (which require us to comply with stringent licensing regimes); reporting requirements regarding the use of ""conflict"" minerals mined from certain countries; anti-dumping regulations; price and currency controls; exchange rate fluctuations; dividend remittance restrictions; expropriation of assets; war, civil uprisings and riots; government instability; government contracting requirements including cost accounting standards, including various procurement, security, and audit requirements, as well as requirements to certify to the government compliance with these requirements; the necessity of obtaining governmental approval for new and continuing products and operations; and legal systems or decrees, laws, taxes, regulations, interpretations and court decisions that are not always fully developed and that may be retroactively or arbitrarily applied. We have experienced inadvertent violations of some of these regulations, including export regulations, safety and  4Table of Contentsenvironmental regulations, regulations prohibiting sales of certain products and product labeling regulations, in the past, none of which has had or, we believe, will have a material adverse effect on our business. However, any significant violations of these or other regulations in the future could result in civil or criminal sanctions, and the loss of export or other licenses which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are subject to federal and state unclaimed property laws in the ordinary course of business, and are currently undergoing a multi-state unclaimed property audit, the timing and outcome of which cannot be predicted, and we may incur significant professional fees in conjunction with the audit. We may also be subject to unanticipated income taxes, excise duties, import taxes, export taxes, value added taxes, or other governmental assessments, and taxes may be impacted by changes in legislation in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, our organizational and capital structure may limit our ability to transfer funds between countries, particularly into the U.S., without incurring adverse tax consequences. Any of these events could result in a loss of business or other unexpected costs that could reduce sales or profits and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Any disruption or failure in the operation of our information systems, including from conversions or integrations of information technology or reporting systems, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our information technology (IT) systems are an integral part of our business. We depend upon our IT systems to help process orders, manage inventory and collect accounts receivable. Our IT systems also allow us to purchase, sell and ship products efficiently and on a timely basis, to maintain cost-effective operations, and to help provide superior service to our customers. We are currently in the process of implementing enterprise resource planning (ERP) platforms across certain of our businesses, and we expect that we will need to continue to improve and further integrate our IT systems, on an ongoing basis in order to effectively run our business. If we fail to successfully manage and integrate our IT systems, including these ERP platforms, it could adversely affect our business or operating results.Further, in the ordinary course of our business, we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our  business operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations, and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position. We have significant indebtedness that could affect our operations and financial condition, and our failure to meet certain financial covenants required by our debt agreements may materially and adversely affect our assets, financial position and cash flows. At December 31, 2015, we had consolidated debt obligations of $509.9 million, representing approximately 31% of our total capital (indebtedness plus stockholders’ equity) as of that date. Our level of indebtedness, proportion of variable rate debt obligations and the significant debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness may adversely affect our operations and financial condition. For example, our indebtedness could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, investments in technology and research and development, acquisitions, dividends and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industries in which we compete; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors, some of whom have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources than we do; limit our ability to borrow additional funds; or increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions.   In addition, a majority of our debt arrangements require us to maintain certain debt and interest coverage ratios and limit our ability to incur debt, make investments or undertake certain other business activities. These requirements could limit our ability to obtain future financing and may prevent us from taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. Our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our debt arrangements may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the restrictions could result in an event of default under our debt arrangements which, in turn, could result in an event of default under the terms of our other indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our debt arrangements, after the expiration of any grace periods, our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our debt arrangements, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to happen, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the payments due under those arrangements or our other indebtedness or that we could find alternative financing to replace that indebtedness.Conditions in the worldwide credit markets may limit our ability to expand our credit lines beyond current bank commitments.  In addition, our profitability may be adversely affected as a result of increases in interest rates. At December 31, 2015, we and our subsidiaries had approximately $509.9 million aggregate principal amount of consolidated debt obligations outstanding, of which approximately 59% had interest rates that float with the market (not hedged against interest rate  5Table of Contentsfluctuations). A 100 basis point increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in effect at December 31, 2015 would result in an approximate $3.0 million annualized increase in interest expense.Changes in the availability or price of materials, products and energy resources could adversely affect our costs and profitability. We may be adversely affected by the availability or price of raw materials, products and energy resources, particularly related to certain manufacturing operations that utilize steel, stainless steel, titanium, Inconel, Hastelloys and other specialty materials. The availability and price of raw materials and energy resources may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, new laws or regulations, global economic or political events including strikes, terrorist attacks and war, suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. In some instances there are limited sources for raw materials and a limited number of primary suppliers for some of our products for resale. Although we are not dependent upon any single source for any of our principal raw materials or products for resale, and such materials and products have, historically, been readily available, we cannot assure you that such raw materials and products will continue to be readily available. Disruption in the supply of raw materials, products or energy resources or our inability to come to favorable agreements with our suppliers could impair our ability to manufacture, sell and deliver our products and require us to pay higher prices. Any increase in prices for such raw materials, products or energy resources could materially adversely affect our costs and our profitability.  We maintain pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the U.S. and certain international locations. Our costs of providing defined benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on the plans’ assets, exchange rate fluctuations, future governmental regulation, global fixed income and equity prices, and our required and/or voluntary contributions to the plans. Declines in the stock market, prevailing interest rates, declines in discount rates, improvements in mortality rates and rising medical costs may cause an increase in our pension and other postretirement benefit expenses in the future and result in reductions in our pension fund asset values and increases in our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. These changes have caused and may continue to cause a significant reduction in our net worth and without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans’ assets, and depending upon the other factors listed above, we could be required to increase funding for some or all of these pension and postretirement plans. We carry significant inventories and a loss in net realizable value could cause a decline in our net worth. At December 31, 2015, our inventories totaled $208.6 million. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market based on management's judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels, quantities and prices at which such inventories will be sold in the normal course of business. Accelerating the disposal process or incorrect estimates of future sales potential may necessitate future reduction to inventory values. The Company's inventories include certain parts related to specific engines within the aftermarket repair and overhaul business. The demand for these parts and our ability to utilize these parts depends on the frequency and scope of repair and maintenance of aircraft engines and our ability to effectively access that market, and a decline in demand could require us to write off a portion of our inventory. See “Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies”.  We have significant goodwill and an impairment of our goodwill could cause a decline in our net worth. Our total assets include substantial goodwill. At December 31, 2015, our goodwill totaled $588.0 million. The goodwill results from our prior acquisitions, representing the excess of the purchase price we paid over the net assets of the companies acquired. We assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill during each calendar year or sooner if triggering events warrant. If future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units does not meet expectations or fair values fall due to significant stock market declines, we may be required to reflect a non-cash charge to operating results for goodwill impairment. The recognition of an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material. See “Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies”.  We may not realize all of the sales expected from our existing backlog or anticipated orders. At December 31, 2015, we had $763.8 million of order backlog, the majority of which related to aerospace OEM customers. There can be no assurances that the revenues projected in our backlog will be realized or, if realized, will result in profits. We consider backlog to be firm customer orders for future delivery. OEM customers may provide projections of components and assemblies that they anticipate purchasing in the future under new and existing programs. Such projections are included in our backlog when they are supported by a contract. Our customers may have the right under certain circumstances or with certain penalties or consequences to terminate, reduce or defer firm orders that we have in backlog. If our customers terminate, reduce or defer firm orders, we may be protected from certain costs and losses, but our sales will nevertheless be adversely affected. Although we strive to maintain ongoing relationships with our customers, there is an ongoing risk that orders may be cancelled or rescheduled due to fluctuations in our customers’ business needs or purchasing budgets.  6Table of ContentsAlso, our realization of sales from new and existing programs is inherently subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties, including whether our customers execute the launch of product programs on time, or at all, the number of units that our customers actually produce, the timing of production and manufacturing insourcing decisions made by our customers. In addition, until firm orders are placed, our customers generally have the right to discontinue a program or replace us with another supplier at any time without penalty. Our failure to realize sales from new and existing programs could have a material adverse effect on our net sales, results of operations and cash flows.We may not recover all of our up-front costs related to new or existing programs. New programs may require significant up-front investments for capital equipment, engineering, inventory, design and tooling. As OEMs in the transportation and aerospace industries have looked to suppliers to bear increasing responsibility for the design, engineering and manufacture of systems and components, they have increasingly shifted the financial risk associated with those responsibilities to the suppliers as well. This trend may continue and is most evident in the area of engineering cost reimbursement. We cannot assure you that we will have adequate funds to make such up-front investments or to recover such costs from our customers as part of our product pricing. In the event that we are unable to make such investments, or to recover them through sales or direct reimbursement from our customers, our profitability, liquidity and cash flows may be adversely affected. In addition, we incur costs and make capital expenditures for new program awards based upon certain estimates of production volumes and production complexity. While we attempt to recover such costs and capital expenditures by appropriately pricing our products, the prices of our products are based in part upon planned production volumes. If the actual production is significantly less than planned or significantly more complex than anticipated, we may be unable to recover such costs. In addition, because a significant portion of our overall costs is fixed, declines in our customers’ production levels can adversely affect the level of our reported profits even if our up-front investments are recovered. We may not realize all of the intangible assets related to the Aerospace aftermarket businesses. We participate in aftermarket RSPs under which we receive an exclusive right to supply designated aftermarket parts over the life of the related aircraft engine program to our customer, General Electric. As consideration, we pay participation fees, which are recorded as intangible assets and are recognized as a reduction of sales over the estimated useful life of the related engine programs which range up to 30 years. Our total investments in participation fees under our Revenue Sharing Programs (RSPs) as of December 31, 2015 equaled $293.7 million, all of which have been paid. At December 31, 2015, the remaining unamortized balance of these participation fees was $209.1 million. We entered into Component Repair Programs (""CRPs""), also with General Electric, during the fourth quarter of 2013 (""CRP 1""), the second quarter of 2014 (""CRP 2"") and the fourth quarter of 2015 (""CRP 3"" and, collectively with CRP 1 and CRP 2, the ""CRPs""). The CRPs provide for, among other items, the right to sell certain aftermarket component repair services for CFM56, CF6, CF34 and LM engines directly to other customers as one of a few GE licensed suppliers. In addition, the CRPs extend certain existing contracts under which the Company currently provides these services directly to GE. We agreed to pay $26.6 million as consideration for the rights related to CRP 1. Of this balance, we paid $16.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 and $9.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The remaining payment of $0.9 million has been included within accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We agreed to pay $80.0 million as consideration for the rights related to CRP 2. We paid $41.0 million in the second quarter of 2014, $20.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $19.0 million in the second quarter of 2015. We agreed to pay $5.2 million as consideration for the rights related to CRP 3. Of this balance, we paid $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The remaining payment of $3.2 million is due by December 31, 2016 and has also been included within accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We recorded the CRP payments as an intangible asset which is recognized as a reduction of sales over the remaining useful life of these engine programs. The realizability of each asset is dependent upon future revenues related to the programs' aftermarket parts and services and is subject to impairment testing if circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. The potential exists that actual revenues will not meet expectations due to a change in market conditions, including, for example, the replacement of older engines with new, more fuel-efficient engines or our ability to capture additional market share within the aftermarket business. A shortfall in future revenues may result in the failure to realize the net amount of the investments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, future growth and profitability could be impacted by the amortization of the participation fees and licenses, and the expiration of the international tax incentives on these programs.  We face risks of cost overruns and losses on fixed-price contracts. We sell certain of our products under firm, fixed-price contracts providing for a fixed price for the products regardless of the production or purchase costs incurred by us. The cost of producing products may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, outside processing,  7Table of Contentsoverhead and other factors, including manufacturing inefficiencies. Increased production costs may result in cost overruns and losses on contracts. The departure of existing management and key personnel, a shortage of skilled employees or a lack of qualified sales professionals could materially affect our business, operations and prospects. Our executive officers are important to the management and direction of our business. Our future success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain or replace these officers and other capable management personnel. Although we believe we will be able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should the need arise, our inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Because of the complex nature of many of our products and services, we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilled workforce, including, for example, our engineering talent. In addition, there are significant costs associated with the hiring and training of sales professionals. We could be adversely affected by a shortage of available skilled employees or the loss of a significant number of our sales professionals. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights effectively, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We own or are licensed under various intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks and trade secrets. Our intellectual property rights may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage, and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. In addition, the steps that we have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged, invalidated, circumvented or designed-around, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. In some circumstances, enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons, or countries may require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property. We also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, confidential information, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect these intangible assets and will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information. Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage, adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position, financial condition and results of operations.Any product liability, warranty, contractual or other claims in excess of insurance may adversely affect our financial condition. Our operations expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of our products and the products we buy from third parties and sell to our customers, or to potential warranty, contractual or other claims. For example, we may be exposed to potential liability for personal injury, property damage or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component designed, manufactured or sold by us, or the failure of an aircraft component that has been serviced by us or of the components themselves. While we have liability insurance for certain risks, our insurance may not cover all liabilities. Additionally, insurance coverage may not be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us. Any material liability not covered by insurance or for which third-party indemnification is not available for the full amount of the loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.From time to time, we receive product warranty claims, under which we may be required to bear costs of repair or replacement of certain of our products. Warranty claims may range from individual customer claims to full recalls of all products in the field. We vigorously defend ourselves in connection with these matters. We cannot, however, assure you that the costs, charges and liabilities associated with these matters will not be material, or that those costs, charges and liabilities will not exceed any amounts reserved for them in our consolidated financial statements. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted by strikes or work stoppages. Approximately 15% of our U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and more than 36% of our non-U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or statutory trade union agreements. The Company is currently in the process of negotiating a collective bargaining agreement (“CBA”) with certain unionized employees at the Bristol, Connecticut and Corry, Pennsylvania facilities, which are part of the Associated Spring business unit, and which covers approximately 240 employees. The current CBA expired on November 30, 2014, and we continue to negotiate a successor agreement. In addition, we have annual negotiations in Brazil and Mexico and, collectively, these negotiations cover approximately 300 employees in those two countries. We also completed negotiations in 2015 resulting in wage increases with two of our German locations, a Singapore location, and our Sweden location, which collectively cover approximately 676 employees. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are good, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements or that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor, including healthcare, pensions or other benefits. Any potential strikes or work stoppages, and the resulting adverse impact on our relationships with customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial  8Table of Contentscondition, results of operations or cash flows. Similarly, a protracted strike or work stoppage at any of our major customers, suppliers or other vendors could materially adversely affect our business.Changes in accounting guidance and taxation requirements could affect our financial results. New accounting guidance that may become applicable to us from time to time, or changes in the interpretations of existing guidance, could have a significant effect on our reported results for the affected periods. For example, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard for revenue recognition in May 2014 - Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)"". Although we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements, it will likely change the way we account for certain of our sales transactions. Adoption of the standard could have a significant impact on our financial statements and may retroactively affect the accounting treatment of transactions completed before adoption. In addition, our products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions in which we operate. Increases in indirect taxes could affect our products’ affordability and therefore reduce our sales. We are also subject to income tax in numerous jurisdictions in which we generate revenues. Changes in tax laws, tax rates or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. Among other things, our tax liabilities are affected by the mix of pretax income or loss among the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and the repatriation of foreign earnings to the U.S. Further, during the ordinary course of business, we are subject to examination by the various tax authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate which could result in an unanticipated increase in taxes.  Accordingly, we must exercise judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes, interest and penalties-while noting that, future events could change management’s assessment of these amounts. RISKS RELATED TO THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE We operate in highly competitive markets. We may not be able to compete effectively with our competitors, and competitive pressures could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our two global business segments compete with a number of larger and smaller companies in the markets we serve. Some of our competitors have greater financial, production, research and development, or other resources than we do. Within Aerospace, certain of our OEM customers compete with our repair and overhaul business. Some of our OEM customers in the aerospace industry also compete with us where they have the ability to manufacture the components and assemblies that we supply to them but have chosen, for capacity limitations, cost considerations or other reasons, to outsource the manufacturing to us. Our customers award business based on, among other things, price, quality, reliability of supply, service, technology and design. Our competitors’ efforts to grow market share could exert downward pressure on our product pricing and margins. Our competitors may also develop products or services, or methods of delivering those products or services that are superior to our products, services or methods. Our competitors may adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with our existing or future competitors. Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in part, on our ability to continue make investments to innovate and manufacture the types of products demanded by our customers, and to reduce costs by such means as reducing excess capacity, leveraging global purchasing, improving productivity, eliminating redundancies and increasing production in low-cost countries. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, in increasing our manufacturing footprint in low-cost countries. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or that we will be successful in maintaining our competitive position. If we are unable to differentiate our products or maintain a low-cost footprint, we may lose market share or be forced to reduce prices, thereby lowering our margins. Any such occurrences could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The industries in which we operate have been experiencing consolidation, both in our suppliers and the customers we serve. Supplier consolidation is in part attributable to OEMs more frequently awarding long-term sole source or preferred supplier contracts to the most capable suppliers in an effort to reduce the total number of suppliers from whom components and systems are purchased. If consolidation of our existing competitors occurs, we would expect the competitive pressures we face to increase, and we cannot assure you that our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows will not be adversely impacted as a result of consolidation by our competitors or customers.Original equipment manufacturers in the aerospace and transportation industries have significant pricing leverage over suppliers and may be able to achieve price reductions over time. Additionally, we may not be successful in our efforts to raise prices on our customers. There is substantial and continuing pressure from OEMs in the transportation industries, including automotive and aerospace, to reduce the prices they pay to suppliers. We attempt to manage such downward pricing pressure, while trying to preserve our business relationships with our customers, by seeking to reduce our production costs through various measures, including purchasing raw materials and components at lower prices and implementing cost-effective process improvements. Our suppliers have periodically resisted, and in the future may resist, pressure to lower their prices and may seek to impose price increases. If we are unable to offset OEM price reductions, our profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, OEMs have substantial leverage in setting purchasing and  9Table of Contentspayment terms, including the terms of accelerated payment programs under which payments are made prior to the account due date in return for an early payment discount. OEMs can unexpectedly change their purchasing policies or payment practices, which could have a negative impact on our short-term working capital. Demand for our defense-related products depends on government spending. A portion of Aerospace's sales is derived from the military market, including single-sourced and dual-sourced sales. The military market is largely dependent upon government budgets and is subject to governmental appropriations. Although multi-year contracts may be authorized in connection with major procurements, funds are generally appropriated on a fiscal year basis even though a program may be expected to continue for several years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded and additional funds are committed only as further appropriations are made. We cannot assure you that maintenance of or increases in defense spending will be allocated to programs that would benefit our business. Moreover, we cannot assure you that new military aircraft programs in which we participate will enter full-scale production as expected. A decrease in levels of defense spending or the government’s termination of, or failure to fully fund, one or more of the contracts for the programs in which we participate could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. The aerospace industry is highly regulated. Complications related to aerospace regulations may adversely affect the Company. A substantial portion of our income is derived from our aerospace businesses. The aerospace industry is highly regulated in the U.S. by the Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, and in other countries by similar regulatory agencies. We must be certified by these agencies and, in some cases, by individual OEMs in order to engineer and service systems and components used in specific aircraft models. If material authorizations or approvals were delayed, revoked or suspended, our business could be adversely affected. New or more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted, or industry oversight heightened, in the future, and we may incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or any heightened industry oversight. Environmental regulations impose costs and regulatory requirements on our operations. Environmental compliance may be more costly than we expect, and we may be subject to material environmental-based claims in the future. Our past and present business operations and past and present ownership and operations of real property and the use, sale, storage and handling of chemicals and hazardous products subject us to extensive and changing U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, as well as those of other countries, pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, enforcement, disposition of wastes (including hazardous wastes), the use, shipping, labeling, and storage of chemicals and hazardous materials, building requirements, or otherwise relating to protection of the environment. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations. In addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become subject to new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations. In addition, many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we monitor hazardous waste management and applicable environmental permitting and reporting for compliance with applicable laws at our locations in the ordinary course of our business. We may be subject to potential material liabilities relating to any investigation and clean-up of our locations or properties where we delivered hazardous waste for handling or disposal that may be contaminated or which may have been contaminated prior to our purchase, and to claims alleging personal injury.  Fluctuations in jet fuel and other energy prices may impact our operating results. Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of operating expenses for companies in the aerospace industry. Fluctuations in fuel costs could impact levels and frequency of aircraft maintenance and overhaul activities, and airlines' decisions on maintaining, deferring or canceling new aircraft purchases, in part based on the value associated with new fuel efficient technologies. Widespread disruption to oil production, refinery operations and pipeline capacity in certain areas of the U.S. can impact the price of jet fuel significantly. Conflicts in the Middle East, an important source of oil for the U.S. and other countries where we do business, cause prices for fuel to be volatile. Because we and many of our customers are in the aerospace industry, these fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Our products and services may be rendered obsolete by new products, technologies and processes. Our manufacturing operations focus on highly engineered components which require extensive engineering and research and development time. Our competitive advantage may be adversely impacted if we cannot continue to introduce new products ahead of our competition, or if our products are rendered obsolete by other products or by new, different technologies and processes. The success of our new products will depend on a number of factors, including innovation, customer acceptance, the efficiency of our suppliers in providing materials and component parts, and the performance and quality of our products relative to those of our competitors. We cannot predict the level of market acceptance or the amount of market share our new products  10Table of Contentswill achieve. Additionally, we may face increased or unexpected costs associated with new product introduction including the use of additional resources such as personnel. We cannot assure that we will not experience new product introduction delays in the future. RISKS RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING, ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES AND DIVESTITURES Our restructuring actions could have long-term adverse effects on our business. From time to time, we have implemented restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future. We may not achieve expected cost savings from workforce reductions or restructuring activities and actual charges, costs and adjustments due to these actions may vary materially from our estimates. Our ability to realize anticipated cost savings, synergies and revenue enhancements may be affected by a number of factors, including the following: our ability to effectively eliminate duplicative back office overhead and overlapping sales personnel, rationalize manufacturing capacity, synchronize information technology systems, consolidate warehousing and other facilities and shift production to more economical facilities; significant cash and non-cash integration and implementation costs or charges in order to achieve those cost savings, which could offset any such savings and other synergies resulting from our acquisitions or divestitures; and our ability to avoid labor disruption in connection with these activities. In addition, delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements may diminish the expected operational or financial benefits.Our acquisition and other strategic initiatives may not be successful. We have made a number of acquisitions in the past, including most recently the acquisitions of the Thermoplay and Priamus businesses, and we anticipate that we may, from time to time, acquire additional businesses, assets or securities of companies, and enter into joint ventures and other strategic relationships that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our businesses. These activities expose the Company to a number of risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of any of which could materially adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. A portion of the industries that we serve are mature industries. As a result, our future growth may depend in part on the successful acquisition and integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations. We may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions, obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms, obtain regulatory approvals or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future. We could have difficulties integrating acquired businesses with our existing operations. Difficulties of integration can include coordinating and consolidating separate systems, integrating the management of the acquired business, retaining market acceptance of acquired products and services, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees, and implementing our enterprise resource planning systems and operational procedures and disciplines. Any such difficulties may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with employees, customers, business partners and suppliers. In addition, even if integration is successful, the financial performance of acquired business may not be as expected and there can be no assurance we will realize anticipated benefits from our acquisitions. We cannot assure you that we will effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business or product offerings or realize anticipated operational synergies. In connection with the integration of acquired operations or the conduct of our overall business strategies, we may periodically restructure our businesses and/or sell assets or portions of our business. Integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies into our existing operations may result in difficulties, significant expense and accounting charges, disrupt our business or divert management’s time and attention.Acquisitions involve numerous other risks, including potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business. Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired businesses require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the business operations before we acquired it. However, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial condition. In connection with acquisitions or joint venture investments outside the U.S., we may enter into derivative contracts to purchase foreign currency in order to hedge against the risk of foreign currency fluctuations in connection with such acquisitions or joint venture investments, which subjects us to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations associated with such derivative contracts. Additionally, our final determinations and appraisals of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions may vary materially from earlier estimates. We cannot assure you that the fair value of acquired businesses will remain constant.We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment, and we cannot be certain that our business, operating results and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected. A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to any purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to retain, reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business, and collect the proceeds from any divestitures. In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners,  11Table of Contentsthis may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other products offered by us. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of any divestiture transaction, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. In addition, divestitures of businesses involve a number of risks, including significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships, and a decrease in revenues and earnings associated with the divested business. Furthermore, divestitures potentially involve significant post-closing separation activities, which could involve the expenditure of material financial resources and significant employee resources. Any divestiture may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the dilutive impact from the loss of revenue associated with the divestiture, as well as significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  "
8,B,BARNES GROUP INC,2015-02-23,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
 Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks. Please note that additional risks not presently known to us may also materially impact our business and operations. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS We depend on revenues and earnings from a small number of significant customers. Any bankruptcy of or loss, cancellation, reduction or delay in purchases by these customers could harm our business. In 2014, our net sales to General Electric and its subsidiaries accounted for 19% of our total sales and approximately 54% of Aerospace's net sales.  Additionally, approximately 16% of Aerospace's sales in 2014 were to its next two largest customers. Approximately 10% of Industrial's sales in 2014 were to its three largest customers. Some of our success will depend on the business strength and viability of those customers. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our largest customers. A tightening in the credit markets may affect our customers’ ability to raise debt or equity capital. This may reduce the amount of liquidity available to our customers which may limit their ability to purchase products. Some of our customers may in the future reduce their purchases due to economic conditions or shift their purchases from us to our competitors, in-house or to other sources. Some of our long-term sales agreements provide that until a firm order is placed by a customer for a particular product, the customer may unilaterally reduce or discontinue its projected purchases without penalty, or terminate for convenience. The loss of one or more of our largest customers, any reduction, cancellation or delay in sales to these customers (including a reduction in aftermarket volume in our RSPs), our inability to successfully develop relationships with new customers, or future price concessions we make to retain customers could significantly reduce our sales and profitability.  We have significant indebtedness that could affect our operations and financial condition. At December 31, 2014, we had consolidated debt obligations of $504.7 million, representing approximately 31% of our total capital (indebtedness plus stockholders’ equity) as of that date. Our level of indebtedness, proportion of variable rate debt obligations and the significant debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness may adversely affect our operations and financial condition. For example, our indebtedness could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, investments in technology and research and development, acquisitions, dividends and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industries in which we compete; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors, some of whom have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources than we do; limit our ability to borrow additional funds; or increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. In addition, conditions in the worldwide credit markets may limit our ability to expand our credit lines beyond current bank commitments.Economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Prolonged slow growth or a downturn, worsening or broadening of adverse conditions in the worldwide and domestic economies could affect purchases of our products, and create or exacerbate credit issues, cash flow issues and other financial hardships for us and for our suppliers and customers. Depending upon their severity and duration, these conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Our failure to meet certain financial covenants required by our debt agreements may materially and adversely affect our assets, financial position and cash flows. A majority of our debt arrangements require us to maintain certain debt and interest coverage ratios and limit our ability to incur debt, make investments or undertake certain other business activities. These requirements could limit our ability to obtain future financing and may prevent us from taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. Our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our debt arrangements may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the restrictions could result in an event of default under our debt arrangements which, in turn, could result in an event of default under the terms of our other indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our debt arrangements, after the expiration of any grace periods, our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our debt arrangements, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to  4Table of Contentshappen, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the payments due under those arrangements or our other indebtedness or that we could find alternative financing to replace that indebtedness. Our operations depend on our manufacturing, sales, and service facilities and information systems in various parts of the world which are subject to physical, financial, regulatory, environmental, operational and other risks that could disrupt our operations. We have a significant number of manufacturing facilities and technical service, and sales centers both within and outside the U.S. The international scope of our business subjects us to increased risks and uncertainties such as threats of war, terrorism and instability of governments; compliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the U.S., such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and economic, regulatory and legal systems in countries in which we or our customers conduct business. Some of our facilities are located in areas that may be affected by natural disasters, including earthquakes or tsunamis, which could cause significant damage and disruption to the operations of those facilities and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, some of our manufacturing equipment and tooling is custom-made and is not readily replaceable. Loss of such equipment or tooling could have a negative impact on our manufacturing business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Although we have obtained property damage and business interruption insurance, a major catastrophe such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, tsunami or other natural disaster at any of our sites, or significant labor strikes, work stoppages, political unrest, or any of the events described above, in any of the areas where we conduct operations could result in a prolonged interruption of our business. Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in the manufacture or shipment of products or the provision of repair and other services that may result in our loss of sales and customers. Our insurance will not cover all potential risks, and we cannot assure you that we will have adequate insurance to compensate us for all losses that result from any insured risks. Any material loss not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We cannot assure you that insurance will be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us or at a cost that will not have a material adverse effect on our profitability, net income and cash flows.Any disruption or failure in the operation of our information systems, including from conversions or integrations of information technology or reporting systems, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our information technology (IT) systems are an integral part of our business. We depend upon our IT systems to help process orders, manage inventory and collect accounts receivable. Our IT systems also allow us to purchase, sell and ship products efficiently and on a timely basis, to maintain cost-effective operations, and to help provide superior service to our customers. We are currently in the process of implementing enterprise resource planning (ERP) platforms across certain of our businesses, and we expect that we will need to continue to improve and further integrate our IT systems, on an ongoing basis in order to effectively run our business. If we fail to successfully manage and integrate our IT systems, including these ERP platforms, it could adversely affect our business or operating results.Further, in the ordinary course of our business, we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our  business operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations, and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position. The global nature of our business exposes us to foreign currency fluctuations that may affect our future revenues, debt levels and profitability. We have manufacturing facilities and technical service, sales and distribution centers around the world, and the majority of our foreign operations use the local currency as their functional currency. These include, among others, the Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, Euro, Japanese yen, Korean won, Mexican peso, Singapore dollar, Swedish krona, Swiss franc and Thai baht. Since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies expose us to translation risk when the local currency financial statements are translated to U.S. dollars. Changes in currency exchange rates may also expose us to transaction risk. We may buy protecting or offsetting positions or hedges in certain currencies to reduce our exposure to currency exchange fluctuations; however, these transactions may not be adequate or effective to protect us from the exposure for which they are purchased. We have not engaged in any speculative hedging activities. Currency fluctuations may impact our revenues and profitability in the future. 5Table of ContentsThe global nature of our operations and assets subject us to additional financial and regulatory risks. We have operations and assets in various parts of the world. In addition, we sell or may in the future sell our products and services to the U.S. and foreign governments and in foreign countries. As a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate, and associated risks, including: U.S. imposed embargoes of sales to specific countries; foreign import controls (which may be arbitrarily imposed or enforced); import regulations and duties; export regulations (which require us to comply with stringent licensing regimes); anti-dumping regulations; unclaimed property regulations; price and currency controls; exchange rate fluctuations; dividend remittance restrictions; expropriation of assets; war, civil uprisings and riots; government instability; government contracting requirements including cost accounting standards, including various procurement, security, and audit requirements, as well as requirements to certify to the government compliance with these requirements; the necessity of obtaining governmental approval for new and continuing products and operations; and legal systems or decrees, laws, taxes, regulations, interpretations and court decisions that are not always fully developed and that may be retroactively or arbitrarily applied. We have experienced inadvertent violations of some of these regulations, including export regulations, safety and environmental regulations, regulations prohibiting sales of certain products and product labeling regulations, in the past, none of which has had or, we believe, will have a material adverse effect on our business. However, any significant violations of these or other regulations in the future could result in civil or criminal sanctions, and the loss of export or other licenses which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may also be subject to unanticipated income taxes, excise duties, import taxes, export taxes, value added taxes, or other governmental assessments, and taxes may be impacted by changes in legislation in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, our organizational and capital structure may limit our ability to transfer funds between countries, particularly into the U.S., without incurring adverse tax consequences. Any of these events could result in a loss of business or other unexpected costs that could reduce sales or profits and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our ability to recover deferred tax assets depends on future income. From time to time, we may have significant deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income.  In the event we do not generate sufficient taxable income, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Changes in the availability or price of materials, products and energy resources could adversely affect our costs and profitability. We may be adversely affected by the availability or price of raw materials, products and energy resources, particularly related to certain manufacturing operations that utilize steel, stainless steel, titanium, Inconel, Hastelloys and other specialty materials. The availability and price of raw materials and energy resources may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, new laws or regulations, global economic or political events including strikes, terrorist attacks and war, suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. In some instances there are limited sources for raw materials and a limited number of primary suppliers for some of our products for resale. Although we are not dependent upon any single source for any of our principal raw materials or products for resale, and such materials and products have, historically, been readily available, we cannot assure you that such raw materials and products will continue to be readily available. Disruption in the supply of raw materials, products or energy resources or our inability to come to favorable agreements with our suppliers could impair our ability to manufacture, sell and deliver our products and require us to pay higher prices. Any increase in prices for such raw materials, products or energy resources could materially adversely affect our costs and our profitability. Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC established disclosure and reporting requirements regarding the use of “conflict minerals"" mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. These requirements could adversely affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of certain of our products. As a result, we may not be able to obtain certain materials or products at competitive prices. We have and expect to continue to incur costs to comply with these new requirements, including for due diligence to identify the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products. Further, we may face reputational risk and other challenges with our customers and suppliers if we are unable to verify sufficiently that the minerals used in our products are conflict free.  We maintain pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the U.S. and certain international locations. Our costs of providing defined benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on the plans’ assets, exchange rate fluctuations, future governmental regulation, global equity prices, and our required and/or voluntary contributions to the plans. Declines in the stock market, prevailing interest rates, declines in discount rates, improvements in mortality rates and rising medical costs may cause an increase in our pension and other postretirement benefit expenses in the future and result in reductions in our pension fund asset values and increases in our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. These changes have caused and may continue to cause a significant reduction in our net worth and without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans’ assets, and depending upon the other factors listed above, we could be required to increase funding for some or all of these pension and postretirement plans.  6Table of ContentsOur cash is highly concentrated with certain financial institutions.  At various times we have a concentration of cash in accounts with financial institutions in the U.S. and around the globe.  Our holdings in certain of these institutions significantly exceeded the insured limits of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or their equivalent outside the U.S. at December 31, 2014.We carry significant inventories and a loss in net realizable value could cause a decline in our net worth. At December 31, 2014, our inventories totaled $212.0 million. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market based on management's judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels, quantities and prices at which such inventories will be sold in the normal course of business. Accelerating the disposal process or incorrect estimates of future sales potential may necessitate future reduction to inventory values. The Company's inventories include certain parts related to specific engines within the aftermarket repair and overhaul business. The demand for these parts and our ability to utilize these parts depends on the frequency and scope of repair and maintenance of aircraft engines and our ability to effectively access that market, and a decline in demand could require us to write off a portion of our inventory. See “Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies”.  We have significant goodwill and an impairment of our goodwill could cause a decline in our net worth. Our total assets include substantial goodwill. At December 31, 2014, our goodwill totaled $594.9 million. The goodwill results from our prior acquisitions, representing the excess of the purchase price we paid over the net assets of the companies acquired. We assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill during each calendar year or sooner if triggering events warrant. If future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units does not meet expectations or fair values fall due to significant stock market declines, we may be required to reflect a non-cash charge to operating results for goodwill impairment. The recognition of an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material. See “Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies”.  We could be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. Our profitability may be adversely affected as a result of increases in interest rates. At December 31, 2014, we and our subsidiaries had approximately $504.7 million aggregate principal amount of consolidated debt obligations outstanding, of which approximately 60% had interest rates that float with the market (not hedged against interest rate fluctuations). A 100 basis point increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in effect at December 31, 2014 would result in an approximate $3.0 million annualized increase in interest expense. We may not realize all of the sales expected from our existing backlog or anticipated orders. At December 31, 2014, we had $728.6 million of order backlog, the majority of which related to aerospace OEM customers. There can be no assurances that the revenues projected in our backlog will be realized or, if realized, will result in profits. We consider backlog to be firm customer orders for future delivery. From time to time, OEM customers provide projections of components and assemblies that they anticipate purchasing in the future under new and existing programs. Such projections are not included in our backlog unless we have received a firm order from our customers. Our customers may have the right under certain circumstances or with certain penalties or consequences to terminate, reduce or defer firm orders that we have in backlog. If our customers terminate, reduce or defer firm orders, we may be protected from certain costs and losses, but our sales will nevertheless be adversely affected. Although we strive to maintain ongoing relationships with our customers, there is an ongoing risk that orders may be cancelled or rescheduled due to fluctuations in our customers’ business needs or purchasing budgets. Also, our realization of sales from new and existing programs is inherently subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties, including whether our customers execute the launch of product programs on time, or at all, the number of units that our customers actually produce, the timing of production and manufacturing insourcing decisions made by our customers. In addition, until firm orders are placed, our customers generally have the right to discontinue a program or replace us with another supplier at any time without penalty. Our failure to realize sales from new and existing programs could have a material adverse effect on our net sales, results of operations and cash flows.We may not recover all of our up-front costs related to new or existing programs. New programs may require significant up-front investments for capital equipment, engineering, inventory, design and tooling. As OEMs in the transportation and aerospace industries have looked to suppliers to bear increasing responsibility for the design, engineering and manufacture of systems and components, they have increasingly shifted the financial risk associated with those responsibilities to the suppliers as well. This trend may continue and is most evident in the area of engineering cost reimbursement. We cannot assure you that we will have adequate funds to make such up-front investments or to recover such costs from our customers as part of our product pricing. In the event that we are unable to make such investments, or to recover them through sales or direct reimbursement from our customers, our profitability, liquidity and cash flows may be adversely affected. In addition, we incur costs and make capital expenditures for new program awards based upon certain estimates of  7Table of Contentsproduction volumes and production complexity. While we attempt to recover such costs and capital expenditures by appropriately pricing our products, the prices of our products are based in part upon planned production volumes. If the actual production is significantly less than planned or significantly more complex than anticipated, we may be unable to recover such costs. In addition, because a significant portion of our overall costs is fixed, declines in our customers’ production levels can adversely affect the level of our reported profits even if our up-front investments are recovered. We may not realize all of the intangible assets related to the Aerospace aftermarket businesses. Our total investments in participation fees under our Revenue Sharing Programs (RSPs) as of December 31, 2014 equaled $293.7 million, all of which have been paid. At December 31, 2014, the remaining unamortized balance of these participation fees was $220.7 million. We participate in aftermarket RSPs under which we receive an exclusive right to supply designated aftermarket parts over the life of the related aircraft engine program to our customer, General Electric. As consideration, we pay participation fees, which are recorded as intangible assets and are recognized as a reduction of sales over the estimated useful life of the related engine programs which range up to 30 years.We entered into Component Repair Programs (""CRPs""), also with General Electric, during the fourth quarter of 2013 (""CRP 1"") and the second quarter of 2014 (""CRP 2""). The CRPs provide for, among other items, the right to sell certain aftermarket component repair services for CFM56, CF6 and LM engines directly to other customers as one of a few GE licensed suppliers. In addition, the CRPs extend certain existing contracts under which the Company currently provides these services directly to GE. We agreed to pay $26.6 million as consideration for the rights related to CRP 1. Of this balance, we paid $16.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 and $9.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The remaining payment of $0.9 million has been included within accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We agreed to pay $80.0 million as consideration for the rights related to CRP 2. We paid $41.0 million in the second quarter of 2014, $20.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the remaining payment of $19.0 million, also included within accrued liabilities, will be paid in the second quarter of 2015. We recorded the CRP payments as an intangible asset which is recognized as a reduction of sales over the remaining useful life of these engine programs. The realizability of each asset is dependent upon future revenues related to the programs' aftermarket parts and services and is subject to impairment testing if circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. The potential exists that actual revenues will not meet expectations due to a change in market conditions, including, for example, the replacement of older engines with new, more fuel-efficient engines or our ability to capture additional market share within the aftermarket business. A shortfall in future revenues may result in the failure to realize the net amount of the investments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, future growth and profitability could be impacted by the amortization of the participation fees and licenses, and the expiration of the international tax incentives on these programs.  We face risks of cost overruns and losses on fixed-price contracts. We sell certain of our products under firm, fixed-price contracts providing for a fixed price for the products regardless of the production or purchase costs incurred by us. The cost of producing products may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, outside processing, overhead and other factors, including manufacturing inefficiencies. Increased production costs may result in cost overruns and losses on contracts. The departure of existing management and key personnel, a shortage of skilled employees or a lack of qualified sales professionals could materially affect our business, operations and prospects. Our executive officers are important to the management and direction of our business. Our future success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain or replace these officers and other capable management personnel. Although we believe we will be able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should the need arise, our inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Because of the complex nature of many of our products and services, we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilled workforce, including, for example, our engineering talent. In addition, there are significant costs associated with the hiring and training of sales professionals. We could be adversely affected by a shortage of available skilled employees or the loss of a significant number of our sales professionals. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights effectively, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We own or are licensed under various intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks and trade secrets. Our intellectual property rights may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage, and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. In addition, the steps that we have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged, invalidated, circumvented or designed-around, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not  8Table of Contentshighly developed or protected. In some circumstances, enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons, or countries may require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property. We also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, confidential information, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect these intangible assets and will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information. Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage, adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position, financial condition and results of operations.Any product liability, warranty, contractual or other claims in excess of insurance may adversely affect our financial condition. Our operations expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of our products and the products we buy from third parties and sell to our customers, or to potential warranty, contractual or other claims. For example, we may be exposed to potential liability for personal injury, property damage or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component designed, manufactured or sold by us, or the failure of an aircraft component that has been serviced by us or of the components themselves. While we have liability insurance for certain risks, our insurance may not cover all liabilities. Additionally, insurance coverage may not be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us. Any material liability not covered by insurance or for which third-party indemnification is not available for the full amount of the loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.From time to time, we receive product warranty claims, under which we may be required to bear costs of repair or replacement of certain of our products. Warranty claims may range from individual customer claims to full recalls of all products in the field. We vigorously defend ourselves in connection with these matters. We cannot, however, assure you that the costs, charges and liabilities associated with these matters will not be material, or that those costs, charges and liabilities will not exceed any amounts reserved for them in our consolidated financial statements. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted by strikes or work stoppages. Approximately 15% of our U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and more than 32% of our non-U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or statutory trade union agreements. The Company is currently in the process of negotiating a collective bargaining agreement (“CBA”) with certain unionized employees at the Bristol, Connecticut and Corry, Pennsylvania facilities, which are located within the Associated Spring business unit, and which covers approximately 233 employees. The current CBA expired on November 30, 2014, and we continue to negotiate a successor agreement. In 2015, we are also scheduled to conduct local negotiations with our unionized employees at our Corry, Pennsylvania facility, which covers approximately 130 employees. In addition, we have annual negotiations in Brazil and Mexico and, collectively, these negotiations cover approximately 329 employees in those two countries. We also expect to have negotiations in 2015 with two of our German locations, a Singapore location, and our Sweden location, which collectively cover over 500 employees. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are good, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements or that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor, including healthcare, pensions or other benefits. Any potential strikes or work stoppages, and the resulting adverse impact on our relationships with customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Similarly, a protracted strike or work stoppage at any of our major customers, suppliers or other vendors could materially adversely affect our business. Changes in accounting guidance and taxation requirements could affect our financial results. New accounting guidance that may become applicable to us from time to time, or changes in the interpretations of existing guidance, could have a significant effect on our reported results for the affected periods. For example, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard for revenue recognition in May 2014 - Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)"". Although we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements, it could change the way we account for certain of our sales transactions. Adoption of the standard could have a significant impact on our financial statements and may retroactively affect the accounting treatment of transactions completed before adoption. In addition, our products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions in which we operate. Increases in indirect taxes could affect our products’ affordability and therefore reduce our sales. We are also subject to income tax in numerous jurisdictions in which we generate revenues. Changes in tax laws, tax rates or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. Among other things, our tax liabilities are affected by the mix of pretax income or loss among the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and the repatriation of foreign earnings to the U.S. We must exercise judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes, interest and penalties; accordingly, future events could change management’s assessment of these amounts.  9Table of ContentsRISKS RELATED TO THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE A general economic downturn could adversely affect our business and financial results. All of our businesses are impacted by the health of the economies in which they operate. A decline in economies in which we operate could reduce demand for our products and services or increase pricing pressures, thereby having an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We derive a large portion of our sales from the transportation industry. The operation of our business within that industry subjects us to the pressures applicable to all companies operating in it, including unfavorable pricing pressures. While the precise effects of instability in the transportation industry are difficult to determine, they may negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We operate in very competitive markets. We may not be able to compete effectively with our competitors, and competitive pressures could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our two global business segments compete with a number of larger and smaller companies in the markets we serve. Some of our competitors have greater financial, production, research and development, or other resources than we do. Within Aerospace, certain of our OEM customers compete with our repair and overhaul business. Some of our OEM customers in the aerospace industry also compete with us where they have the ability to manufacture the components and assemblies that we supply to them but have chosen, for capacity limitations, cost considerations or other reasons, to outsource the manufacturing to us. Our two business segments compete on the basis of price, service, quality, reliability of supply, technology, innovation and design. We must continue to make investments to maintain and improve our competitive position. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or that we will be successful in maintaining our competitive position. Our competitors may develop products or services, or methods of delivering those products or services that are superior to our products, services or methods. Our competitors may also adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. Pricing pressures could cause us to adjust the prices of certain of our products to stay competitive. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with our existing or future competitors. Also, if consolidation of our existing competitors occurs, we would expect the competitive pressures we face to increase. Our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our customers’ businesses are generally cyclical. Weaknesses in the industries in which our customers operate could impact our revenues and profitability. The industries to which we sell tend to decline in response to overall declines in industrial production. Aerospace is heavily dependent on the commercial aerospace industry, which is cyclical and a long cycle industry. Industrial is dependent on the transportation industry, and general industrial and tooling markets, all of which are also cyclical. Many of our customers have historically experienced periodic downturns, which often have had a negative effect on demand for our products. Original equipment manufacturers in the aerospace and transportation industries have significant pricing leverage over suppliers and may be able to achieve price reductions over time. Additionally, we may not be successful in our efforts to raise prices on our customers. There is substantial and continuing pressure from OEMs in the transportation industries, including automotive and aerospace, to reduce the prices they pay to suppliers. We attempt to manage such downward pricing pressure, while trying to preserve our business relationships with our customers, by seeking to reduce our production costs through various measures, including purchasing raw materials and components at lower prices and implementing cost-effective process improvements. Our suppliers have periodically resisted, and in the future may resist, pressure to lower their prices and may seek to impose price increases. If we are unable to offset OEM price reductions, our profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, OEMs have substantial leverage in setting purchasing and payment terms, including the terms of accelerated payment programs under which payments are made prior to the account due date in return for an early payment discount. OEMs can unexpectedly change their purchasing policies or payment practices, which could have a negative impact on our short-term working capital. Demand for our defense-related products depends on government spending. A portion of Aerospace's sales is derived from the military market, including single-sourced and dual-sourced sales. The military market is largely dependent upon government budgets and is subject to governmental appropriations. Although multi-year contracts may be authorized in connection with major procurements, funds are generally appropriated on a fiscal year basis even though a program may be expected to continue for several years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded and additional funds are committed only as further appropriations are made. We cannot assure you that maintenance of or increases in defense spending will be allocated to programs that would benefit our business. Moreover, we cannot assure you that new military aircraft programs in which we participate will enter full-scale production as expected. A decrease in levels of defense spending or the government’s termination of, or failure to fully fund, one or more of the contracts for the programs in which we participate could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. 10Table of ContentsThe consolidation occurring in the industries in which we operate could adversely affect our business and financial results. The industries in which we operate have been experiencing consolidation. There has been consolidation of both suppliers and the customers we serve. Supplier consolidation is in part attributable to OEMs more frequently awarding long-term sole source or preferred supplier contracts to the most capable suppliers in an effort to reduce the total number of suppliers from whom components and systems are purchased. We cannot assure you that our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows will not be adversely impacted as a result of consolidation by our competitors or customers. The aerospace industry is highly regulated. Complications related to aerospace regulations may adversely affect the Company. A substantial portion of our income is derived from our aerospace businesses. The aerospace industry is highly regulated in the U.S. by the Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, and in other countries by similar regulatory agencies. We must be certified by these agencies and, in some cases, by individual OEMs in order to engineer and service systems and components used in specific aircraft models. If material authorizations or approvals were delayed, revoked or suspended, our business could be adversely affected. New or more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted, or industry oversight heightened, in the future, and we may incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or any heightened industry oversight. Environmental regulations impose costs and regulatory requirements on our operations. Environmental compliance may be more costly than we expect, and we may be subject to material environmental-based claims in the future. Our past and present business operations and past and present ownership and operations of real property and the use, sale, storage and handling of chemicals and hazardous products subject us to extensive and changing U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, as well as those of other countries, pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, enforcement, disposition of wastes (including hazardous wastes), the use, shipping, labeling, and storage of chemicals and hazardous materials, building requirements, or otherwise relating to protection of the environment. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations. In addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become subject to new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations. In addition, many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we monitor hazardous waste management and applicable environmental permitting and reporting for compliance with applicable laws at our locations in the ordinary course of our business. We may be subject to potential material liabilities relating to any investigation and clean-up of our locations or properties where we delivered hazardous waste for handling or disposal that may be contaminated or which may have been contaminated prior to our purchase, and to claims alleging personal injury.  Fluctuations in jet fuel and other energy prices may impact our operating results. Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of operating expenses for companies in the aerospace industry. Fluctuations in fuel costs could impact levels and frequency of aircraft maintenance and overhaul activities, and airlines' decisions on maintaining, deferring or canceling new aircraft purchases, in part based on the value associated with new fuel efficient technologies. Widespread disruption to oil production, refinery operations and pipeline capacity in certain areas of the U.S. can impact the price of jet fuel significantly. Conflicts in the Middle East, an important source of oil for the U.S. and other countries where we do business, cause prices for fuel to be volatile. Because we and many of our customers are in the aerospace industry, these fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Our products and services may be rendered obsolete by new products, technologies and processes. Our manufacturing operations focus on highly engineered components which require extensive engineering and research and development time. Our competitive advantage may be adversely impacted if we cannot continue to introduce new products ahead of our competition, or if our products are rendered obsolete by other products or by new, different technologies and processes. The success of our new products will depend on a number of factors, including innovation, customer acceptance, the efficiency of our suppliers in providing materials and component parts, and the performance and quality of our products relative to those of our competitors. We cannot predict the level of market acceptance or the amount of market share our new products will achieve. Additionally, we may face increased or unexpected costs associated with new product introduction including the use of additional resources such as personnel. We cannot assure that we will not experience new product introduction delays in the future.  11Table of ContentsRISKS RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING, ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES AND JOINT VENTURES Our acquisition and divestiture strategies and our restructuring activities may not be successful. We have made a number of acquisitions in the past and we anticipate that we may, from time to time, acquire additional businesses, assets or securities of companies that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our businesses. Acquisitions expose the Company to a number of risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of any of which could materially adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. A portion of the industries that we serve are mature industries. As a result, our future growth may depend in part on the successful acquisition and integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations. We may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions, obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms, obtain regulatory approvals or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future. We could have difficulties integrating acquired businesses with our existing operations. Difficulties of integration can include coordinating and consolidating separate systems, integrating the management of the acquired business, retaining market acceptance of acquired products and services, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees, and implementing our enterprise resource planning systems and operational procedures and disciplines. Any such difficulties may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with employees, customers, business partners and suppliers. In addition, even if integration is successful, the financial performance of acquired business may not be as expected and there can be no assurance we will realize anticipated benefits from our acquisitions. We cannot assure you that we will effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business or product offerings or realize anticipated operational synergies. In connection with the integration of acquired operations or the conduct of our overall business strategies, we may periodically restructure our businesses and/or sell assets or portions of our business. Integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies into our existing operations may result in difficulties, significant expense and accounting charges, disrupt our business or divert management’s time and attention.Acquisitions involve numerous other risks, including potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business. In connection with acquisitions or joint venture investments outside the U.S., we may enter into derivative contracts to purchase foreign currency in order to hedge against the risk of foreign currency fluctuations in connection with such acquisitions or joint venture investments, which subjects us to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations associated with such derivative contracts. Additionally, our final determinations and appraisals of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions may vary materially from earlier estimates. We cannot assure you that the fair value of acquired businesses will remain constant.We have also in the past divested assets and businesses and we may in the future seek to sell certain of our assets or businesses in order to meet our strategic objectives, and we cannot be certain that our business, operating results and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected. A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to any purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to retain, reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business, and collect the proceeds from any divestitures. In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other products offered by us. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of any divestiture transaction, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. In addition, divestitures of businesses involve a number of risks, including the diversion of management and employee attention, significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships, and a decrease in revenues and earnings associated with the divested business. Furthermore, divestitures potentially involve significant post-closing separation activities, which could involve the expenditure of material financial resources and significant employee resources. Any divestiture may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the dilutive impact from the loss of revenue associated with the divestiture, as well as significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.We may not achieve expected cost savings from restructuring activities and actual charges, costs and adjustments due to restructuring activities may vary materially from our estimates. Our ability to realize anticipated cost savings, synergies and revenue enhancements may be affected by a number of factors, including the following: our ability to effectively eliminate duplicative back office overhead and overlapping sales personnel, rationalize manufacturing capacity, synchronize information technology systems, consolidate warehousing and distribution facilities and shift production to more economical facilities; significant cash and non-cash integration and implementation costs or charges in order to achieve those cost savings, which could offset any such savings and other synergies resulting from our acquisitions or divestitures; and our ability to avoid labor disruption in connection with integration efforts or divestitures.  12Table of ContentsAny joint ventures or teaming arrangements we enter into may not be successful. We may enter into joint ventures or teaming arrangements. Partners with whom we share control may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the joint venture or arrangement. Our joint venture or teaming arrangements may require us to pay certain costs or to make certain capital investments and we may have little control over the amount or the timing of these payments and investments. In addition, our joint venture or teaming partners may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. Our failure or the failure of an entity in which we have a joint venture interest or teaming arrangement to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions, joint ventures or teaming arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We cannot assure you that any of our joint ventures or teaming arrangements will be profitable or that forecasts regarding joint venture or teaming activities will be accurate. In particular, risks and uncertainties associated with our joint ventures and teaming arrangements include, among others, the joint venture’s or teaming partner’s ability to operate its business successfully, to develop appropriate standards, controls, procedures and policies for the growth and management of the joint venture or teaming arrangement and the strength of their relationships with employees, suppliers and customers. "
12,B,BARNES GROUP INC,2014-02-25,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
 Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks. Please note that additional risks not presently known to us may also materially impact our business and operations. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS We depend on revenues and earnings from a small number of significant customers. Any bankruptcy of or loss, cancellation, reduction or delay in purchases by these customers could harm our business. In 2013, our net sales to General Electric and its subsidiaries accounted for 21% of our total sales and approximately 55% of Aerospace's net sales.  Additionally, approximately 21% of Aerospace's sales in 2013 were to its next two largest customers. Approximately 13% of Industrial's sales in 2013 were to its three largest customers. Some of our success will depend on the business strength and viability of those customers. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our largest customers. A tightening in the credit markets may affect our customers’ ability to raise debt or equity capital. This may reduce the amount of liquidity available to our customers which may limit their ability to purchase products. Some of our customers may in the future reduce their purchases due to economic conditions or shift their purchases from us to our competitors, in-house or to other sources. Some of our long-term sales agreements provide that until a firm order is placed by a customer for a particular product, the customer may unilaterally reduce or discontinue its projected purchases without penalty, or terminate for convenience. The loss of one or more of our largest customers, any reduction, cancellation or delay in sales to these customers (including a reduction in aftermarket volume in our RSPs), our inability to successfully develop relationships with new customers, or future price concessions we make to retain customers could significantly reduce our sales and profitability.  We have significant indebtedness that could affect our operations and financial condition. At December 31, 2013, we had consolidated debt obligations of $547.4 million, representing approximately 32% of our total capital (indebtedness plus stockholders’ equity) as of that date. Our level of indebtedness, proportion of variable rate debt obligations and the significant debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness may adversely affect our operations and financial condition as well as the value or trading price of our outstanding equity securities and debt securities. For example, our indebtedness could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, investments in technology and research and development, acquisitions, dividends and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industries in which we compete; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors, some of whom have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources than we do; limit our ability to borrow additional funds; or increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. In addition, conditions in the worldwide credit markets may limit our ability to expand our credit lines beyond current bank commitments.Economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Prolonged slow growth or a downturn, worsening or broadening of adverse conditions in the worldwide and domestic economies could affect purchases of our products, and create or exacerbate credit issues, cash flow issues and other financial hardships for us and for our suppliers and customers. Depending upon their severity and duration, these conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Our failure to meet certain financial covenants required by our debt agreements may materially and adversely affect our assets, financial position and cash flows. A majority of our debt arrangements require us to maintain certain debt and interest coverage ratios and limit our ability to incur debt, make investments or undertake certain other business activities. These requirements could limit our ability to obtain future financing and may prevent us from taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. Our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our debt arrangements may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the restrictions could result in an event of default under our debt arrangements which, in turn, could result in an event of default under the terms of our other indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our debt arrangements, after the expiration of any grace periods, our lenders could elect to declare all amounts  4Table of Contentsoutstanding under our debt arrangements, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to happen, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the payments due under those arrangements or our other indebtedness. Our operations depend on our manufacturing, sales, distribution and service facilities and information systems in various parts of the world which are subject to physical, financial, regulatory, environmental, operational and other risks that could disrupt our operations. We have a significant number of manufacturing facilities and technical service, sales and distribution centers outside the U.S. The international scope of our business subjects us to increased risks and uncertainties such as threats of war, terrorism and instability of governments; compliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the U.S., such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and economic, regulatory and legal systems in countries in which we or our customers conduct business. In addition, because we depend upon our information systems to help process orders, to manage inventory and accounts receivable collections, to purchase, sell and ship products efficiently and on a timely basis, to maintain cost-effective operations, and to help provide superior service to our customers, any disruption or failure in the operation of our information systems, including from conversions or integrations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Some of our facilities are located in areas that may be affected by natural disasters, including earthquakes or tsunamis, which could cause significant damage and disruption to the operations of those facilities and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, some of our manufacturing equipment and tooling is custom-made and is not readily replaceable. Loss of such equipment or tooling could have a negative impact on our manufacturing business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Although we have obtained property damage and business interruption insurance, a major catastrophe such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, tsunami or other natural disaster at any of our sites, or significant labor strikes, work stoppages, political unrest, or any of the events described above, some of which may not be covered by our insurance, in any of the areas where we conduct operations could result in a prolonged interruption of our business. Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in the manufacture or shipment of products or the provision of repair and other services that may result in our loss of sales and customers. Our insurance will not cover all potential risks, and we cannot assure you that we will have adequate insurance to compensate us for all losses that result from any insured risks. Any material loss not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We cannot assure you that insurance will be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us or at a cost that will not have a material adverse effect on our profitability, net income and cash flows.Further, in the ordinary course of our business, we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our  business operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations, and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business. The global nature of our business exposes us to foreign currency fluctuations that may affect our future revenues, debt levels and profitability. We have manufacturing facilities and technical service, sales and distribution centers around the world, and the majority of our foreign operations use the local currency as their functional currency. These include, among others, the Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, Euro, Japanese yen, Korean won, Mexican peso, Singapore dollar, Swedish krona, Swiss franc and Thai baht. Since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies expose us to translation risk when the local currency financial statements are translated to U.S. dollars. Changes in currency exchange rates may also expose us to transaction risk. We may buy protecting or offsetting positions or hedges in certain currencies to reduce our exposure to currency exchange fluctuations; however, these transactions may not be adequate or effective to protect us from the exposure for which they are purchased. We have not engaged in any speculative hedging activities. Currency fluctuations may impact our revenues and profitability in the future. The global nature of our operations and assets subject us to additional financial and regulatory risks. We have operations and assets in various parts of the world. In addition, we sell or may in the future sell our products and services to the U.S. and foreign governments and in foreign countries. Accordingly, we are subject to various risks, including: U.S. imposed embargoes of sales to specific countries; foreign import controls (which may be arbitrarily imposed or enforced); import regulations and duties; export regulations (which require us to comply with stringent licensing regimes); anti-dumping regulations; price and currency controls; exchange rate fluctuations; dividend remittance restrictions; expropriation of assets;  5Table of Contentswar, civil uprisings and riots; government instability; government contracting requirements including cost accounting standards, including various procurement, security, and audit requirements, as well as requirements to certify to the government compliance with these requirements; the necessity of obtaining governmental approval for new and continuing products and operations; legal systems or decrees, laws, taxes, regulations, interpretations and court decisions that are not always fully developed and that may be retroactively or arbitrarily applied; and difficulties in managing a global enterprise. We have experienced inadvertent violations of some of these regulations, including export regulations, safety regulations, regulations prohibiting sales of certain products and product labeling regulations, in the past, none of which has had or, we believe, will have a material adverse effect on our business. However, any significant violations of these or other regulations in the future could result in civil or criminal sanctions, and the loss of export or other licenses which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may also be subject to unanticipated income taxes, excise duties, import taxes, export taxes, value added taxes, or other governmental assessments, and taxes may be impacted by changes in legislation in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, our organizational and capital structure may limit our ability to transfer funds between countries, particularly into the U.S., without incurring adverse tax consequences. Any of these events could result in a loss of business or other unexpected costs that could reduce sales or profits and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our ability to recover deferred tax assets depends on future income. From time to time, we may have significant deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income.  In the event we do not generate sufficient taxable income, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.     Changes in the availability or price of materials, products and energy resources could adversely affect our costs and profitability. We may be adversely affected by the availability or price of raw materials, products and energy resources, particularly related to certain manufacturing operations that utilize steel, stainless steel, titanium, Inconel, Hastelloys and other specialty materials. The availability and price of raw materials and energy resources may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, new laws or regulations, global economic or political events including strikes, terrorist attacks and war, suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. In some instances there are limited sources for raw materials and a limited number of primary suppliers for some of our products for resale. Although we are not dependent upon any single source for any of our principal raw materials or products for resale, and such materials and products have, historically, been readily available, we cannot assure you that such raw materials and products will continue to be readily available. Disruption in the supply of raw materials, products or energy resources or our inability to come to favorable agreements with our suppliers could impair our ability to manufacture, sell and deliver our products and require us to pay higher prices. Any increase in prices for such raw materials, products or energy resources could materially adversely affect our costs and our profitability. Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") established disclosure and reporting requirements regarding the use of “conflict” minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. These requirements could adversely affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of certain of our products. As a result, we may not be able to obtain certain materials or products at competitive prices. We may also incur costs to comply with these new requirements, including for due diligence regarding the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products. Further, we may face reputational risk and other challenges with our customers and suppliers if we are unable to verify sufficiently that the minerals used in our products are conflict free. We maintain pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the U.S. and certain international locations. Our costs of providing defined benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on the plans’ assets, exchange rate fluctuations, future governmental regulation, global equity prices, and our required and/or voluntary contributions to the plans. Declines in the stock market, prevailing interest rates, declines in discount rates and rising medical costs may cause an increase in our pension and other postretirement benefit expenses in the future and result in reductions in our pension fund asset values and increases in our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. These changes have caused and may continue to cause a significant reduction in our net worth and without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans’ assets, and depending upon the other factors listed above, we could be required to increase funding for some or all of these pension and postretirement plans. Our cash is highly concentrated with certain financial institutions.  At various times we have a concentration of cash in accounts with financial institutions in the U.S. and around the globe.  Our holdings in certain of these institutions significantly exceeded the insured limits of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or their equivalent outside the U.S. at December 31, 2013. 6Table of ContentsWe carry significant inventories and a loss in net realizable value could cause a decline in our net worth. At December 31, 2013, our inventories totaled $211.2 million. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market based on management's judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels, quantities and prices at which such inventories will be sold in the normal course of business. Accelerating the disposal process or incorrect estimates of future sales potential may necessitate future reduction to inventory values. The Company's inventories include certain parts related to specific engines within the aftermarket repair and overhaul business. The demand for these parts and our ability to utilize these parts depends on the frequency and scope of repair and maintenance of aircraft engines and our ability to effectively access that market. See “Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies”.  We have significant goodwill and an impairment of our goodwill could cause a decline in our net worth. Our total assets include substantial goodwill. At December 31, 2013, our goodwill totaled $649.7 million. The goodwill results from our prior acquisitions, representing the excess of the purchase price we paid over the net assets of the companies acquired. We assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill during each calendar year or sooner if triggering events warrant. If future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units does not meet expectations or fair values fall due to significant stock market declines, we may be required to reflect a non-cash charge to operating results for goodwill impairment. The recognition of an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material. See “Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies”.  We could be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. Our profitability may be adversely affected as a result of increases in interest rates. At December 31, 2013, we and our subsidiaries had approximately $547.4 million aggregate principal amount of consolidated debt obligations outstanding, of which approximately 71% had interest rates that float with the market. A 100 basis point increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in effect at December 31, 2013 would have resulted in an approximate $3.8 million annualized increase in interest expense. We may not realize all of the sales expected from our existing backlog or anticipated orders. At December 31, 2013, we had $757.8 million of order backlog, the majority of which related to aerospace OEM customers. There can be no assurances that the revenues projected in our backlog will be realized or, if realized, will result in profits. We consider backlog to be firm customer orders for future delivery. From time to time, OEM customers provide projections of components and assemblies that they anticipate purchasing in the future under new and existing programs. Such projections are not included in our backlog unless we have received a firm order from our customers. Our customers may have the right under certain circumstances or with certain penalties or consequences to terminate, reduce or defer firm orders that we have in backlog. If our customers terminate, reduce or defer firm orders, we may be protected from certain costs and losses, but our sales will nevertheless be adversely affected. Although we strive to maintain ongoing relationships with our customers, there is an ongoing risk that orders may be cancelled or rescheduled due to fluctuations in our customers’ business needs or purchasing budgets. Also, our realization of sales from new and existing programs is inherently subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties, including whether our customers execute the launch of product programs on time, or at all, the number of units that our customers actually produce, the timing of production and manufacturing insourcing decisions made by our customers. In addition, until firm orders are placed, our customers generally have the right to discontinue a program or replace us with another supplier at any time without penalty. Our failure to realize sales from new and existing programs could have a material adverse effect on our net sales, results of operations and cash flows.We may not recover all of our up-front costs related to new or existing programs. New programs may require significant up-front investments for capital equipment, engineering, inventory, design and tooling. As OEMs in the transportation and aerospace industries have looked to suppliers to bear increasing responsibility for the design, engineering and manufacture of systems and components, they have increasingly shifted the financial risk associated with those responsibilities to the suppliers as well. This trend is likely to continue and is most evident in the area of engineering cost reimbursement. We cannot assure you that we will have adequate funds to make such up-front investments or to recover such costs from our customers as part of our product pricing. In the event that we are unable to make such investments, or to recover them through sales or direct reimbursement from our customers, our profitability, liquidity and cash flows may be adversely affected. In addition, we incur costs and make capital expenditures for new program awards based upon certain estimates of production volumes and production complexity. While we attempt to recover such costs and capital expenditures by appropriately pricing our products, the prices of our products are based in part upon planned production volumes. If the actual production is significantly less than planned or significantly more complex than anticipated, we may be unable to recover such costs. In addition, because a significant portion of our overall costs is fixed, declines in our customers’ production levels can adversely affect the level of our reported profits even if our up-front investments are recovered.  7Table of ContentsWe may not realize all of the intangible assets related to the Aerospace aftermarket businesses. Our total investments in participation fees under our Revenue Sharing Programs (RSPs) as of December 31, 2013 equaled $293.7 million, all of which have been paid. At December 31, 2013, the remaining unamortized balance of these participation fees was $229.5 million. We participate in aftermarket RSPs under which we receive an exclusive right to supply designated aftermarket parts over the life of the related aircraft engine program to our customer, General Electric. As consideration, we pay participation fees, which are recorded as intangible assets and are recognized as a reduction of sales over the estimated useful life of the related engine programs which range up to 30 years.During the fourth quarter of 2013, we entered into a Component Repair Program (""CRP""), also with General Electric.  The CRP provides for, among other items, the extension of contracts under which the Company currently provides certain aftermarket component repair services for the CF6 and LM engine programs and the right to sell these services directly to other customers as one of a few General Electric licensed suppliers.  The Company has agreed to make a $26.6 million payment as consideration for these rights (""CRP Payment""). The Company has recorded the CRP payment as an intangible asset which is recognized as a reduction of sales over the remaining useful life of these engine programs.The realizability of each asset is dependent upon future revenues related to the program’s aftermarket parts and services and is subject to impairment testing if circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. The potential exists that actual revenues will not meet expectations due to a change in market conditions, including, for example, the replacement of older engines with new, more fuel-efficient engines or our ability to capture additional market share within the aftermarket business. A shortfall in future revenues may result in the failure to realize the net amount of the investments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, future growth and profitability could be impacted by the amortization of the participation fees and licenses, and the expiration of the international tax incentives on these programs.  We face risks of cost overruns and losses on fixed-price contracts. We sell certain of our products under firm, fixed-price contracts providing for a fixed price for the products regardless of the production or purchase costs incurred by us. The cost of producing products may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, outside processing, overhead and other factors, including manufacturing inefficiencies. Increased production costs may result in cost overruns and losses on contracts. The departure of existing management and key personnel, a shortage of skilled employees or a lack of qualified sales professionals could materially affect our business, operations and prospects. Our executive officers are important to the management and direction of our business. Our future success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain or replace these officers and other capable management personnel. Although we believe we will be able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should the need arise, our inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Because of the complex nature of many of our products and services, we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilled workforce, including, for example, our engineering talent. In addition, there are significant costs associated with the hiring and training of sales professionals. We could be adversely affected by a shortage of available skilled employees or the loss of a significant number of our sales professionals. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights effectively, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We own or are licensed under various intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks and trade secrets. Our intellectual property rights may expire or be challenged, invalidated or infringed upon by third parties. Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage, adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position, financial condition and results of operations.Any product liability, warranty, contractual or other claims in excess of insurance may adversely affect our financial condition. Our operations expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of our products and the products we buy from third parties and sell to our customers, or to potential warranty, contractual or other claims. For example, we may be exposed to potential liability for personal injury, property damage or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component designed, manufactured or sold by us, or the failure of an aircraft component that has been serviced by us or of the components themselves. While we have liability insurance for certain risks, our insurance may not cover all liabilities. Additionally, insurance coverage may not be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us. Any material liability not covered by insurance or for which third-party indemnification is not available for the full amount of the loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 8Table of ContentsFrom time to time, we receive product warranty claims, under which we may be required to bear costs of repair or replacement of certain of our products. Warranty claims may range from individual customer claims to full recalls of all products in the field. We vigorously defend ourselves in connection with these matters. We cannot, however, assure you that the costs, charges and liabilities associated with these matters will not be material, or that those costs, charges and liabilities will not exceed any amounts reserved for them in our consolidated financial statements. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted by strikes or work stoppages. Approximately 18% of our U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and more than 50% of our non-U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or statutory trade union agreements. In 2014, we are scheduled to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement with unionized employees at our Bristol, CT, Corry, PA, and Saline, MI locations, which collectively covers approximately 275 employees. In addition, we have annual negotiations in Brazil and Mexico and, collectively, these negotiations cover approximately 300 employees in those two countries. We also expect to have negotiations in 2014 with two of our German locations, a Singapore location, and our Sweden location, which collectively cover over 500 employees. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are good, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements or that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor, including healthcare, pensions or other benefits. Any potential strikes or work stoppages, and the resulting adverse impact on our relationships with customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Similarly, a protracted strike or work stoppage at any of our major customers, suppliers or other vendors could materially adversely affect our business.Changes in accounting guidance and taxation requirements could affect our financial results. New accounting guidance that may become applicable to us from time to time, or changes in the interpretations of existing guidance, could have a significant effect on our reported results for the affected periods. In addition, our products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions in which we operate. Increases in indirect taxes could affect our products’ affordability and therefore reduce our sales. We are also subject to income tax in numerous jurisdictions in which we generate revenues. Changes in tax laws, tax rates or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. Among other things, our tax liabilities are affected by the mix of pretax income or loss among the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and the repatriation of foreign earnings to the U.S. We must exercise judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes, interest and penalties; accordingly, future events could change management’s assessment of these amounts. RISKS RELATED TO THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE A general economic downturn could adversely affect our business and financial results. All of our businesses are impacted by the health of the economies in which they operate. A decline in economies in which we operate could reduce demand for our products and services or increase pricing pressures, thereby having an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We derive a large portion of our sales from the transportation industry. The operation of our business within that industry subjects us to the pressures applicable to all companies operating in it, including unfavorable pricing pressures. While the precise effects of instability in the transportation industry are difficult to determine, they may negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We operate in very competitive markets. We may not be able to compete effectively with our competitors, and competitive pressures could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our two global business segments compete with a number of larger and smaller companies in the markets we serve. Some of our competitors have greater financial, production, research and development, or other resources than we do. Within Aerospace, certain of our OEM customers compete with our repair and overhaul business. Some of our OEM customers in the aerospace industry also compete with us where they have the ability to manufacture the components and assemblies that we supply to them but have chosen, for capacity limitations, cost considerations or other reasons, to outsource the manufacturing to us. Our two business segments compete on the basis of price, service, quality, reliability of supply, technology, innovation and design. We must continue to make investments to maintain and improve our competitive position. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or that we will be successful in maintaining our competitive position. Our competitors may develop products or services, or methods of delivering those products or services that are superior to our products, services or methods. Our competitors may also adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. Pricing pressures could cause us to adjust the prices of certain of our products to stay competitive. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with our existing or future competitors. Also, if consolidation of our existing competitors occurs, we would expect the competitive pressures we face to increase. Our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our customers’ businesses are generally cyclical. Weaknesses in the industries in which our customers operate could impact our revenues and profitability. The industries to which we sell tend to decline in response to overall declines in industrial production. Aerospace is heavily dependent on the commercial aerospace industry, which is cyclical and a long cycle  9Table of Contentsindustry. Industrial is dependent on the transportation industry, and general industrial and tooling markets, all of which are also cyclical. Many of our customers have historically experienced periodic downturns, which often have had a negative effect on demand for our products. Original equipment manufacturers in the aerospace and transportation industries have significant pricing leverage over suppliers and may be able to achieve price reductions over time. Additionally, we may not be successful in our efforts to raise prices on our customers. There is substantial and continuing pressure from OEMs in the transportation industries, including automotive and aerospace, to reduce the prices they pay to suppliers. We attempt to manage such downward pricing pressure, while trying to preserve our business relationships with our customers, by seeking to reduce our production costs through various measures, including purchasing raw materials and components at lower prices and implementing cost-effective process improvements. Our suppliers have periodically resisted, and in the future may resist, pressure to lower their prices and may seek to impose price increases. If we are unable to offset OEM price reductions, our profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, OEMs have substantial leverage in setting purchasing and payment terms, including the terms of accelerated payment programs under which payments are made prior to the account due date in return for an early payment discount. OEMs can unexpectedly change their purchasing policies or payment practices, which could have a negative impact on our short-term working capital. Demand for our defense-related products depends on government spending. A portion of Aerospace's sales are derived from the military market, including single-sourced and dual-sourced sales. The military market is largely dependent upon government budgets and is subject to governmental appropriations. Although multi-year contracts may be authorized in connection with major procurements, funds are generally appropriated on a fiscal year basis even though a program may be expected to continue for several years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded and additional funds are committed only as further appropriations are made. We cannot assure you that maintenance of or increases in defense spending will be allocated to programs that would benefit our business. Moreover, we cannot assure you that new military aircraft programs in which we participate will enter full-scale production as expected. A decrease in levels of defense spending or the government’s termination of, or failure to fully fund, one or more of the contracts for the programs in which we participate could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.The consolidation occurring in the industries in which we operate could adversely affect our business and financial results. The industries in which we operate have been experiencing consolidation. There has been consolidation of both suppliers and the customers we serve. Supplier consolidation is in part attributable to OEMs more frequently awarding long-term sole source or preferred supplier contracts to the most capable suppliers in an effort to reduce the total number of suppliers from whom components and systems are purchased. We cannot assure you that our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows will not be adversely impacted as a result of consolidation by our competitors or customers. The aerospace industry is highly regulated. Complications related to aerospace regulations may adversely affect the Company. A substantial portion of our income is derived from our aerospace businesses. The aerospace industry is highly regulated in the U.S. by the Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, and in other countries by similar regulatory agencies. We must be certified by these agencies and, in some cases, by individual OEMs in order to engineer and service systems and components used in specific aircraft models. If material authorizations or approvals were delayed, revoked or suspended, our business could be adversely affected. New or more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted, or industry oversight heightened, in the future, and we may incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or any heightened industry oversight. Environmental regulations impose costs and regulatory requirements on our operations. Environmental compliance may be more costly than we expect, and we may be subject to material environmental-based claims in the future. Our past and present business operations and past and present ownership and operations of real property and the use, sale, storage and handling of chemicals and hazardous products subject us to extensive and changing U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, as well as those of other countries, pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, enforcement, disposition of wastes (including hazardous wastes), the use, shipping, labeling, and storage of chemicals and hazardous materials, building requirements, or otherwise relating to protection of the environment. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations. In addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become subject to new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations. In addition, many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we monitor hazardous waste management and applicable environmental permitting and reporting for compliance with applicable laws at our locations in the ordinary course of our business. We may be subject to potential material liabilities relating to any investigation and clean-up of our locations or  10Table of Contentsproperties where we delivered hazardous waste for handling or disposal that may be contaminated or which may have been contaminated prior to our purchase, and to claims alleging personal injury. High jet fuel and other energy prices may impact our operating results. Rising energy costs generally impact the cost of our operations, and could result in higher transportation, freight and other operating costs. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to pass along energy costs to our customers through increased prices. Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of operating expenses for companies in the aerospace industry. Widespread disruption to oil production, refinery operations and pipeline capacity in certain areas of the U.S. can increase the price of jet fuel significantly. Conflicts in the Middle East, an important source of oil for the U.S. and other countries where we do business, cause prices for fuel to be volatile and often significantly higher than historic levels. Because we and many of our customers are in the aerospace industry, increased fuel costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Our products and services may be rendered obsolete by new products, technologies and processes. Our manufacturing operations focus on highly engineered components which require extensive engineering and research and development time. Our competitive advantage may be adversely impacted if we cannot continue to introduce new products ahead of our competition, or if our products are rendered obsolete by other products or by new, different technologies and processes. The success of our new products will depend on a number of factors, including innovation, customer acceptance, the efficiency of our suppliers in providing materials and component parts, and the performance and quality of our products relative to those of our competitors. We cannot predict the level of market acceptance or the amount of market share our new products will achieve. Additionally, we may face increased or unexpected costs associated with new product introduction including the use of additional resources such as personnel. We cannot assure that we will not experience new product introduction delays in the future. RISKS RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING, ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES AND JOINT VENTURES Our acquisition and divestiture strategies and our restructuring activities may not be successful. We have made a number of acquisitions in the past and we anticipate that we may, from time to time, acquire additional businesses, assets or securities of companies that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our businesses. A significant portion of the industries that we serve are mature industries. As a result, our future growth may depend in part on the successful acquisition and integration of businesses into our existing operations. We may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions, obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms, obtain regulatory approvals or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future. We have also in the past divested assets and businesses. We may in the future engage in discussions with potential acquirers of certain of our assets or businesses in order to meet our strategic objectives, but we cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in finding suitable purchasers for any such desired sale of such assets or businesses. We will need to integrate any acquired businesses with our existing operations. We cannot assure you that we will effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business or product offerings or realize anticipated operational synergies. In connection with the integration of acquired operations or the conduct of our overall business strategies, we may periodically restructure our businesses and/or sell assets or portions of our business. Integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies into our existing operations may result in difficulties, significant expense and accounting charges, disrupt our business or divert management’s time and attention. Acquisitions involve numerous other risks, including potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business. In connection with acquisitions or joint venture investments outside the U.S., we may enter into derivative contracts to purchase foreign currency in order to hedge against the risk of foreign currency fluctuations in connection with such acquisitions or joint venture investments, which subjects us to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations associated with such derivative contracts. Additionally, our final determinations and appraisals of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions may vary materially from earlier estimates. We cannot assure you that the fair value of acquired businesses will remain constant.The acquisition of the Männer Business exposes the Company to a number of risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of any of which could materially adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations as well as the market price of our common stock. Such risks and uncertainties include risks relating to the integration of the Männer Business with the Company, the financial performance of the Männer Business and risks associated with incurring additional indebtedness. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of the Männer Business acquisition. Our ability to realize such benefits will depend on our ability to successfully and efficiently integrate Männer's business, which involves certain products and services and markets that are new to the Company, into our business, in addition to an increased scale of our international operations.  11Table of ContentsDifficulties of integration could include coordinating and consolidating separate systems, integrating the management of the acquired business, retaining market acceptance of Männer's products and services, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees, and implementing our enterprise resource planning systems and operational procedures and disciplines. Any such difficulties may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with employees, customers, business partners and suppliers. In addition, even if integration is successful, the financial performance of the acquired business may not be as expected and there can be no assurance we will realize anticipated benefits from the Männer Business acquisition. In addition, our management has spent, and expects to continue to spend, a significant amount of its time and efforts directed toward the integration of the Männer Business, which time and efforts otherwise could have been spent on our other businesses and other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us. Finally, we have incurred a substantial amount of additional indebtedness which could have an adverse effect on our financial health and make it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing in the future. The additional debt we incurred to fund the acquisition purchase price may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and may limit our ability to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, future acquisitions, debt service requirements or other purposes. Additionally, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to meet these additional debt obligations. Any default under the Credit Agreement could result in the acceleration of the repayment obligations to our lenders, as well as the acceleration of all of our outstanding debt. The realization of any of the foregoing risks may materially adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations or the market price of our common stock. In accordance with applicable SEC guidance, management's report on internal control over financial reporting excludes the assessment of the Männer Business. We plan to fully evaluate the internal controls of the Männer Business and any subsequently acquired companies, then implement a standardized framework of internal controls at those acquired businesses. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to provide a report that contains no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses with respect to the Männer Business or any other acquisitions. If we engage in a divestiture of assets or a business, we cannot be certain that our business, operating results and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected. A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to any purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to retain, reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business, and collect the proceeds from any divestitures. In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other products offered by us. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of any divestiture transaction, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. In addition, divestitures of businesses involve a number of risks, including the diversion of management and employee attention, significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships, and a decrease in revenues and earnings associated with the divested business. Furthermore, divestitures potentially involve significant post-closing separation activities, which could involve the expenditure of material financial resources and significant employee resources. Any divestiture may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the dilutive impact from the loss of revenue associated with the divestiture, as well as significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.We may not achieve expected cost savings from restructuring activities and actual charges, costs and adjustments due to restructuring activities may vary materially from our estimates. Our ability to realize anticipated cost savings, synergies and revenue enhancements may be affected by a number of factors, including the following: our ability to effectively eliminate duplicative back office overhead and overlapping sales personnel, rationalize manufacturing capacity, synchronize information technology systems, consolidate warehousing and distribution facilities and shift production to more economical facilities; significant cash and non-cash integration and implementation costs or charges in order to achieve those cost savings, which could offset any such savings and other synergies resulting from our acquisitions or divestitures; and our ability to avoid labor disruption in connection with integration efforts or divestitures. Any joint ventures or teaming arrangements we enter into may not be successful. We may enter into joint ventures or teaming arrangements. Partners with whom we share control may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the joint venture or arrangement. Our joint venture or teaming arrangements may require us to pay certain costs or to make certain capital investments and we may have little control over the amount or the timing of these payments and investments. In addition, our joint venture or teaming partners may be unable to  12Table of Contentsmeet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. Our failure or the failure of an entity in which we have a joint venture interest or teaming arrangement to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions, joint ventures or teaming arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We cannot assure you that any of our joint ventures or teaming arrangements will be profitable or that forecasts regarding joint venture or teaming activities will be accurate. In particular, risks and uncertainties associated with our joint ventures and teaming arrangements include, among others, the joint venture’s or teaming partner’s ability to operate its business successfully, to develop appropriate standards, controls, procedures and policies for the growth and management of the joint venture or teaming arrangement and the strength of their relationships with employees, suppliers and customers. "
15,B,BARNES GROUP INC,2013-02-25,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
 Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks. Please note that additional risks not presently known to us may also materially impact our business and operations. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS We depend on revenues and earnings from a small number of significant customers. Any bankruptcy of or loss, cancellation, reduction or delay in purchases by these customers could harm our business. In 2012, our net sales to General Electric and its subsidiaries accounted for 17% of our total sales and approximately 54% of Aerospace's net sales.  Additionally, approximately 19% of Aerospace's sales in 2012 were to its next two largest customers. Approximately 17% of Industrial's sales in 2012 were to its three largest customers. Some of our success will depend on the business strength and viability of those customers. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our largest customers. A tightening in the credit markets may affect our customers’ ability to raise debt or equity capital. This may reduce the amount of liquidity available to our customers which may limit their ability to purchase products. Some of our customers may in the future reduce their purchases due to economic conditions or shift their purchases from us to our competitors, in-house or to other sources. Some of our long-term sales agreements provide that until a firm order is placed by a customer for a particular product, the customer may unilaterally reduce or discontinue its projected purchases without penalty, or terminate for convenience. The loss of one or more of our largest customers, any reduction, cancellation or delay in sales to these customers (including a reduction in aftermarket volume in our RSPs), our inability to successfully develop relationships with new customers, or future price concessions we make to retain customers could significantly reduce our sales and profitability.  We have significant indebtedness that could affect our operations and financial condition. At December 31, 2012, we had consolidated debt obligations of $646.6 million, representing approximately 45% of our total capital (indebtedness plus stockholders’ equity) as of that date. Our level of indebtedness, proportion of variable rate debt obligations and the significant debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness may adversely affect our operations and financial condition as well as the value or trading price of our outstanding equity securities and debt securities. For example, our indebtedness could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, investments in technology and research and development, acquisitions, dividends and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industries in which we compete; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors, some of whom have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources than we do; limit our ability to borrow additional funds; or increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. In addition, conditions in the worldwide credit markets may limit our ability to expand our credit lines beyond current bank commitments.Economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Prolonged slow growth or a downturn, worsening or broadening of adverse conditions in the worldwide and domestic economies could affect purchases of our products, and create or exacerbate credit issues, cash flow issues and other financial hardships for us and for our suppliers and customers. Depending upon their severity and duration, these conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Our failure to meet certain financial covenants required by our debt agreements may materially and adversely affect our assets, financial position and cash flows. A majority of our debt arrangements require us to maintain certain debt and interest coverage ratios and limit our ability to incur debt, make investments or undertake certain other business activities. These requirements could limit our ability to obtain future financing and may prevent us from taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. Our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our debt arrangements may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the restrictions could result in an event of default under our debt arrangements which, in turn, could result in an event of default under the terms of our other indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our debt arrangements, after the expiration of any grace periods, our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our debt arrangements, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to happen, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the payments due under those arrangements or 4Table of Contentsour other indebtedness. Our operations depend on our manufacturing, distribution, sales, service facilities and information systems in various parts of the world which are subject to physical, financial, regulatory, environmental, operational and other risks that could disrupt our operations. We have a significant number of manufacturing facilities and distribution, technical service and sales centers outside the U.S. The international scope of our business subjects us to increased risks and uncertainties such as threats of war, terrorism and instability of governments; compliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the U.S., such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and economic, regulatory and legal systems in countries in which we or our customers conduct business. In addition, because we depend upon our information systems to help process orders, to manage inventory and accounts receivable collections, to purchase, sell and ship products efficiently and on a timely basis, to maintain cost-effective operations, and to help provide superior service to our customers, any disruption or failure in the operation of our information systems, including from conversions or integrations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Some of our facilities are located in areas that may be affected by natural disasters, including earthquakes or tsunamis, which could cause significant damage and disruption to the operations of those facilities and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, some of our manufacturing equipment and tooling is custom-made and is not readily replaceable. Loss of such equipment or tooling could have a negative impact on our manufacturing business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Although we have obtained property damage and business interruption insurance, a major catastrophe such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, tsunami or other natural disaster at any of our sites, or significant labor strikes, work stoppages, political unrest, or any of the events described above, some of which may not be covered by our insurance, in any of the areas where we conduct operations could result in a prolonged interruption of our business. Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in the manufacture or shipment of products or the provision of repair and other services that may result in our loss of sales and customers. Our insurance will not cover all potential risks, and we cannot assure you that we will have adequate insurance to compensate us for all losses that result from any insured risks. Any material loss not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We cannot assure you that insurance will be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us or at a cost that will not have a material adverse effect on our profitability, net income and cash flows.Further, in the ordinary course of our business, we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our  business operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations, and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business. The global nature of our business exposes us to foreign currency fluctuations that may affect our future revenues and profitability. We have manufacturing facilities and distribution, technical service and sales centers around the world, and the majority of our foreign operations use the local currency as their functional currency. These include, among others, the Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, Euro, Korean won, Mexican peso, Singapore dollar, Swedish krona, Swiss franc and Thai baht. Since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies expose us to translation risk when the local currency financial statements are translated to U.S. dollars. Changes in currency exchange rates may also expose us to transaction risk. We may buy protecting or offsetting positions or hedges in certain currencies to reduce our exposure to currency exchange fluctuations; however, these transactions may not be adequate or effective to protect us from the exposure for which they are purchased. We have not engaged in any speculative hedging activities. Currency fluctuations may impact our revenues and profitability in the future. Our operations and assets subject us to additional financial and regulatory risks. We have operations and assets in various parts of the world. In addition, we sell or may in the future sell our products and services to the U.S. and foreign governments and in foreign countries. Accordingly, we are subject to various risks, including: U.S. imposed embargoes of sales to specific countries; foreign import controls (which may be arbitrarily imposed or enforced); import regulations and duties; export regulations (which require us to comply with stringent licensing regimes); anti-dumping regulations; price and currency controls; exchange rate fluctuations; dividend remittance restrictions; expropriation of assets; war, civil uprisings and riots; government instability; government contracting requirements including cost accounting standards, including various procurement, security, and audit requirements, as well as requirements to certify to the government compliance with these 5Table of Contentsrequirements; the necessity of obtaining governmental approval for new and continuing products and operations; legal systems or decrees, laws, taxes, regulations, interpretations and court decisions that are not always fully developed and that may be retroactively or arbitrarily applied; and difficulties in managing a global enterprise. We have experienced inadvertent violations of some of these regulations, including export regulations, safety regulations, regulations prohibiting sales of certain products, product labeling regulations, and regulations prohibiting air transport of aerosol products, in the past, none of which has had or, we believe, will have a material adverse effect on our business. However, any significant violations of these or other regulations in the future could result in civil or criminal sanctions, and the loss of export or other licenses which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may also be subject to unanticipated income taxes, excise duties, import taxes, export taxes, value added taxes, or other governmental assessments, and taxes may be impacted by changes in legislation in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, our organizational and capital structure may limit our ability to transfer funds between countries, particularly into the U.S., without incurring adverse tax consequences. Any of these events could result in a loss of business or other unexpected costs that could reduce sales or profits and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our ability to recover our significant deferred tax assets related to tax operating loss carryforwards depends on future income. We have significant deferred tax assets related to operating loss carryforwards. The realization of these assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S. during the operating loss carryforward period. Failure to realize this tax benefit could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in the availability or price of materials, products and energy resources could adversely affect our costs and profitability. We may be adversely affected by the availability or price of raw materials, products and energy resources, particularly related to certain manufacturing operations that utilize high-grade steel spring wire, stainless steel, titanium and inconel. The availability and price of raw materials and energy resources may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, new laws or regulations, global economic or political events including strikes, terrorist attacks and war, suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. In some instances there are limited sources for raw materials and a limited number of primary suppliers for some of our products for resale. Although we are not dependent upon any single source for any of our principal raw materials or products for resale, and such materials and products have, historically, been readily available, we cannot assure you that such raw materials and products will continue to be readily available. Disruption in the supply of raw materials, products or energy resources or our inability to come to favorable agreements with our suppliers could impair our ability to manufacture, sell and deliver our products and require us to pay higher prices. Any increase in prices for such raw materials, products or energy resources could materially adversely affect our costs and our profitability. Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") established disclosure and reporting requirements regarding the use of “conflict” minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. These requirements could adversely affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of certain of our products. As a result, we may not be able to obtain certain materials or products at competitive prices. We may also incur costs to comply with these new requirements, including for due diligence regarding the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products. Further, we may face reputational risk and other challenges with our customers and suppliers if we are unable to verify sufficiently that the minerals used in our products are conflict free. We maintain pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the U.S. and certain international locations. Our costs of providing defined benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on the plans’ assets, exchange rate fluctuations, future governmental regulation, global equity prices, and our required and/or voluntary contributions to the plans. Declines in the stock market, prevailing interest rates, declines in discount rates and rising medical costs may cause an increase in our pension and other postretirement benefit expenses in the future and result in reductions in our pension fund asset values and increases in our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. These changes have caused and may continue to cause a significant reduction in our net worth and without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans’ assets, and depending upon the other factors listed above, we could be required to increase funding for some or all of these pension and postretirement plans. Also, we may be subject to significant withdrawal liability assessments if we withdraw from a multi-employer pension plan in which we participate. See Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.Our cash is highly concentrated with certain financial institutions.  At various times we have a concentration of cash in accounts with financial institutions in the U.S. and around the globe.  Our holdings in certain of these institutions significantly exceeded the insured limits of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or their equivalent outside the U.S. at December 31, 2012.We carry significant inventories and a loss in net realizable value could cause a decline in our net worth. At December 31, 2012, our inventories totaled $226.2 million.  Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market based on 6Table of Contentsmanagements' judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels, quantities and prices at which such inventories will be sold in the normal course of business. Accelerating the disposal process or incorrect estimates of future sales potential may necessitate future reduction to inventory values. The Company's inventories include specialty spare parts for the aerospace market. The demand for these spare parts and our ability to utilize these parts depends on the frequency and scope of repair and maintenance of aircraft engines and our ability to effectively access that market.  See “Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies” beginning on page 29.  We have significant goodwill and an impairment of our goodwill could cause a decline in our net worth. Our total assets include substantial goodwill. At December 31, 2012, our goodwill totaled $579.9 million. The goodwill results from our prior acquisitions, representing the excess of the purchase price we paid over the net assets of the companies acquired. We assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill during each calendar year or sooner if triggering events warrant. If future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units does not meet expectations or fair values fall due to significant stock market declines, we may be required to reflect a non-cash charge to operating results for goodwill impairment. The recognition of an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material. See “Part II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies” beginning on page 29.  We could be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. Our profitability may be adversely affected as a result of increases in interest rates. At December 31, 2012, we and our subsidiaries had approximately $646.6 million aggregate principal amount of consolidated debt obligations outstanding, of which approximately 76% had interest rates that float with the market. A 100 basis point increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in effect at December 31, 2012 would have resulted in an approximate $4.3 million annualized increase in interest expense. We may not realize all of the sales expected from our existing backlog or anticipated orders. At December 31, 2012, we had $676.9 million of order backlog, the majority of which related to aerospace OEM customers. There can be no assurances that the revenues projected in our backlog will be realized or, if realized, will result in profits. We consider backlog to be firm customer orders for future delivery. From time to time, OEM customers of Aerospace and Industrial provide projections of components and assemblies that they anticipate purchasing in the future under new and existing programs. Such projections are not included in our backlog unless we have received a firm order from our customers. Our customers may have the right under certain circumstances or with certain penalties or consequences to terminate, reduce or defer firm orders that we have in backlog. If our customers terminate, reduce or defer firm orders, we may be protected from certain costs and losses, but our sales will nevertheless be adversely affected. Although we strive to maintain ongoing relationships with our customers, there is an ongoing risk that orders may be cancelled or rescheduled due to fluctuations in our customers’ business needs or purchasing budgets. Also, our realization of sales from new and existing programs is inherently subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties, including whether our customers execute the launch of product programs on time, or at all, the number of units that our customers actually produce, the timing of production and manufacturing insourcing decisions made by our customers. In addition, until firm orders are placed, our customers generally have the right to discontinue a program or replace us with another supplier at any time without penalty. Our failure to realize sales from new and existing programs could have a material adverse effect on our net sales, results of operations and cash flows.We may not recover all of our up-front costs related to new or existing programs. New programs require significant up-front investments for capital equipment, engineering, inventory, design and tooling. As OEMs in the transportation and aerospace industries have looked to suppliers to bear increasing responsibility for the design, engineering and manufacture of systems and components, they have increasingly shifted the financial risk associated with those responsibilities to the suppliers as well. This trend is likely to continue and is most evident in the area of engineering cost reimbursement. We cannot assure you that we will have adequate funds to make such up-front investments or to recover such costs from our customers as part of our product pricing. In the event that we are unable to make such investments, or to recover them through sales or direct reimbursement from our customers, our profitability, liquidity and cash flows may be adversely affected. In addition, we incur costs and make capital expenditures for new program awards based upon certain estimates of production volumes and production complexity. While we attempt to recover such costs and capital expenditures by appropriately pricing our products, the prices of our products are based in part upon planned production volumes. If the actual production is significantly less than planned or significantly more complex than anticipated, we may be unable to recover such costs. In addition, because a significant portion of our overall costs is fixed, declines in our customers’ production levels can adversely affect the level of our reported profits even if our up-front investments are recovered. We may not realize all of the intangible assets related to RSPs. Our total investments in participation fees under our RSPs as of December 31, 2012 equaled $293.7 million, all of which have been paid. At December 31, 2012, the remaining 7Table of Contentsunamortized balance of these participation fees was $239.1 million. We participate in aftermarket RSPs under which we receive an exclusive right to supply designated aftermarket parts over the life of the related aircraft engine program to a large aerospace manufacturer. As consideration, we pay participation fees, which are recorded as long-lived intangible assets and are recognized as a reduction of sales over the estimated useful life of the related engine programs which range up to 30 years. The realizability of each intangible asset is dependent upon future revenues related to the program’s aftermarket parts and is subject to impairment testing whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. The potential exists that actual revenues will not meet expectations due to a change in market conditions, including, for example, the replacement of older airplane engines with new, more fuel-efficient engines. A shortfall in future revenues may result in the failure to realize the total amount of the investments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and cash flows. In addition, future growth and profitability could be impacted by increasing management fees, amortization of the participation fees and the expiration of the Singapore Pioneer tax status incentives on these programs. We face risks of cost overruns and losses on fixed-price contracts. We sell certain of our products under firm, fixed-price contracts providing for a fixed price for the products regardless of the production or purchase costs incurred by us. The cost of producing products may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, outside processing, overhead and other factors, including manufacturing inefficiencies. Increased production costs may result in cost overruns and losses on contracts. The departure of existing management and key personnel, a shortage of skilled employees or a lack of qualified sales professionals could materially affect our business, operations and prospects. Our executive officers are important to the management and direction of our business. Our future success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain or replace these officers and other capable management personnel. Although we believe we will be able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should the need arise, our inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Because of the complex nature of many of our products and services, we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilled workforce, including, for example, our engineering talent. In addition, there are significant costs associated with the hiring and training of sales professionals. We could be adversely affected by a shortage of available skilled employees or the loss of a significant number of our sales professionals. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights effectively, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We own or are licensed under various intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks and trade secrets. Our intellectual property rights may expire or be challenged, invalidated or infringed upon by third parties. Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage, adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position, financial condition and results of operations.Any product liability, warranty, contractual or other claims in excess of insurance may adversely affect our financial condition. Our operations expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of our products and the products we buy from third parties and sell to our customers, or to potential warranty, contractual or other claims. For example, we may be exposed to potential liability for personal injury, property damage or death as a result of the failure of a spring or other part in a vehicle or an aircraft component designed, manufactured or sold by us, or the failure of an aircraft component that has been serviced by us or of the components themselves, including potentially hazardous substances in a product purchased by us and sold by us to one of our customers. While we have liability insurance for certain risks, our insurance may not cover all liabilities. Additionally, insurance coverage may not be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us. Any material liability not covered by insurance or for which third-party indemnification is not available for the full amount of the loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.From time to time, we receive product warranty claims, under which we may be required to bear costs of repair or replacement of certain of our products. Warranty claims may range from individual customer claims to full recalls of all products in the field. We vigorously defend ourselves in connection with these matters. We cannot, however, assure you that the costs, charges and liabilities associated with these matters will not be material, or that those costs, charges and liabilities will not exceed any amounts reserved for them in our consolidated financial statements. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted by strikes or work stoppages. Approximately 13% of our U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and more than 60% of our non-U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or statutory trade union agreements. In 2013, we are scheduled to negotiate national health care and pension collective bargaining agreements with unionized employees at our Bristol, CT, Corry, PA, and Saline, MI locations, which collectively cover approximately 275 employees. In addition, we have annual negotiations in Brazil and Mexico and, collectively, these negotiations also cover approximately 290 employees in 8Table of Contentsthose two countries. We also expect to have negotiations in 2013 with two of our German locations, our Singapore location, and our Sweden location, which cover approximately 315, 49, 240 and 300 employees, respectively. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are good, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements or that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor, including healthcare, pensions or other benefits. Any potential strikes or work stoppages, and the resulting adverse impact on our relationships with customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Similarly, a protracted strike or work stoppage at any of our major customers, suppliers or other vendors could materially adversely affect our business.Changes in accounting guidance and taxation requirements could affect our financial results. New accounting guidance that may become applicable to us from time to time, or changes in the interpretations of existing guidance, could have a significant effect on our reported results for the affected periods. In addition, our products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions in which we operate. Increases in indirect taxes could affect our products’ affordability and therefore reduce our sales. We are also subject to income tax in numerous jurisdictions in which we generate revenues. Changes in tax laws, tax rates or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. Among other things, our tax liabilities are affected by the mix of pretax income or loss among the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and the repatriation of foreign earnings to the U.S. We must exercise judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes, interest and penalties; accordingly, future events could change management’s assessment of these amounts. RISKS RELATED TO THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE A general economic downturn could adversely affect our business and financial results. All of our businesses are impacted by the health of the economies in which they operate. A decline in economies in which we operate could reduce demand for our products and services or increase pricing pressures, thereby having an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We derive a large portion of our sales from the transportation industry.  The operation of our business within that industry subjects us to the pressures applicable to all companies operating in it, including unfavorable pricing pressures. While the precise effects of instability in the transportation industry are difficult to determine, they may negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We operate in very competitive markets. We may not be able to compete effectively with our competitors, and competitive pressures could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our three global business segments compete with a number of larger and smaller companies in the markets we serve. Some of our competitors have greater financial, production, research and development, or other resources than we do. Within Aerospace, certain of our OEM customers compete with our repair and overhaul business. Some of our OEM customers in the aerospace industry also compete with us where they have the ability to manufacture the components and assemblies that we supply to them but have chosen, for capacity limitations, cost considerations or other reasons, to outsource the manufacturing to us. Our three business segments compete on the basis of price, service, quality, reliability of supply, technology, innovation and design. A majority of the products sold by Distribution are not unique, and its competitors carry substantially similar products. We must continue to make investments to maintain and improve our competitive position. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or that we will be successful in maintaining our competitive position. Our competitors may develop products or services, or methods of delivering those products or services that are superior to our products, services or methods. Our competitors may also adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. Pricing pressures could cause us to adjust the prices of certain of our products to stay competitive. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with our existing or future competitors. Also, if consolidation of our existing competitors occurs, we expect the competitive pressures we face to increase. Our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our customers’ businesses are generally cyclical. Weaknesses in the industries in which our customers operate could impact our revenues and profitability. The industries to which we sell tend to decline in response to overall declines in industrial production. Aerospace is heavily dependent on the commercial aerospace industry, which is cyclical and a long cycle industry. Industrial and Distribution are dependent on the transportation industry, and general industrial and tooling markets, all of which are also cyclical. Many of our customers have historically experienced periodic downturns, which often have had a negative effect on demand for our products. Original equipment manufacturers in the aerospace and transportation industries have significant pricing leverage over suppliers and may be able to achieve price reductions over time. Additionally, we may not be successful in our efforts to raise prices on our customers. There is substantial and continuing pressure from OEMs in the transportation industries, including automotive and aerospace, to reduce the prices they pay to suppliers. We attempt to manage such downward pricing pressure, while trying to preserve our business relationships with our customers, by seeking to reduce our 9Table of Contentsproduction costs through various measures, including purchasing raw materials and components at lower prices and implementing cost-effective process improvements. Our suppliers have periodically resisted, and in the future may resist, pressure to lower their prices and may seek to impose price increases. If we are unable to offset OEM price reductions, our profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, OEMs have substantial leverage in setting purchasing and payment terms, including the terms of accelerated payment programs under which payments are made prior to the account due date in return for an early payment discount. OEMs can unexpectedly change their purchasing policies or payment practices, which could have a negative impact on our short-term working capital. Demand for our defense-related products depends on government spending. A portion of Aerospace's sales are derived from the military market, including single-sourced and dual-sourced sales. The military market is largely dependent upon government budgets and is subject to governmental appropriations. Although multi-year contracts may be authorized in connection with major procurements, funds are generally appropriated on a fiscal year basis even though a program may be expected to continue for several years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded and additional funds are committed only as further appropriations are made. We cannot assure you that maintenance of or increases in defense spending will be allocated to programs that would benefit our business. Moreover, we cannot assure you that new military aircraft programs in which we participate will enter full-scale production as expected. A decrease in levels of defense spending or the government’s termination of, or failure to fully fund, one or more of the contracts for the programs in which we participate could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.The consolidation occurring in the industries in which we operate could adversely affect our business and financial results. The industries in which we operate have been experiencing consolidation. There has been consolidation of both suppliers and the customers we serve. Supplier consolidation is in part attributable to OEMs more frequently awarding long-term sole source or preferred supplier contracts to the most capable suppliers in an effort to reduce the total number of suppliers from whom components and systems are purchased. We cannot assure you that our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows will not be adversely impacted as a result of consolidation by our competitors or customers. The aerospace industry is highly regulated. Complications related to aerospace regulations may adversely affect the Company. A substantial portion of our income is derived from our aerospace businesses. The aerospace industry is highly regulated in the U.S. by the Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, and in other countries by similar regulatory agencies. We must be certified by these agencies and, in some cases, by individual OEMs in order to engineer and service systems and components used in specific aircraft models. If material authorizations or approvals were delayed, revoked or suspended, our business could be adversely affected. New or more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted, or industry oversight heightened, in the future, and we may incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or any heightened industry oversight. Environmental regulations impose costs and regulatory requirements on our operations. Environmental compliance may be more costly than we expect, and we may be subject to material environmental-based claims in the future. Our past and present business operations and past and present ownership and operations of real property and the use, sale, storage and handling of chemicals and hazardous products subject us to extensive and changing U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, as well as those of other countries, pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, enforcement, disposition of wastes (including hazardous wastes), the use, shipping, labeling, and storage of chemicals and hazardous materials, building requirements, or otherwise relating to protection of the environment. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations. In addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become subject to new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations. In addition, many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we monitor hazardous waste management and applicable environmental permitting and reporting for compliance with applicable laws at our locations in the ordinary course of our business. We may be subject to potential material liabilities relating to any investigation and clean-up of our locations or properties where we delivered hazardous waste for handling or disposal that may be contaminated or which may have been contaminated prior to our purchase, and to claims alleging personal injury. High jet fuel and other energy prices may impact our operating results. Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of operating expenses for companies in the aerospace industry. Widespread disruption to oil production, refinery operations and pipeline capacity in certain areas of the U.S. can increase the price of jet fuel significantly. Conflicts in the Middle East, an important source of oil for the U.S. and other countries where we do business, cause prices for fuel to be volatile and often significantly higher than historic levels. Because we and many of our customers are in the aerospace industry, increased fuel costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. The price of energy generally 10Table of Contentsimpacts the cost of operating our manufacturing and distribution operations. We have experienced significant increases in energy costs, and energy costs could continue to rise, which would result in higher transportation, freight and other operating costs. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to pass along energy costs to our customers through increased prices.Our products and services may be rendered obsolete by new products, technologies and processes. Our manufacturing operations focus on highly engineered components which require extensive engineering and research and development time. Our competitive advantage may be adversely impacted if we cannot continue to introduce new products ahead of our competition, or if our products are rendered obsolete by other products or by new, different technologies and processes. Additionally, we may face increased or unexpected costs associated with new product introduction including the use of additional resources such as personnel. RISKS RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING, ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES AND JOINT VENTURES Our acquisition and divestiture strategies and our restructuring activities may not be successful. We have made a number of acquisitions in the past and we anticipate that we may, from time to time, acquire additional businesses, assets or securities of companies that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our businesses. A significant portion of the industries that we serve are mature industries. As a result, our future growth may depend in part on the successful acquisition and integration of businesses into our existing operations. We may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions, obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms, obtain regulatory approvals or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future. We have also in the past divested assets and businesses. We may in the future engage in discussions with potential acquirers of certain of our assets or businesses in order to meet our strategic objectives, but we cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in finding suitable purchasers for any such desired sale of such assets or businesses. We will need to integrate any acquired businesses with our existing operations. We cannot assure you that we will effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business or product offerings or realize anticipated operational synergies. In connection with the integration of acquired operations or the conduct of our overall business strategies, we may periodically restructure our businesses and/or sell assets or portions of our business. Integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies into our existing operations may result in difficulties, significant expense and accounting charges, disrupt our business or divert management’s time and attention. Acquisitions involve numerous other risks, including potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business. In connection with acquisitions or joint venture investments outside the U.S., we may enter into derivative contracts to purchase foreign currency in order to hedge against the risk of foreign currency fluctuations in connection with such acquisitions or joint venture investments, which subjects us to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations associated with such derivative contracts. Additionally, our final determinations and appraisals of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions may vary materially from earlier estimates. We cannot assure you that the fair value of acquired businesses will remain constant.The acquisition of Synventive exposes the Company to a number of risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of any of which could materially adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations as well as the market price of our common stock. Such risks and uncertainties include risks relating to the integration of Synventive's business with the Company, the financial performance of Synventive and risks associated with incurring additional indebtedness. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of the Synventive acquisition. Our ability to realize such benefits will depend on our ability to successfully and efficiently integrate Synventive's business, which involves products and services, markets and geographies that are new to the Company, into our business, in addition to an increased scale of our international operations. Difficulties of integration could include coordinating and consolidating separate systems, integrating the management of the acquired business, retaining market acceptance of Synventive's products and services, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees, and implementing our enterprise resource planning systems and operational procedures and disciplines. Any such difficulties may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with employees, customers, business partners and suppliers. In addition, even if integration is successful, the financial performance of the acquired business may not be as expected and there can be no assurance we will realize anticipated revenue and earnings enhancements from the Synventive acquisition. In addition, our management has spent, and will continue to spend, a significant amount of its time and efforts directed toward the integration of Synventive, which time and efforts otherwise could have been spent on our other businesses and other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us. Finally, we have incurred a substantial amount of additional indebtedness which could have an adverse effect on our financial health and make it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing in the future. The additional debt we incurred to fund the acquisition purchase price may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and may limit our ability to obtain 11Table of Contentsany necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, future acquisitions, debt service requirements or other purposes. Additionally, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to meet these additional debt obligations. Any default under the Credit Agreement could result in the acceleration of the repayment obligations to our lenders, as well as the acceleration of all of our outstanding debt. The realization of any of the foregoing risks may materially adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations or the market price of our common stock. In accordance with applicable SEC guidance, management's report on internal control over financial reporting excludes the assessment of Synventive. We plan to fully evaluate the internal controls of Synventive and any subsequently acquired companies, then implement a standardized framework of internal controls at those acquired businesses. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to provide a report that contains no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses with respect to Synventive or any other acquisitions. If we engage in a divestiture of assets or a business, we cannot be certain that our business, operating results and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected. A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to any purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to retain, reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business, and collect the proceeds from any divestitures. In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other products offered by us. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of any divestiture transaction, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. In addition, divestitures of businesses involve a number of risks, including thediversion of management and employee attention, significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships, and a decrease in revenues and earnings associated with the divested business. Furthermore, divestitures potentially involve significant post-closing separation activities, which could involve the expenditure of material financial resources and significant employee resources. Any divestiture may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the dilutive impact from the loss of revenue associated with the divestiture, as well as significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.We may not achieve expected cost savings from restructuring activities and actual charges, costs and adjustments due to restructuring activities may vary materially from our estimates. Our ability to realize anticipated cost savings, synergies and revenue enhancements may be affected by a number of factors, including the following: our ability to effectively eliminate duplicative back office overhead and overlapping sales personnel, rationalize manufacturing capacity, synchronize information technology systems, consolidate warehousing and distribution facilities and shift production to more economical facilities; significant cash and non-cash integration and implementation costs or charges in order to achieve those cost savings, which could offset any such savings and other synergies resulting from our acquisitions or divestitures; and our ability to avoid labor disruption in connection with integration efforts or divestitures. Any joint ventures or teaming arrangements we enter into may not be successful. We may enter into joint ventures or teaming arrangements. Partners with whom we share control may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the joint venture or arrangement. Our joint venture or teaming arrangements may require us to pay certain costs or to make certain capital investments and we may have little control over the amount or the timing of these payments and investments. In addition, our joint venture or teaming partners may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. Our failure or the failure of an entity in which we have a joint venture interest or teaming arrangement to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions, joint ventures or teaming arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We cannot assure you that any of our joint ventures or teaming arrangements will be profitable or that forecasts regarding joint venture or teaming activities will be accurate. In particular, risks and uncertainties associated with our joint ventures and teaming arrangements include, among others, the joint venture’s or teaming partner’s ability to operate its business successfully, to develop appropriate standards, controls, procedures and policies for the growth and management of the joint venture or teaming arrangement and the strength of the their relationships with employees, suppliers and customers. "
2,B,BARNES GROUP INC,2012-02-21,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
 Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks. Please note that additional risks not presently known to us may also materially impact our business and operations. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS We depend on revenues and earnings from a small number of significant customers. Any bankruptcy of or loss, cancellation, reduction or delay in purchases by these customers could harm our business. In 2011, our net sales to General Electric and its subsidiaries accounted for 19% of our total sales. These sales from General Electric were equally distributed across both business segments, individually representing approximately 19% of sales at Logistics and Manufacturing Services and 19% of sales at Precision Components. Additionally, approximately 20% of Precision Components’ sales in 2011 were to its next five largest customers and approximately 11% of Logistics and Manufacturing Services sales in 2011 were to its next two largest customers.  Some of our success will depend on the business strength and viability of those customers. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our largest customers. A tightening in the credit markets may affect our customers’ ability to raise debt or equity capital. This may reduce the amount of liquidity available to our customers which may limit their ability to purchase products. Some of our customers may in the future reduce their purchases due to economic conditions or shift their purchases from us to our competitors, in-house or to other sources. Some of our long-term sales agreements provide that until a firm order is placed by a customer for a particular product, the customer 3Table of Contentsmay unilaterally reduce or discontinue its projected purchases without penalty, or terminate for convenience. The loss of one or more of our largest customers, any reduction, cancellation or delay in sales to these customers (including a reduction in aftermarket volume in our RSPs), our inability to successfully develop relationships with new customers, or future price concessions we make to retain customers could significantly reduce our sales and profitability.  We have significant indebtedness that could affect our operations and financial condition. At December 31, 2011, we had consolidated debt obligations of $346.1 million, representing approximately 32% of our total capital (indebtedness plus stockholders’ equity) as of that date. Our level of indebtedness, proportion of variable rate debt obligations and the significant debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness may adversely affect our operations and financial condition as well as the value or trading price of our outstanding equity securities and debt securities. For example, our indebtedness could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, investments in technology and research and development, acquisitions, dividends and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industries in which we compete; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors, some of whom have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources than we do; limit our ability to borrow additional funds; or increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. In addition, in the recent past, conditions in the worldwide credit markets have limited our ability to expand our credit lines beyond current bank commitments, and these conditions could reappear.The outlook for global economic recovery remains uncertain. There continues to be substantial uncertainty about the degree and pace of global economic recovery from the recent recession. Prolonged slow growth or a downturn, further worsening or broadening of adverse conditions in the worldwide and domestic economies could affect purchases of our products, and create or exacerbate credit issues, cash flow issues and other financial hardships for us and for our suppliers and customers. Depending upon their severity and duration, these conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Our failure to meet certain financial covenants required by our debt agreements may materially and adversely affect our assets, financial position and cash flows. Some of our debt arrangements require us to maintain certain debt and interest coverage ratios and limit our ability to incur debt, make investments or undertake certain other business activities. These requirements could limit our ability to obtain future financing and may prevent us from taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. Our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our debt arrangements may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the restrictions could result in an event of default under our debt arrangements which, in turn, could result in an event of default under the terms of our other indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our debt arrangements, after the expiration of any grace periods, our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our debt arrangements, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to happen, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the payments due under those arrangements or our other indebtedness. Our operations depend on our manufacturing, distribution, sales, service facilities and information systems in various parts of the world which are subject to physical, financial, regulatory, environmental, operational and other risks that could disrupt our operations. We have a significant number of manufacturing facilities and distribution, technical service and sales centers outside the United States. The international scope of our business subjects us to increased risks and uncertainties such as threats of war, terrorism and instability of governments, and economic, regulatory and legal systems in countries in which we or our customers conduct business. In addition, because we depend upon our information systems to help process orders, to manage inventory and accounts receivable collections, to purchase, sell and ship products efficiently and on a timely basis, to maintain cost-effective operations, and to help provide superior service to our customers, any disruption or failure in the operation of our information systems, including from conversions or integrations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Some of our facilities are located in areas that may be affected by natural disasters, including earthquakes or tsunamis, which could cause significant damage and disruption to the operations of those facilities and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, some of our manufacturing equipment and tooling is custom-made and is not readily replaceable. Loss of such equipment or tooling could have a negative impact on our manufacturing business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Although we have obtained property damage and business interruption insurance, a major catastrophe such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, tsunami or other natural disaster at any of our sites, or significant labor strikes, work stoppages, political unrest, or any of the events described above, some of which may not be covered by our insurance, in any of the areas where we conduct operations could result in a prolonged interruption of our business. Any disruption resulting from these 4Table of Contentsevents could cause significant delays in the manufacture or shipment of products or the provision of repair and other services that may result in our loss of sales and customers. Our insurance will not cover all potential risks, and we cannot assure you that we will have adequate insurance to compensate us for all losses that result from any insured risks. Any material loss not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We cannot assure you that insurance will be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us or at a cost that will not have a material adverse effect on our profitability, net income and cash flows.Further, in the ordinary course of our business, we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our  business operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations, and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business. The global nature of our business exposes us to foreign currency fluctuations that may affect our future revenues and profitability. We have manufacturing facilities and distribution, technical service and sales centers around the world, and the majority of our foreign operations use the local currency as their functional currency. These include, among others, the Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, Euro, Korean won, Mexican peso, Singapore dollar, Swedish krona, Swiss franc and Thai baht. Since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies expose us to translation risk when the local currency financial statements are translated to U.S. dollars. Changes in currency exchange rates may also expose us to transaction risk. We may buy protecting or offsetting positions or hedges in certain currencies to reduce our exposure to currency exchange fluctuations; however, these transactions may not be adequate or effective to protect us from the exposure for which they are purchased. We have not engaged in any speculative hedging activities. Currency fluctuations may impact our revenues and profitability in the future. Our operations and assets subject us to additional financial and regulatory risks. We have operations and assets in various parts of the world. In addition, we sell or may in the future sell our products and services to the U.S. and foreign government and in foreign countries. Accordingly, we are subject to various risks, including: U.S. imposed embargoes of sales to specific countries; foreign import controls (which may be arbitrarily imposed or enforced); import regulations and duties; export regulations (which require us to comply with stringent licensing regimes); anti-dumping regulations; price and currency controls; exchange rate fluctuations; dividend remittance restrictions; expropriation of assets; war, civil uprisings and riots; government instability; government contracting requirements, including various procurement, security, and audit requirements, as well as requirements to certify to the government compliance with these requirements; the necessity of obtaining governmental approval for new and continuing products and operations; legal systems or decrees, laws, taxes, regulations, interpretations and court decisions that are not always fully developed and that may be retroactively or arbitrarily applied; and difficulties in managing a global enterprise. We have experienced inadvertent violations of some of these regulations, including export regulations, regulations prohibiting sales of certain products, product labeling regulations, and regulations prohibiting air transport of aerosol products, in the past, none of which has had or, we believe, will have a material adverse effect on our business. However, any significant violations of these or other regulations in the future could result in civil or criminal sanctions, and the loss of export or other licenses which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may also be subject to unanticipated income taxes, excise duties, import taxes, export taxes, value added tax, or other governmental assessments, and taxes may be impacted by changes in legislation in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, our organizational and capital structure may limit our ability to transfer funds between countries, particularly into the United States, without incurring adverse tax consequences. Any of these events could result in a loss of business or other unexpected costs that could reduce sales or profits and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our ability to recover our significant deferred tax assets related to tax operating loss carryforwards depends on future income. We have significant deferred tax assets related to operating loss carryforwards. The realization of these assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the United States during the operating loss carryforward period. Failure to realize this tax benefit could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in the availability or price of materials, products and energy resources could adversely affect our costs and profitability. We may be adversely affected by the availability or price of raw materials, products and energy resources, particularly related to certain manufacturing operations that utilize high-grade steel spring wire, titanium and inconel. The availability and price of raw materials and energy resources may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other 5Table of Contentsthings, new laws or regulations, global economic or political events including strikes, terrorist attacks and war, suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. In some instances there are limited sources for raw materials and a limited number of primary suppliers for some of our products for resale. Although we are not dependent upon any single source for any of our principal raw materials or products for resale, and such materials and products have, historically, been readily available, we cannot assure you that such raw materials and products will continue to be readily available. Disruption in the supply of raw materials, products or energy resources or our inability to come to favorable agreements with our suppliers could impair our ability to manufacture, sell and deliver our products and require us to pay higher prices. Any increase in prices for such raw materials, products or energy resources could materially adversely affect our costs and our profitability. We maintain pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the U.S. and certain international locations. Our costs of providing defined benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on the plans’ assets, exchange rate fluctuations, future governmental regulation, global equity prices, and our required and/or voluntary contributions to the plans. Declines in the stock market, prevailing interest rates, declines in discount rates and rising medical costs may cause an increase in our pension and other postretirement benefit expenses in the future and result in reductions in our pension fund asset values and increases in our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. These changes have caused and may continue to cause a significant reduction in our net worth and without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans’ assets, and depending upon the other factors listed above, we could be required to increase funding for some or all of these pension and postretirement plans.Our cash may be highly concentrated with certain financial institutions.  At various times we may have a concentration of cash in accounts with financial institutions in the U.S. and around the globe.  Our holdings in any one or more of these institutions may significantly exceed the insured limits of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or their equivalent outside the U.S.We carry significant inventories and a loss in net realizable value could cause a decline in our net worth. At December 31, 2011, our inventories totaled $216.5 million.  Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market based on managements' judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels, quantities and prices at which such inventories will be sold in the normal course of business. Accelerating the disposal process or incorrect estimates of future sales potential may necessitate future adjustments to these provisions.  The Company's inventories include specialty spare parts for the aerospace market. The demand for these spare parts and our ability to utilize these parts depends on the frequency and scope of repair and maintenance of aircraft engines and our ability to effectively access that market.   We have significant goodwill and an impairment of our goodwill could cause a decline in our net worth. Our total assets include substantial goodwill. At December 31, 2011, our goodwill totaled $366.1 million.  The goodwill results from our prior acquisitions, representing the excess of the purchase price we paid over the net assets of the companies acquired. We assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill during each calendar year or sooner if triggering events warrant. If future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units does not meet expectations or fair values fall due to significant stock market declines, we may be required to reflect a non-cash charge to operating results for goodwill impairment. The recognition of an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material. We could be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. Our profitability may be adversely affected as a result of increases in interest rates. At December 31, 2011, we and our subsidiaries had approximately $346.1 million aggregate principal amount of consolidated debt obligations outstanding, of which approximately 84% had interest rates that float with the market. A 100 basis point increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in effect at December 31, 2011 would have resulted in an approximate $2.9 million annualized increase in interest expense. We may not realize all of the sales expected from our existing backlog or anticipated orders. At December 31, 2011, we had $581.9 million of order backlog, the majority of which related to aerospace OEM customers. There can be no assurances that the revenues projected in our backlog will be realized or, if realized, will result in profits. We consider backlog to be firm customer orders for future delivery. From time to time, OEM customers of Precision Components provide projections of components and assemblies that they anticipate purchasing in the future under new and existing programs. Such projections are not included in our backlog unless we have received a firm order from our customers. Our customers may have the right under certain circumstances and with certain penalties or consequences to terminate, reduce or defer firm orders that we have in backlog. If our customers terminate, reduce or defer firm orders, we may be protected from certain costs and losses, but our sales will nevertheless be adversely affected. Although we strive to maintain ongoing relationships with our customers, there is an ongoing risk that orders may be cancelled or rescheduled due to fluctuations in our customers’ business needs or purchasing budgets. 6Table of ContentsAlso, our realization of sales from new and existing programs is inherently subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties, including whether our customers execute the launch of product programs on time, or at all, the number of units that our customers actually produce, the timing of production and manufacturing insourcing decisions made by our customers. In addition, until firm orders are placed, our customers generally have the right to discontinue a program or replace us with another supplier at any time without penalty. Our failure to realize sales from new and existing programs could have a material adverse effect on our net sales, results of operations and cash flows.We may not recover all of our up-front costs related to new or existing programs. New programs require significant up-front investments for capital equipment, engineering, inventory, design and tooling. As OEMs in the transportation and aerospace industries have looked to suppliers to bear increasing responsibility for the design, engineering and manufacture of systems and components, they have increasingly shifted the financial risk associated with those responsibilities to the suppliers as well. This trend is likely to continue and is most evident in the area of engineering cost reimbursement. We cannot assure you that we will have adequate funds to make such up-front investments or to recover such costs from our customers as part of our product pricing. In the event that we are unable to make such investments, or to recover them through sales or direct reimbursement from our customers, our profitability, liquidity and cash flows may be adversely affected. In addition, we incur costs and make capital expenditures for new program awards based upon certain estimates of production volumes and production complexity. While we attempt to recover such costs and capital expenditures by appropriately pricing our products, the prices of our products are based in part upon planned production volumes. If the actual production is significantly less than planned or significantly more complex than anticipated, we may be unable to recover such costs. In addition, because a significant portion of our overall costs is fixed, declines in our customers’ production levels can adversely affect the level of our reported profits even if our up-front investments are recovered. We may not realize all of the intangible asset related to RSPs. Our total investments in participation fees under our RSPs as of December 31, 2011 equaled $293.7 million, all of which have been paid. At December 31, 2011, the remaining unamortized balance of these participation fees was $247.3 million. We participate in aftermarket RSPs under which we receive an exclusive right to supply designated aftermarket parts over the life of the related aircraft engine program to a large aerospace manufacturer. As consideration, we pay participation fees, which are recorded as long-lived intangible assets and are recognized as a reduction of sales over the estimated useful life of the related engine programs which range up to 30 years. The realizability of each intangible asset is dependent upon future revenues related to the program’s aftermarket parts and is subject to impairment testing whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. The potential exists that actual revenues will not meet expectations due to a change in market conditions, including, for example, the replacement of older airplane engines with new, more fuel-efficient engines. A shortfall in future revenues may result in the failure to realize the total amount of the investments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and cash flows. In addition, future growth and profitability could be impacted by increasing management fees, amortization of the participation fees and the expiration of the Singapore Pioneer tax incentives on these programs. We face risks of cost overruns and losses on fixed-price contracts. We sell certain of our products under firm, fixed-price contracts providing for a fixed price for the products regardless of the production or purchase costs incurred by us. The cost of producing products may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, outside processing, overhead and other factors, including manufacturing inefficiencies. Increased production costs may result in cost overruns and losses on contracts. The departure of existing management and key personnel, a shortage of skilled employees or a lack of qualified sales professionals could materially affect our business, operations and prospects. Our executive officers are important to the management and direction of our business. Our future success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain or replace these officers and other capable management personnel. Although we believe we will be able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should the need arise, our inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Because of the complex nature of many of our products and services, we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilled workforce. In addition, there are significant costs associated with the hiring and training of sales professionals. We could be adversely affected by a shortage of available skilled employees or the loss of a significant number of our sales professionals. Any product liability, warranty, contractual or other claims in excess of insurance may adversely affect our financial condition. Our operations expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of our products and the products we buy from third parties and sell to our customers, or to potential warranty, contractual or other claims. For example, we may be exposed to potential liability for personal injury, property damage or death as a result of the failure of a spring or other part in a vehicle or an aircraft component designed, manufactured or sold by us, or the failure of an aircraft component that has been serviced by us or of the components themselves, including potentially 7Table of Contentshazardous substances in a product purchased by us and sold by us to one of our customers. While we have liability insurance for certain risks, our insurance may not cover all liabilities. Additionally, insurance coverage may not be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us. Any material liability not covered by insurance or for which third-party indemnification is not available for the full amount of the loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted by strikes or work stoppages. Approximately 13% of our U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and 42% of our non-U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or statutory trade union agreements. In 2012, we will be negotiating collective bargaining agreements with unionized employees at our Corry, PA, Milwaukee, WI, and Germany locations, which collectively cover approximately 300 employees.  In addition, we have annual negotiations in Mexico and Brazil and, collectively, these negotiations also cover approximately 300 employees in those two countries. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are good, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements or that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor, including healthcare, pensions or other benefits. Any potential strikes or work stoppages, and the resulting adverse impact on our relationships with customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Similarly, a protracted strike or work stoppage at any of our major customers, suppliers or other vendors could materially adversely affect our business. Changes in accounting guidance and taxation requirements could affect our financial results. New accounting guidance that may become applicable to us from time to time, or changes in the interpretations of existing guidance, could have a significant effect on our reported results for the affected periods. In addition, our products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions in which we operate. Increases in indirect taxes could affect our products’ affordability and therefore reduce our sales. We are also subject to income tax in numerous jurisdictions in which we generate revenues. Changes in tax laws, tax rates or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. Among other things, our tax liabilities are affected by the mix of pretax income or loss among the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and repatriation of foreign earnings to the United States. We must exercise judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes, interest and penalties; accordingly, future events could change management’s assessment of these amounts. RISKS RELATED TO THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE A general economic downturn could adversely affect our business and financial results. All of our businesses are impacted by the health of the economies in which they operate. A decline in economies in which we operate could reduce demand for our products and services or increase pricing pressures, thereby having an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We derive a large portion of our sales from the transportation industry.  The operation of our business within that industry subjects us to the pressures applicable to all companies operating in it, including unfavorable pricing pressures. While the precise effects of instability in the transportation industry are difficult to determine, they may negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We operate in very competitive markets. We may not be able to compete effectively with our competitors, and competitive pressures could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our two global business segments compete with a number of larger and smaller companies in the markets we serve. Some of our competitors have greater financial, production, research and development, or other resources than we do. Within the aerospace aftermarket business unit, certain of our OEM customers compete with our repair and overhaul business. Some of our OEM customers in the aerospace industry also compete with us where they have the ability to manufacture the components and assemblies that we supply to them but have chosen, for capacity limitations, cost considerations or other reasons, to outsource the manufacturing to us. Our two business segments compete on the basis of price, service, quality, reliability of supply, technology, innovation and design. The products sold by Logistics and Manufacturing Services are not unique, and its competitors carry substantially similar products. We must continue to make investments to maintain and improve our competitive position. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or that we will be successful in maintaining our competitive position. Our competitors may develop products or services, or methods of delivering those products or services that are superior to our products, services or methods. Our competitors may also adapt more quickly than we to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. Pricing pressures could cause us to adjust the prices of certain of our products to stay competitive. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with our existing or future competitors. Also, if consolidation of our existing competitors occurs, we expect the competitive pressures we face to increase. Our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our customers’ businesses are generally cyclical. Weaknesses in the industries in which our customers operate could impact our revenues and profitability. The industries to which we sell tend to decline in response to overall declines in 8Table of Contentsindustrial production. The OEM aerospace unit of Precision Components and the aftermarket aerospace unit of Logistics and Manufacturing Services are heavily dependent on the commercial aerospace industry, which is cyclical and a long cycle industry. In addition, parts of both Precision Components and Logistics and Manufacturing Services are dependent on the transportation industry, and general industrial and tooling markets, all of which are also cyclical. Many of our customers have historically experienced periodic downturns, which often have had a negative effect on demand for our products. Original equipment manufacturers in the aerospace and transportation industries have significant pricing leverage over suppliers and may be able to achieve price reductions over time. Additionally, we may not be successful in our efforts to raise prices on our customers. There is substantial and continuing pressure from OEMs in the transportation industries, including automotive and aerospace, to reduce the prices they pay to suppliers. We attempt to manage such downward pricing pressure, while trying to preserve our business relationships with our customers, by seeking to reduce our production costs through various measures, including purchasing raw materials and components at lower prices and implementing cost-effective process improvements. Our suppliers have periodically resisted, and in the future may resist, pressure to lower their prices and may seek to impose price increases. If we are unable to offset OEM price reductions, our profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, OEMs have substantial leverage in setting purchasing and payment terms, including the terms of accelerated payment programs under which payments are made prior to the account due date in return for an early payment discount. OEMs can unexpectedly change their purchasing policies or payment practices, which could have a negative impact on our short-term working capital. Demand for our defense-related products depends on government spending. A portion of the Precision Components aerospace units’ sales are derived from the military market, including single-sourced and dual-sourced sales. The military market is largely dependent upon government budgets and is subject to governmental appropriations. Although multi-year contracts may be authorized in connection with major procurements, funds are generally appropriated on a fiscal year basis even though a program may be expected to continue for several years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded and additional funds are committed only as further appropriations are made. We cannot assure you that maintenance of or increases in defense spending will be allocated to programs that would benefit our business. Moreover, we cannot assure you that new military aircraft programs in which we participate will enter full-scale production as expected. A decrease in levels of defense spending or the government’s termination of, or failure to fully fund, one or more of the contracts for the programs in which we participate could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. The consolidation occurring in the industries in which we operate could adversely affect our business and financial results. The industries in which we operate have been experiencing consolidation. There has been consolidation of both suppliers and the customers we serve. Supplier consolidation is in part attributable to OEMs more frequently awarding long-term sole source or preferred supplier contracts to the most capable suppliers in an effort to reduce the total number of suppliers from whom components and systems are purchased. We cannot assure you that our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows will not be adversely impacted as a result of consolidation by our competitors or customers. The aerospace industry is highly regulated. Complications related to aerospace regulations may adversely affect the Company. A substantial portion of our income is derived from our aerospace businesses. The aerospace industry is highly regulated in the United States by the Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, and in other countries by similar regulatory agencies. We must be certified by these agencies and, in some cases, by individual OEMs in order to engineer and service systems and components used in specific aircraft models. If material authorizations or approvals were delayed, revoked or suspended, our business could be adversely affected. New or more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted, or industry oversight heightened, in the future, and we may incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or any heightened industry oversight. Environmental regulations impose costs and regulatory requirements on our operations. Environmental compliance may be more costly than we expect, and we may be subject to material environmental-based claims in the future. Our past and present business operations and past and present ownership and operations of real property and the use, sale, storage and handling of chemicals and hazardous products subject us to extensive and changing U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, as well as those of other countries, pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, enforcement, disposition of wastes (including hazardous wastes), the use, shipping, labeling, and storage of chemicals and hazardous materials, building requirements, or otherwise relating to protection of the environment. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations. In addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become subject to new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations. In addition, many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we monitor hazardous waste management and applicable 9Table of Contentsenvironmental permitting and reporting for compliance with applicable laws at our locations in the ordinary course of our business. We may be subject to potential material liabilities relating to any investigation and clean-up of our locations or properties where we delivered hazardous waste for handling or disposal that may be contaminated or which may have been contaminated prior to our purchase, and to claims alleging personal injury. High jet fuel and other energy prices may impact our operating results. Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of operating expenses for companies in the aerospace industry. Widespread disruption to oil production, refinery operations and pipeline capacity in certain areas of the United States can increase the price of jet fuel significantly. Conflicts in the Middle East, an important source of oil for the U.S. and other countries where we do business, cause prices for fuel to be volatile and often significantly higher than historic levels. Because many of our customers and we are in the aerospace industry, increased fuel costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. The price of energy generally impacts the cost of operating our manufacturing and distribution operations. We have experienced significant increases in energy costs, and energy costs could continue to rise, which would result in higher transportation, freight and other operating costs. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to pass along energy costs to our customers through increased prices.Products and services of the mature industries in which we operate may be rendered obsolete by new products, technologies and processes. Our manufacturing operations focus on highly engineered components which require extensive engineering and research and development time. Our competitive advantage may be adversely impacted if we cannot continue to introduce new products ahead of our competition, or if our products are rendered obsolete by other products or by new, different technologies and processes. Additionally, we may face increased or unexpected costs associated with new product introduction including the use of additional resources such as personnel. RISKS RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING, ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES AND JOINT VENTURES Our acquisition and divestiture strategies and our restructuring activities may not be successful. We have made a number of acquisitions in the past and we anticipate that we may, from time to time, acquire additional businesses, assets or securities of companies that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our businesses. A significant portion of the industries that we serve are mature industries. As a result, our future growth may depend in part on the successful acquisition and integration of businesses into our existing operations. We may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions, obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms, obtain regulatory approvals or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future. We have also in the past divested assets and businesses. We may in the future engage in discussions with potential acquirers of certain of our assets or businesses in order to meet our strategic objectives, but we cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in finding suitable purchasers for any such desired sale of such assets or businesses. We will need to integrate any acquired businesses with our existing operations. We cannot assure you that we will effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business or product offerings or realize anticipated operational synergies. In connection with the integration of acquired operations or the conduct of our overall business strategies, we may periodically restructure our businesses and/or sell assets or portions of our business. Integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies into our existing operations may result in difficulties, significant expense and accounting charges, disrupt our business or divert management’s time and attention. Acquisitions involve numerous other risks, including potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business. In connection with acquisitions or joint venture investments outside the U.S., we may enter into derivative contracts to purchase foreign currency in order to hedge against the risk of foreign currency fluctuations in connection with such acquisitions or joint venture investments, which subjects us to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations associated with such derivative contracts. Additionally, our final determinations and appraisals of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions may vary materially from earlier estimates. We cannot assure you that the fair value of acquired businesses will remain constant. If we engage in a divestiture of assets or a business, we cannot be certain that our business, operating results and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected. A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to any purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to retain, reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business, and collect the proceeds from any divestitures. In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other products offered by us. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of any divestiture transaction, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. In addition, divestitures of businesses involve a number of risks, including thediversion of management and employee attention, significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships, and a 10Table of Contentsdecrease in revenues and earnings associated with the divested business. Furthermore, divestitures potentially involve significant post-closing separation activities, which could involve the expenditure of material financial resources and significant employee resources. We may not achieve expected cost savings from restructuring activities and actual charges, costs and adjustments due to restructuring activities may vary materially from our estimates. Our ability to realize anticipated cost savings, synergies and revenue enhancements may be affected by a number of factors, including the following: our ability to effectively eliminate duplicative back office overhead and overlapping sales personnel, rationalize manufacturing capacity, synchronize information technology systems, consolidate warehousing and distribution facilities and shift production to more economical facilities; significant cash and non-cash integration and implementation costs or charges in order to achieve those cost savings, which could offset any such savings and other synergies resulting from our acquisitions or divestitures; and our ability to avoid labor disruption in connection with integration efforts or divestitures. Any joint ventures or teaming arrangements we enter into may not be successful. We may enter into joint ventures or teaming arrangements. Partners with whom we share control may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the joint venture or arrangement. Our joint venture or teaming arrangements may require us to pay certain costs or to make certain capital investments and we may have little control over the amount or the timing of these payments and investments. In addition, our joint venture or teaming partners may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. Our failure or the failure of an entity in which we have a joint venture interest or teaming arrangement to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions, joint ventures or teaming arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We cannot assure you that any of our joint ventures or teaming arrangements will be profitable or that forecasts regarding joint venture or teaming activities will be accurate. In particular, risks and uncertainties associated with our joint ventures and teaming arrangements include, among others, the joint venture’s or teaming partner’s ability to operate its business successfully, to develop appropriate standards, controls, procedures and policies for the growth and management of the joint venture or teaming arrangement and the strength of the their relationships with employees, suppliers and customers. "
13,B,BARNES GROUP INC,2011-02-18,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
   Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks. Pleasenote that additional risks not presently known to us may also materially impact our business and operations.    RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS    We depend on revenues and earnings from a small number of significant customers. Any bankruptcy of or loss, cancellation, reduction or delay in purchases by these customers could harm our business.In 2010, our net sales to General Electric and its subsidiaries accounted for 18% of our total sales and approximately 15% and 21% of sales at Logistics and Manufacturing Services and Precision Components, respectively. Additionally,approximately 23% of Precision Components sales in 2010 were to its next five largest customers. Some of our success will depend on the business strength and viability of those customers. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain ourlargest customers. A tightening in the credit markets may affect our customers ability to raise debt or equity capital. This may reduce the amount of liquidity available to our customers which may limit their ability to purchase products. Someof our customers may in the future reduce their purchases due to economic conditions or shift their purchases from us to our competitors, in-house or to other sources. Some of our long-term sales agreements provide that until a firm order is placedby a customer for a particular product, the customer may unilaterally reduce or discontinue its projected purchases without penalty, or terminate for convenience. The loss of one or more of our largest customers, any reduction, cancellation or delayin sales to these customers (including a reduction in aftermarket volume in our RSPs), our inability to successfully develop relationships with new customers, or future price concessions we make to retain customers could significantly reduce oursales and profitability. In addition, we may not have opportunities to enter into additional aftermarket RSPs.   We have significant indebtedness that could affect our operations and financial condition. At December 31, 2010, we hadconsolidated debt and capitalized lease obligations of $357.7 million, representing approximately 33% of our total capital (indebtedness plus stockholders equity) as of that date. Our level of indebtedness and the significant debt servicingcosts associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operations and financial condition and may adversely affect the value or trading price of our outstanding equity securities and debt securities. For example, ourindebtedness could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, investments in technologyand research and development, acquisitions, dividends and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industries in which we compete; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to ourcompetitors, some of whom have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources than we do; limit our ability to borrow additional funds; or increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. In addition,in the recent past, conditions in the worldwide credit markets have limited our ability to expand our credit lines beyond current bank commitments, and these conditions could continue or worsen.   4 Table of ContentsThe outlook for economic recovery remains uncertain. There continues to besubstantial uncertainty about the degree and pace of economic recovery from the recent recession. Prolonged slow growth or a downturn, further worsening or broadening of adverse conditions in the worldwide and domestic economies could affectpurchases of our products, and create or exacerbate credit issues, cash flow issues and other financial hardships for us and for our suppliers and customers. Depending upon their severity and duration, these conditions could have a material adverseimpact on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.    Our failure to meet certain financial covenants required by our debt agreements may materially and adversely affect our assets, financial position and cash flows. Some of our debt arrangementsrequire us to maintain certain debt and interest coverage ratios and limit our ability to incur debt, make investments or undertake certain other business activities. These requirements could limit our ability to obtain future financing and mayprevent us from taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. Our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our debt arrangements may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will satisfysuch covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the restrictions could result in an event of default under our debt arrangements which, in turn, could result in an event of default under the terms of ourother indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our debt arrangements, after the expiration of any grace periods, our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our debt arrangements, together with accruedinterest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to happen, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the payments due under those arrangements or our other indebtedness.   Our operations depend on our manufacturing, distribution,sales, service facilities and information systems in various parts of the world which are subject to physical, financial, regulatory, environmental, operational and other risks that could disrupt our operations. During 2010, approximately 42% ofour sales were from facilities outside of the United States. Also, we have a number of manufacturing facilities and distribution/sales centers outside the United States. The international scope of our business subjects us to risks such as threats ofwar, terrorism and instability of governments, and economic, regulatory and legal systems in countries in which we or our customers conduct business. In addition, because we depend upon our information systems to help process orders, to manageinventory and accounts receivable collections, to purchase, sell and ship products efficiently and on a timely basis, to maintain cost-effective operations, and to help provide superior service to our customers, any disruption or failure in theoperation of our information systems, including from conversions or integrations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Some of our facilities are located in areas that maybe affected by natural disasters, including earthquakes or tsunamis, which could cause significant damage and disruption to the operations of those facilities and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, some of our manufacturing equipment and tooling is custom-made and is not readily replaceable. Loss of such equipment or tooling could have a negative impact on our manufacturing business,financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    Although we have obtained property damage and business interruption insurance, a major catastrophe such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, tsunami or other natural disaster at any of our sites, orsignificant labor strikes, work stoppages, political unrest, or any of the events described above, some of which may not be covered by our insurance, in any of the areas where we conduct operations could result in a prolonged interruption of ourbusiness. Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in the manufacture or shipment of products or the provision of repair and other services that may result in our loss of sales and customers. Our insurance will notcover all potential risks, and we cannot assure you that we will have adequate insurance to compensate us for all losses that result from any insured risks. Any material loss not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on ourfinancial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We cannot assure you that insurance will be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us or at a cost that will not have a material adverse effect on our profitability, net income andcash flows.   5 Table of ContentsThe global nature of our business exposes us to foreign currency fluctuations that mayaffect our future revenues and profitability. We have manufacturing, sales and distribution facilities around the world, and the majority of our foreign operations use the local currency as their functional currency. These include, among others,the Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, Euro, Korean won, Mexican peso, Singapore dollar, Swedish krona, Swiss franc and Thai baht. Since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes incurrency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies expose us to translation risk when the local currency financial statements are translated to U.S. dollars. Changes in currency exchange rates may also expose us to transactionrisk. We may buy protecting or offsetting positions or hedges in certain currencies to reduce our exposure to currency exchange fluctuations; however, these transactions may not be adequate or effective to protect us from the exposure for which theyare purchased. We have not engaged in any speculative hedging activities. Currency fluctuations may impact our revenues and profitability in the future.   Our operations and assets subject us to additional financial and regulatory risks. We have operations and assets in various partsof the world. In addition, we sell or may in the future sell our products and services to the U.S. and foreign government and in foreign countries. Accordingly, we are subject to various risks, including: U.S.-imposed embargoes of sales to specificcountries; foreign import controls (which may be arbitrarily imposed or enforced); import regulations and duties; export regulations (which require us to comply with stringent licensing regimes); anti-dumping regulations; price and currencycontrols; exchange rate fluctuations; dividend remittance restrictions; expropriation of assets; war, civil uprisings and riots; government instability; requirements to provide certifications to the government with respect to compliance withgovernment requirements; the necessity of obtaining governmental approval for new and continuing products and operations; legal systems or decrees, laws, taxes, regulations, interpretations and court decisions that are not always fully developed andthat may be retroactively or arbitrarily applied; and difficulties in managing a global enterprise. We have experienced inadvertent violations of some of these regulations, including export regulations, regulations prohibiting sales of certainproducts, product labeling regulations, and regulations prohibiting air transport of aerosol products, in the past, none of which has had or, we believe, will have a material adverse effect on our business. However, any significant violations ofthese or other regulations in the future could result in civil or criminal sanctions, and the loss of export or other licenses which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may also be subject to unanticipated income taxes, exciseduties, import taxes, export taxes, value added tax, or other governmental assessments, and taxes may be impacted by changes in legislation in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, our organizational structure may limit our abilityto transfer funds between countries, particularly into and out of the United States, without incurring adverse tax consequences. Any of these events could result in a loss of business or other unexpected costs that could reduce sales or profits andhave a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    Our ability to recover our significant deferred tax assets related to tax operating loss carryforwards depends on future income. We have significant deferred tax assets related to operating losscarryforwards. The realization of these assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income during the operating loss carryforward period. Failure to realize this tax benefit could have a material adverse effect on our financialcondition and results of operations.    Changesin the availability or price of materials, products and energy resources could adversely affect our costs and profitability. We may be adversely affected by the availability or price of raw materials, products and energy resources, particularlyrelated to certain manufacturing operations that utilize high-grade steel spring wire, titanium and inconel. The availability and price of raw materials and energy resources may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, newlaws or regulations, global economic or political events including strikes, terrorist attacks and war, suppliers allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels.In some instances there are limited sources for raw materials and a limited number of primary suppliers for some of our products for resale. Although we are not dependent upon any single source for any of our principal raw materials or products forresale, and such materials and products have, historically, been readily available, we cannot assure you that such raw materials   6 Table of Contentsand products will continue to be readily available. Disruption in the supply of raw materials, products or energy resources or our inability to come to favorable agreements with our supplierscould impair our ability to manufacture, sell and deliver our products and require us to pay higher prices. Any increase in prices for such raw materials, products or energy resources could materially adversely affect our costs and ourprofitability.    We maintain pension and otherpostretirement benefit plans in the U.S. and certain international locations. Our costs of providing defined benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on the plans assets, exchange rate fluctuations,future governmental regulation, global equity prices, and our required and/or voluntary contributions to the plans. Declines in the stock market, prevailing interest rates and rising medical costs may cause an increase in our pension and otherpostretirement benefit expenses in the future and result in reductions in our pension fund asset values and increases in our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. These changes have caused and may continue to cause a significantreduction in our net worth and without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans assets, and depending upon the other factors listed above, we could be required to increase funding for some or allof these pension and postretirement plans.    Wehave significant goodwill and an impairment of our goodwill could cause a decline in our net worth. Our total assets include substantial goodwill. At December 31, 2010, our goodwill totaled $384.2 million. The goodwill results from ouracquisitions, representing the excess of the purchase price we paid over the net assets of the companies acquired. We assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill during each calendar year or sooner if triggering eventswarrant. If future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units does not meet expectations or fair values fall due to significant stock market declines, we may be required to reflect a non-cash charge to operating results for goodwillimpairment. The recognition of an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material.   We could be adversely affected by changes in interestrates. Our profitability may be adversely affected as a result of increases in interest rates. At December 31, 2010, we and our subsidiaries had approximately $357.7 million aggregate principal amount of consolidated debt and capitalizedlease obligations outstanding, of which approximately 58% had interest rates that float with the market. A 100 basis point increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in effect at December 31, 2010 would have resulted in anapproximate $2.0 million annualized increase in interest expense.    We may not realize all of the sales expected from our existing backlog or anticipated orders. At December 31, 2010, we had $482.1 million of order backlog of which $346.7 million related tothe aerospace OEM business of Precision Components. There can be no assurances that the revenues projected in our backlog will be realized or, if realized, will result in profits. We consider backlog to be firm customer orders for future delivery.From time to time, OEM customers of Precision Components provide projections of components and assemblies that they anticipate purchasing in the future under new and existing programs. Such projections are not included in our backlog unless we havereceived a firm release from our customers. Our customers may have the right under certain circumstances and with certain penalties or consequences to terminate, reduce or defer firm orders that we have in backlog. If our customers terminate, reduceor defer firm orders, we may be protected from certain costs and losses, but our sales will nevertheless be adversely affected. Although we strive to maintain ongoing relationships with our customers, there is an ongoing risk that orders may becancelled or rescheduled due to fluctuations in our customers business needs or purchasing budgets.   Also, our realization of sales from new and existing programs is inherently subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties,including whether our customers will execute the launch of product programs on time, or at all, the number of units that our customers will actually produce and the timing of production. In addition, until firm orders are placed, our customersgenerally have the right to discontinue a program or replace us with another supplier at any time without penalty. Our failure to realize sales from new and existing programs could have a material adverse effect on our net sales, results ofoperations and cash flows.   7 Table of ContentsWe may not recover all of our up-front costs related to new or existing programs. Newprograms require significant up-front investments for capital equipment, engineering, inventory, design and tooling. As OEMs in the transportation and aerospace industries have looked to suppliers to bear increasing responsibility for the design,engineering and manufacture of systems and components, they have increasingly shifted the financial risk associated with those responsibilities to the suppliers as well. This trend is likely to continue and is most evident in the area of engineeringcost reimbursement. Historically, these investments have been fully reimbursed by OEMs, but in the future there may be other mechanisms established by OEMs that could result in less than full reimbursement or no reimbursement. We cannot assure youthat we will have adequate funds to make such up-front investments. In the event that we are unable to make such investments, or to recover them through sales or direct reimbursement from our customers, our profitability, liquidity and cash flowsmay be adversely affected. In addition, we incur costs and make capital expenditures for new program awards based upon certain estimates of production volumes. While we attempt to recover such costs and capital expenditures by appropriately pricingour products, the prices of our products are based in part upon planned production volumes. If the actual production is significantly less than planned, we may be unable to recover such costs. In addition, because a significant portion of ouroverall costs is fixed, declines in our customers production levels can adversely affect the level of our reported profits even if our up-front investments are recovered.   We may not recover all of our up-front costs related toRSPs. Our total investments in RSP participation fees as of December 31, 2010 equaled $293.7 million, all of which have been paid. At December 31, 2010, the remaining unamortized balance of RSP participation fees was $257.4 million. Weparticipate in aftermarket RSPs under which we receive an exclusive right to supply designated aftermarket parts over the life of the related aircraft engine program to a large aerospace manufacturer. As consideration, we pay participation fees,which are recorded as long-lived intangible assets and are recognized as a reduction of sales over the estimated useful life of the related engine programs which range up to 30 years. The recoverability of each intangible asset is dependant uponfuture revenues related to the programs aftermarket parts and is subject to impairment testing whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. The potential exists that actual revenues will not meetexpectations due to a change in market conditions. A shortfall in future revenues may result in the failure to recover the total amount of the investments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and cashflows. In addition, future growth and profitability could be impacted by increasing management fees, amortization of the participation fees and the expiration of the Singapore Pioneer tax incentives on these programs.   We face risks of cost overruns and losses on fixed-pricecontracts. We sell certain of our products under firm, fixed-price contracts providing for a fixed price for the products regardless of the production or purchase costs incurred by us. The cost of producing products may be adversely affected byincreases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, outside processing, overhead and other factors, including manufacturing inefficiencies. Increased production costs may result in cost overruns and losses on contracts.   The departure of existing management and key personnel, ashortage of skilled employees or a lack of qualified sales professionals could materially affect our business, operations and prospects. Our executive officers are important to the management and direction of our business. Our future successdepends, in large part, on our ability to retain or replace these officers and other capable management personnel. Although we believe we will be able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should the need arise, ourinability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Because of the complex nature of many of our products and services, we are generally dependent on an educated andhighly skilled workforce. In addition, there are significant costs associated with the hiring and training of sales professionals. We could be adversely affected by a shortage of available skilled employees or the loss of a significant number of oursales professionals.    Any product liability,warranty, contractual or other claims in excess of insurance may adversely affect our financial condition. Our operations expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of our products andthe products we buy from third parties and sell to our customers, or to potential warranty, contractual or other claims. For example, we may be exposed to potential   8 Table of Contentsliability for personal injury, property damage or death as a result of the failure of a spring or other part in a vehicle or an aircraft component designed, manufactured or sold by us, or thefailure of an aircraft component that has been serviced by us or of the components themselves, including potentially hazardous substances in a product purchased by us and sold by us to one of our customers. While we have liability insurance forcertain risks, our insurance may not cover all liabilities. Additionally, insurance coverage may not be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us. Any material liability not covered by insurance or for which third-party indemnification isnot available for the full amount of the loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.   Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted by strikes or work stoppages.Approximately 13% of our U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and 45% of our non-U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or statutory trade union agreements. In 2011 we will be negotiatingcollective bargaining agreements with unionized employees at our Saline, Edison, and Elizabethtown locations. In addition, we have annual negotiations in Mexico and Brazil. Collectively, these negotiations cover approximately 300employees. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are good, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements or that such negotiations will not result in significantincreases in the cost of labor, including healthcare, pensions or other benefits. Any potential strikes or work stoppages, and the resulting adverse impact on our relationships with customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business,financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Similarly, a protracted strike or work stoppage at any of our major customers, suppliers or other vendors could materially adversely affect our business.   Changes in accounting guidance and taxation requirementscould affect our financial results. New accounting guidance that may become applicable to us from time to time, or changes in the interpretations of existing guidance, could have a significant effect on our reported results for the affectedperiods. In addition, our products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions in which we operate. Increases in indirect taxes could affect our products affordability and therefore reduceour sales. We are also subject to income tax in numerous jurisdictions in which we generate revenues. Changes in tax laws, tax rates or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. Among other things, our taxliabilities are affected by the mix of pretax income or loss among the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and repatriation of foreign earnings. We must exercise judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes, interest andpenalties; accordingly, future events could change managements assessment of these amounts.    RISKS RELATED TO THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE   A general economic downturn could adversely affect our business and financial results. All of our businesses are impacted by thehealth of the economies in which they operate. A decline in economies in which we operate could reduce demand for our products and services or increase pricing pressures, thereby having an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, resultsof operations and cash flows. We derive a large portion of our sales from the transportation industry. This industry has suffered from financial pressures which have had negative consequences for companies in, and companies with customers in, thetransportation industry. The transportation industry has generally suffered from unfavorable pricing pressures in North America and other regions. The operation of our business within that industry subjects us to the pressures applicable to allcompanies operating in it. While the precise effects of such instability on the transportation industry are difficult to determine, they may negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.   We operate in very competitive markets. We may not be ableto compete effectively with our competitors, and competitive pressures could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our two global business segments compete with a number of larger and smaller companies inthe markets we serve. Some of our competitors have greater financial, production, research and development, or other resources than we do. Within the aerospace aftermarket business unit, certain of our OEM customers compete with our repair andoverhaul business. Some of our OEM customers in the aerospace industry also   9 Table of Contentscompete with us where they have the ability to manufacture the components and assemblies that we supply to them but have chosen, for capacity limitations, cost considerations or other reasons, tooutsource the manufacturing to us. Our two business segments compete on the basis of price, service, quality, reliability of supply, technology, innovation and design. The products sold by Logistics and Manufacturing Services are not unique, and itscompetitors carry substantially similar products. We must continue to make investments to maintain and improve our competitive position. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or that we willbe successful in maintaining our competitive position. Our competitors may develop products or services, or methods of delivering those products or services that are superior to our products, services or methods. Our competitors may also adapt morequickly than we to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. Pricing pressures could cause us to adjust the prices of certain of our products to stay competitive. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with ourexisting or future competitors. Also, if consolidation of our existing competitors occurs, we expect the competitive pressures we face to increase. Our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our business, financial condition, resultsof operations and cash flows.    Ourcustomers businesses are generally cyclical. Weaknesses in the industries in which our customers operate could impact our revenues and profitability. The industries to which we sell tend to decline in response to overall declines inindustrial production. The OEM aerospace unit of Precision Components and the aftermarket aerospace unit of Logistics and Manufacturing Services are heavily dependent on the commercial aerospace industry, which is cyclical. In addition, parts ofboth Precision Components, and Logistics and Manufacturing Services are dependent on the transportation industry, and general industrial and tooling markets, all of which are also cyclical. Many of our customers have historically experiencedperiodic downturns, which often have had a negative effect on demand for our products.    Original equipment manufacturers in the transportation and aerospace industries have significant pricing leverage over suppliers and may be able to achieve price reductions over time. Additionally, wemay not be successful in our efforts to raise prices on our customers. There is substantial and continuing pressure from OEMs in the transportation industries, including automotive and aerospace, to reduce the prices they pay to suppliers. Weattempt to manage such downward pricing pressure, while trying to preserve our business relationships with our customers, by seeking to reduce our production costs through various measures, including purchasing raw materials and components at lowerprices and implementing cost-effective process improvements. Our suppliers have periodically resisted, and in the future may resist, pressure to lower their prices and may seek to impose price increases. If we are unable to offset OEM pricereductions, our profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, OEMs have substantial leverage in setting purchasing and payment terms, including the terms of accelerated payment programs under which payments are made prior tothe account due date in return for an early payment discount. OEMs can unexpectedly change their purchasing policies or payment practices, which could have a negative impact on our short-term working capital.   Demand for our defense-related products depends ongovernment spending. A portion of the Precision Components aerospace units sales are derived from the military market. The military market is largely dependent upon government budgets and is subject to governmental appropriations. Althoughmulti-year contracts may be authorized in connection with major procurements, funds are generally appropriated on a fiscal year basis even though a program may be expected to continue for several years. Consequently, programs are often onlypartially funded and additional funds are committed only as further appropriations are made. We cannot assure you that an increase in defense spending will be allocated to programs that would benefit our business. Moreover, we cannot assure you thatnew military aircraft programs in which we participate will enter full-scale production as expected. A decrease in levels of defense spending or the governments termination of, or failure to fully fund, one or more of the contracts for theprograms in which we participate could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.   10 Table of ContentsThe consolidation occurring in the industries in which we operate could adversely affectour business and financial results. The industries in which we operate have been experiencing consolidation. There has been consolidation of both suppliers and the customers we serve. Supplier consolidation is in part attributable to OEMs morefrequently awarding long-term sole source or preferred supplier contracts to the most capable suppliers in an effort to reduce the total number of suppliers from whom components and systems are purchased. We cannot assure you that our business,financial condition, results of operations or cash flows will not be adversely impacted as a result of consolidation by our competitors or customers.   The aerospace industry is highly regulated. Complications related to aerospace regulations may adversely affect the Company. Asubstantial portion of our income is derived from our aerospace businesses. The aerospace industry is highly regulated in the United States by the Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, and in other countries by similar regulatory agencies. Wemust be certified by these agencies and, in some cases, by individual OEMs in order to engineer and service systems and components used in specific aircraft models. If material authorizations or approvals were delayed, revoked or suspended, ourbusiness could be adversely affected. New or more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted, or industry oversight heightened, in the future, and we may incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or any heightened industryoversight.    Environmental regulations imposecosts and regulatory requirements on our operations. Environmental compliance may be more costly than we expect, and we may be subject to material environmental-based claims in the future. Our past and present business operations and past andpresent ownership and operations of real property and the use, sale, storage and handling of chemicals and hazardous products subject us to extensive and changing U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, as well as those ofother countries, pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, enforcement, disposition of wastes (including hazardous wastes), the use, shipping, labeling, and storage of chemicals and hazardous materials, building requirements, orotherwise relating to protection of the environment. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations. In addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws andregulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become subject to new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    We use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations. In addition, many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we monitorhazardous waste management and applicable environmental permitting and reporting for compliance with applicable laws at our locations in the ordinary course of our business. We may be subject to potential material liabilities relating to anyinvestigation and clean-up of our locations or properties where we delivered hazardous waste for handling or disposal that may be contaminated or which may have been contaminated prior to our purchase, and to claims alleging personal injury.   High jet fuel and other energy prices mayimpact our operating results. Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of operating expenses for companies in the aerospace industry. Widespread disruption to oil production, refinery operations and pipeline capacity in certain areas of theUnited States can increase the price of jet fuel significantly. Conflicts in the Middle East, an important source of oil for the U.S. and other countries where we do business, cause prices for fuel to be volatile and often significantly higher thanhistoric levels. Because many of our customers and we are in the aerospace industry, increased fuel costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. The price of energy generally impacts the cost ofoperating our manufacturing and distribution operations. We have experienced significant increases in energy costs, and energy costs could continue to rise, which would result in higher transportation, freight and other operating costs. We cannotguarantee that we will be able to pass along energy costs to our customers through increased prices.   11 Table of ContentsProducts and services of the mature industries in which we operate may be renderedobsolete by new products, technologies and processes. Our manufacturing operations focus on highly engineered components which require extensive engineering and research and development time. Our competitive advantage may be adversely impactedif we cannot continue to introduce new products ahead of our competition, or if our products are rendered obsolete by other products or by new, different technologies and processes. Additionally, we may face increased or unexpected costs associatedwith new product introduction including the use of additional resources such as personnel.    RISKS RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING, ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES AND JOINT VENTURES   Our acquisition and divestiture strategies may not be successful. We have made a number of acquisitions in the past and weanticipate that we may, from time to time, acquire additional businesses, assets or securities of companies that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our businesses. A significant portion of the industries that we serve are matureindustries. As a result, our future growth may depend in part on the successful acquisition and integration of businesses into our existing operations. We may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions, obtain financingfor future acquisitions on satisfactory terms, obtain regulatory approvals or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future. We have also in the past divested assets and businesses. We may in the future engage in discussions with potential acquirersof certain of our assets or businesses in order to meet our strategic objectives, but we cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in finding suitable purchasers for any such desired sale of such assets or businesses.   We will need to integrate any acquired businesses with ourexisting operations. We cannot assure you that we will effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business or product offerings or realize anticipated operational synergies. In connection with theintegration of acquired operations or the conduct of our overall business strategies, we may periodically restructure our businesses and/or sell assets or portions of our business. Integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies intoour existing operations may result in difficulties, significant expense and accounting charges, disrupt our business or divert managements time and attention.  Acquisitions involve numerous other risks, includingpotential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business. In connection with acquisitions or joint venture investments outside the U.S., we may enter intoderivative contracts to purchase foreign currency in order to hedge against the risk of foreign currency fluctuations in connection with such acquisitions or joint venture investments, which subjects us to the risk of foreign currency fluctuationsassociated with such derivative contracts. Additionally, our final determinations and appraisals of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions may vary materially from earlier estimates. We cannot assure you thatthe fair value of acquired businesses will remain constant.    If we engage in a divestiture of assets or a business, we cannot be certain that our business, operating results and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected. A successfuldivestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to any purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual propertythat we wish to retain, reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business, and collect the proceeds from any divestitures. In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service fromthe new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other products offered by us. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention fromother business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of any divestiture transaction, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. In addition, divestitures ofbusinesses involve a number of risks, including the   12 Table of Contentsdiversion of management and employee attention, significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships, and a decrease in revenues and earnings associated with the divested business.Furthermore, divestitures potentially involve significant post-closing separation activities, which could involve the expenditure of significant financial and employee resources.   We may not achieve expected cost savings from restructuringactivities and actual charges, costs and adjustments due to restructuring activities may vary materially from our estimates. Our ability to realize anticipated cost savings, synergies and revenue enhancements may be affected by a number of factors,including the following: our ability to effectively eliminate duplicative back office overhead and overlapping sales personnel, rationalize manufacturing capacity, synchronize information technology systems, consolidate warehousing and distributionfacilities and shift production to more economical facilities; significant cash and non-cash integration and implementation costs or charges in order to achieve those cost savings, which could offset any such savings and other synergies resultingfrom our acquisitions or divestitures; and our ability to avoid labor disruption in connection with integration efforts or divestitures.  Any joint ventures or teaming arrangements we enter into may not be successful. We may enter into joint ventures or teamingarrangements. Partners with whom we share control may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the joint venture or arrangement. Our joint venture or teaming arrangementsmay require us to pay certain costs or to make certain capital investments and we may have little control over the amount or the timing of these payments and investments. In addition, our joint venture or teaming partners may be unable to meet theireconomic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. Our failure or the failure of an entity in which we have a joint venture interest or teaming arrangement to adequately manage the risks associated with anyacquisitions, joint ventures or teaming arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We cannot assure you that any of our joint ventures or teaming arrangements will be profitable or thatforecasts regarding joint venture or teaming activities will be accurate. In particular, risks and uncertainties associated with our joint ventures and teaming arrangements include, among others, the joint ventures or teaming partnersability to operate its business successfully, to develop appropriate standards, controls, procedures and policies for the growth and management of the joint venture or teaming arrangement and the strength of the their relationships with employees,suppliers and customers.   "
16,B,BARNES GROUP INC,2010-02-22,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
    Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Please note thatadditional risks not presently known to us may also materially impact our business and operations.    RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS    We depend on revenues and earnings from a small number of significant customers. Any bankruptcy of or loss, cancellation, reduction or delay in purchases by these customers could harm our business.In 2009, our net sales to General Electric and its subsidiaries accounted for 21% of our total sales and approximately 16% and 27% of sales at Logistics and Manufacturing Services and Precision Components, respectively. Additionally,approximately 18% of Precision Components sales in 2009 were to its next five largest customers. Some of our success will depend on the economic viability of those customers. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our largestcustomers. A tightening in the credit markets may affect our customers ability to raise debt or equity capital. This may reduce the amount of liquidity available to our customers which may limit their ability to purchase products. Some of ourcustomers may in the future reduce their purchases due to economic conditions or shift their purchases from us to our competitors, in-house or to other sources. Some of our long-term sales agreements provide that until a firm order is placed by acustomer for a particular product, the customer may unilaterally reduce or discontinue its projected purchases without penalty, or terminate for convenience. The loss of one or more of our largest customers, any reduction or delay in sales to thesecustomers, our inability to successfully develop relationships with new customers, or future price concessions we make to retain customers could significantly reduce our sales and profitability.    We have significant indebtedness that could affect ouroperations and financial condition. At December 31, 2009, we had consolidated debt and capitalized lease obligations of $351.5 million, representing approximately 34% of our total capital (indebtedness plus stockholders equity) as ofthat date. Our level of indebtedness and the significant debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operations and financial condition and may adversely affect the value or trading price of ouroutstanding equity securities and debt securities. For example, our indebtedness could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flows availablefor working capital, capital expenditures, investments in technology and research and development, acquisitions, dividends and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industries inwhich we compete; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors, some of whom have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources than we do; limit our ability to borrow additional funds; or increase ourvulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. In addition, current conditions in the worldwide credit markets place significant limitations on our ability to expand our credit lines beyond current bank commitments. Also, thefragile nature of the worldwide banking industry raises concerns that even current bank commitments may be at risk.    Our failure to meet certain financial covenants required by our debt agreements may materially and adversely affect our assets, financialposition and cash flows. Some of our debt arrangements require us to maintain certain interest coverage and leverage ratios and a minimum net worth and limit our ability to incur debt, make investments or undertake certain other businessactivities. These requirements could limit our ability to obtain future financing and may prevent us from taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. Our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our debt arrangements maybe affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the restrictions could result in an event of default under our debt  4 Table of Contentsarrangements which, in turn, could result in an event of default under the terms of our other indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our debt arrangements, after theexpiration of any grace periods, our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our debt arrangements, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to happen, we cannot assure you that our assetswould be sufficient to repay in full the payments due under those arrangements or our other indebtedness.    Our operations depend on our manufacturing, distribution, sales and service facilities, and information systems in various parts of theworld which are subject to physical, financial, regulatory, operational and other risks that could disrupt our operations. During 2009, approximately 40% of our sales were from facilities outside of the United States. Also, we have a number ofmanufacturing facilities and distribution/sales centers outside the United States. The international scope of our business subjects us to risks such as threats of war, terrorism and instability of governments, and economic and legal systems incountries in which we or our customers conduct business. In addition, because we depend upon our information systems to help process orders, to manage inventory and accounts receivable collections, to purchase, sell and ship products efficiently andon a timely basis, to maintain cost-effective operations, and to help provide superior service to our customers, any disruption or failure in the operation of our information systems, including from conversions or integrations, could have a materialadverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Some of our facilities are located in areas that may be affected by natural disasters, including earthquakes or tsunamis, which could cause significant damageand disruption to the operations of those facilities and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, some of our manufacturing equipment and tooling iscustom-made and is not readily replaceable. Loss of such equipment or tooling could have a negative impact on our manufacturing business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    Although we have obtained property damage and businessinterruption insurance, a major catastrophe such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, tsunami or other natural disaster at any of our sites, or significant labor strikes, work stoppages, political unrest, or any of the events described above, some ofwhich may not be covered by our insurance, in any of the areas where we conduct operations could result in a prolonged interruption of our business. Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in the manufacture orshipment of products or the provision of repair and other services that may result in our loss of sales and customers. Our insurance will not cover all potential risks, and we cannot assure you that we will have adequate insurance to compensate usfor all losses that result from any insured risks. Any material loss not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We cannot assure you that insurance will beavailable in the future at a cost acceptable to us or at a cost that will not have a material adverse effect on our profitability, net income and cash flows.    The global nature of our business exposes us to foreign currency fluctuations that may affect our future revenues and profitability.We have manufacturing, sales and distribution facilities around the world, and the majority of our foreign operations use the local currency as their functional currency. These include, among others, the Brazilian real, British pound sterling,Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, Euro, Korean won, Mexican peso, Singapore dollar, Swedish krona, Swiss franc and Thai baht. Since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar andother currencies expose us to translation risk when the local currency financial statements are translated to U.S. dollars. Changes in currency exchange rates may also expose us to transaction risk. We may buy protecting or offsetting positions orhedges in certain currencies to reduce our exposure to currency exchange fluctuations; however, these transactions may not be adequate or effective to protect us from the exposure for which they are purchased. We have not engaged in any speculativehedging activities. Currency fluctuations may impact our revenues and profitability in the future.    Our operations and assets subject us to additional financial and regulatory risks. We have operations and assets in various parts ofthe world. In addition, we sell our products and services to the U.S. government and in foreign countries. Accordingly, we are subject to various risks, including: U.S.-imposed embargoes of sales to  5 Table of Contentsspecific countries; foreign import controls (which may be arbitrarily imposed or enforced); import regulations and duties; export regulations (which require us to comply with stringent licensingregimes); anti-dumping regulations; price and currency controls; exchange rate fluctuations; dividend remittance restrictions; expropriation of assets; war, civil uprisings and riots; government instability; requirements to provide certifications tothe government with respect to compliance with government requirements; the necessity of obtaining governmental approval for new and continuing products and operations; legal systems or decrees, laws, taxes, regulations, interpretations and courtdecisions that are not always fully developed and that may be retroactively or arbitrarily applied; and difficulties in managing a global enterprise. We have experienced inadvertent violations of some of these regulations, including exportregulations, product labeling regulations, and regulations prohibiting air transport of aerosol products, in the past, none of which has had or, we believe, will have a material adverse effect on our business. However, any significant violations ofthese regulations in the future could result in civil or criminal sanctions, and the loss of export or other licenses which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may also be subject to unanticipated income taxes, excise duties,import taxes, export taxes or other governmental assessments, and taxes may be impacted by changes in legislation in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, our organizational structure may limit our ability to transfer funds betweencountries, particularly into and out of the United States, without incurring adverse tax consequences. Any of these events could result in a loss of business or other unexpected costs that could reduce sales or profits and have a material adverseeffect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    Our ability to recover our significant deferred tax assets related to tax operating loss carryforwards depends on future income. We have significant deferred tax assets related to operating losscarryforwards. The realization of these assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income during the operating loss carryforward period. Failure to realize this tax benefit could have a material adverse effect on our financialcondition and results of operations.    Changesin the availability or price of materials, products and energy resources could adversely affect our costs and profitability. We may be adversely affected by the availability or price of raw materials, products and energy resources, particularlyrelated to certain manufacturing operations that utilize high-grade steel spring wire and titanium. The availability and price of raw materials and energy resources may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, new laws orregulations, global economic or political events including strikes, terrorist attacks and war, suppliers allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. In someinstances there are limited sources for raw materials and a limited number of primary suppliers for some of our products for resale. Although we are not dependent upon any single source for any of our principal raw materials or products for resale,and such materials and products have, historically, been readily available, we cannot assure you that such raw materials and products will continue to be readily available. Disruption in the supply of raw materials, products or energy resources orour inability to come to favorable agreements with our suppliers could impair our ability to manufacture, sell and deliver our products and require us to pay higher prices. Any increase in prices for such raw materials, products or energy resourcescould materially adversely affect our costs and our profitability.    We maintain pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the U.S. and certain international locations. Declines in the stock market, prevailing interest rates and rising medical costs maycause an increase in our pension and other postretirement benefit expenses in the future and result in reductions in our pension fund asset values and increases in our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. These changes have causedand may continue to cause a significant reduction in our net worth and may require us to make higher cash contributions to our pension and postretirement plans in the future.    We have significant goodwill and an impairment of our goodwill could cause a decline in our net worth.Our total assets include substantial goodwill. At December 31, 2009, our goodwill totaled $373.6 million. The goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of the purchase price we paid over the net assets of the companiesacquired. We assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill  6 Table of Contentsduring each calendar year or sooner if triggering events warrant. If future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units does not meet expectations or fair values fall due tosignificant stock market declines, we may be required to reflect a non-cash charge to operating results for goodwill impairment. The recognition of an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect our results of operationsand total capitalization, the effect of which could be material.    We could be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. Our profitability may be adversely affected as a result of increases in interest rates. At December 31, 2009, we and oursubsidiaries had approximately $351.5 million aggregate principal amount of consolidated debt and capitalized lease obligations outstanding, of which approximately 54% had interest rates that float with the market. A 100 basis point increase in theinterest rate on the floating rate debt in effect at December 31, 2009 would have resulted in an approximate $2.5 million annualized increase in interest expense.    We may not realize all of the sales expected from our existing backlog or anticipated orders. At December 31,2009, we had $428 million of order backlog. There can be no assurances that the revenues projected in our backlog will be realized or, if realized, will result in profits. We consider backlog to be firm customer orders for future delivery. From timeto time, OEM customers of Precision Components provide projections of components and assemblies that they anticipate purchasing in the future under new and existing programs. Such projections are not included in our backlog unless we have received afirm release from our customers. Our customers may have the right under certain circumstances and with certain penalties or consequences to terminate, reduce or defer firm orders that we have in backlog. If our customers terminate, reduce or deferfirm orders, we may be protected from certain costs and losses, but our sales will nevertheless be adversely affected. Although we strive to maintain ongoing relationships with our customers, there is an ongoing risk that orders may be cancelled orrescheduled due to fluctuations in our customers business needs or purchasing budgets.    Also, our realization of sales from new and existing programs is inherently subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties, including whether our customers will execute the launch of productprograms on time, or at all, the number of units that our customers will actually produce and the timing of production. In addition, until firm orders are placed, our customers generally have the right to discontinue a program or replace us withanother supplier at any time without penalty. Our failure to realize sales from new and existing programs could have a material adverse effect on our net sales, results of operations and cash flows.    We may not recover all of our up-front costs related to newor existing programs. New programs require significant up-front investments for capital equipment, engineering, design and tooling. As OEMs in the transportation and aerospace industries have looked to suppliers to bear increasing responsibilityfor the design, engineering and manufacture of systems and components, they have increasingly shifted the financial risk associated with those responsibilities to the suppliers as well. This trend is likely to continue and is most evident in thearea of engineering cost reimbursement. Historically, these investments have been fully reimbursed by OEMs, but in the future there may be other mechanisms established by OEMs that could result in less than full reimbursement or no reimbursement. Wecannot assure you that we will have adequate funds to make such up-front investments. In the event that we are unable to make such investments, or to recover them through sales or direct reimbursement from our customers, our profitability, liquidityand cash flows may be adversely affected. In addition, we incur costs and make capital expenditures for new program awards based upon certain estimates of production volumes. While we attempt to recover such costs and capital expenditures byappropriately pricing our products, the prices of our products are based in part upon planned production volumes. If the actual production is significantly less than planned, we may be unable to recover such costs. In addition, because a significantportion of our overall costs is fixed, declines in our customers production levels can adversely affect the level of our reported profits even if our up-front investments are recovered.    We may not recover all of our up-front costs related to RSPs.Our total investments in RSP participation fees as of December 31, 2009 equaled $293.7 million, all of which have been paid. We participate in aftermarket RSPs under which we receive an exclusive right to supply designated aftermarket partsto a large aerospace  7 Table of Contentsmanufacturer over the life of an aircraft engine program. As consideration, we pay participation fees, which are recorded as long-lived intangible assets and are recognized as a reduction tosales over the life of the program. The recoverability of the asset is dependent upon future revenues related to the programs aftermarket parts and is subject to impairment testing whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carryingamount may not be recoverable. The potential exists that actual revenues will not meet expectations. A shortfall in future revenues may result in the failure to recover the total amount of the investments, which could adversely affect our financialcondition and results of operations and cash flows.    We face risks of cost overruns and losses on fixed-price contracts. We sell certain of our products under firm, fixed-price contracts providing for a fixed price for the products regardless of the production or purchase costsincurred by us. The cost of producing products may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, outside processing, overhead and other factors, including manufacturing inefficiencies. Increased production costs mayresult in cost overruns and losses on contracts.    The departure of existing management and key personnel, a shortage of skilled employees or a lack of qualified sales professionals could materially affect our business, operations and prospects. Our executive officers are importantto the management and direction of our business. Our future success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain or replace these officers and other capable management personnel. Although we believe we will be able to attract and retain talentedpersonnel and replace key personnel should the need arise, our inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Because of the complex nature of many of our productsand services, we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilled workforce. In addition, there are significant costs associated with the hiring and training of sales professionals. We could be adversely affected by a shortage of availableskilled employees or the loss of a significant number of our sales professionals.    Any product liability claims in excess of insurance may adversely affect our financial condition. Our operations expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design,manufacture and sale of our products and the products we buy from third parties and sell to our customers. For example, we may be exposed to potential liability for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of a spring or other part in avehicle or an aircraft component designed, manufactured or sold by us, or the failure of an aircraft component that has been serviced by us or of the components themselves, including potentially hazardous substances in a product purchased by us andsold by us to one of our customers. While we believe that our liability insurance is adequate to protect us from these liabilities, our insurance may not cover all liabilities. Additionally, insurance coverage may not be available in the future at acost acceptable to us. Any material liability not covered by insurance or for which third-party indemnification is not available could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    Our business, financial condition, results of operations andcash flows could be adversely impacted by strikes or work stoppages. As of December 31, 2009, approximately 13% of our U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and 45% of our non-U.S. employees are covered bycollective bargaining agreements or statutory trade union agreements. In 2010, the National Healthcare and Pension Agreement, which covers approximately 300 employees at our Bristol, Connecticut; Corry, Pennsylvania; and Saline, Michigan facilities,as well as the collective bargaining agreement covering approximately 30 employees at our Burlington, Canada facility, will be open for bargaining. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are good, we cannot assure you that we willbe successful in our bargaining position, or that such bargaining will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor, including healthcare, pensions or other benefits. Any potential strikes or work stoppages, and the resulting adverseimpact on our relationships with customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Similarly, a protracted strike or work stoppage at any of our major customers, suppliers orother vendors could materially adversely affect our business.   8 Table of ContentsRISKS RELATED TO THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE    A general economic downturn could adversely affect ourbusiness and financial results. All of our businesses are impacted by the health of the economies in which they operate. A decline in economies in which we operate could reduce demand for our products and services or increase pricing pressures,thereby having an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We derive a large portion of our sales from the transportation industry. This industry has suffered from financial pressures which have hadnegative consequences for companies in, and companies with customers in, the transportation industry. The transportation industry has generally suffered from unfavorable pricing pressures in North America and other regions. The operation of ourbusiness within that industry subjects us to the pressures applicable to all companies operating in it. While the precise effects of such instability on the transportation industry are difficult to determine, they may negatively impact our business,financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    We operate in very competitive markets. We may not be able to compete effectively with our competitors, and competitive pressures could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our two globalbusiness segments compete with a number of larger and smaller companies in the markets we serve. Some of our competitors have greater financial, production, research and development, or other resources than we do. Within the aerospace aftermarketbusiness unit, certain of our OEM customers compete with our repair and overhaul business. Some of our OEM customers in the aerospace industry also compete with us where they have the ability to manufacture the components and assemblies that wesupply to them but have chosen, for capacity limitations, cost considerations or other reasons, to outsource the manufacturing to us. Our two business segments compete on the basis of price, service, quality, reliability of supply, technology,innovation and design. The products sold by Logistics and Manufacturing Services are not unique, and its competitors carry substantially similar products. We must continue to make investments to maintain and improve our competitive position. Wecannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or that we will be successful in maintaining our competitive position. Our competitors may develop products or services, or methods of delivering thoseproducts or services, that are superior to our products, services or methods. Our competitors may also adapt more quickly than we to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. Pricing pressures could cause us to adjust the prices of certainof our products to stay competitive. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with our existing or future competitors. Also, if consolidation of our existing competitors occurs, we expect the competitive pressures we face toincrease. Our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    Our customers businesses are generally cyclical. Weaknesses in the industries in which our customers operate could impact ourrevenues and profitability. The industries to which we sell tend to decline in response to overall declines in industrial production. The OEM aerospace unit of Precision Components and the aftermarket aerospace unit of Logistics andManufacturing Services are heavily dependent on the commercial aerospace industry, which is cyclical. In addition, parts of both Precision Components, and Logistics and Manufacturing Services are dependent on the transportation industry, and generalindustrial and tooling markets, all of which are also cyclical. Many of our customers have historically experienced periodic downturns, which often have had a negative effect on demand for our products.    Original equipment manufacturers in the transportation andaerospace industries have significant pricing leverage over suppliers and may be able to achieve price reductions over time. There is substantial and continuing pressure from OEMs in the transportation, including automotive and aerospace,industries to reduce the prices they pay to suppliers. We attempt to manage such downward pricing pressure, while trying to preserve our business relationships with our customers, by seeking to reduce our production costs through various measures,including purchasing raw materials and components at lower prices and implementing cost-effective process improvements. Our suppliers have periodically resisted, and in the future may resist, pressure to lower their prices and may seek to imposeprice increases. In the past, our efforts to convince our key transportation OEM customers to share in raw material price increases were met with partial success. If we are  9 Table of Contentsunable to offset OEM price reductions through these measures, our profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, OEMs have substantial leverage in setting purchasing andpayment terms, including the terms of accelerated payment programs under which payments are made prior to the account due date in return for an early payment discount. OEMs can unexpectedly change their purchasing policies or payment practices,which could have a negative impact on our short-term working capital.    Demand for our defense-related products depends on government spending. A portion of the Precision Components aerospace units sales are derived from the military market. The military marketis largely dependent upon government budgets and is subject to governmental appropriations. Although multi-year contracts may be authorized in connection with major procurements, funds are generally appropriated on a fiscal year basis even though aprogram may be expected to continue for several years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded and additional funds are committed only as further appropriations are made. We cannot assure you that an increase in defense spending willbe allocated to programs that would benefit our business. Moreover, we cannot assure you that new military aircraft programs in which we participate will enter full-scale production as expected. A decrease in levels of defense spending or thegovernments termination of, or failure to fully fund, one or more of the contracts for the programs in which we participate could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.    The consolidation occurring in the industries in which weoperate could adversely affect our business and financial results. The industries in which we operate have been experiencing consolidation. There has been consolidation of both suppliers and the customers we serve. Supplier consolidation is inpart attributable to OEMs more frequently awarding long-term sole source or preferred supplier contracts to the most capable suppliers in an effort to reduce the total number of suppliers from whom components and systems are purchased. We cannotassure you that our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows will not be adversely impacted as a result of consolidation by our competitors or customers.    The aerospace industry is highly regulated. Complications related to aerospace regulations may adverselyaffect the Company. A substantial portion of our income is derived from our aerospace businesses. The aerospace industry is highly regulated in the United States by the Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, and in other countries by similarregulatory agencies. We must be certified by these agencies and, in some cases, by individual OEMs in order to engineer and service systems and components used in specific aircraft models. If material authorizations or approvals were delayed,revoked or suspended, our business could be adversely affected. New or more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted, or industry oversight heightened, in the future, and we may incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulationsor any heightened industry oversight.    Environmental regulations impose costs and regulatory requirements on our operations. Environmental compliance may be more costly than we expect, and we may be subject to material environmental-based claims in the future. Our pastand present business operations and past and present ownership and operations of real property and the use, sale, storage and handling of chemicals and hazardous products subject us to extensive and changing U.S. federal, state and localenvironmental laws and regulations, as well as those of other countries, pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, enforcement, disposition of wastes (including hazardous wastes), the use, shipping, labeling, and storage ofchemicals and hazardous materials, or otherwise relating to protection of the environment. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations. In addition, new laws and regulations,stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become subject to new or increased liabilities that could havea material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    We use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations. In addition, many of our current and former properties are or havebeen used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we monitor hazardous waste management and applicable environmental permitting and reporting for compliance with applicable laws at our  10 Table of Contentslocations in the ordinary course of our business. We may be subject to potential material liabilities relating to any investigation and clean-up of our locations or properties where we deliveredhazardous waste for handling or disposal that may be contaminated, and to claims alleging personal injury.    High fuel prices may impact our operating results. Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of operating expenses for companies inthe aerospace industry. Widespread disruption to oil production, refinery operations and pipeline capacity in certain areas of the United States can increase the price of jet fuel significantly. Conflicts in the Middle East, an important source ofoil for the U.S. and other countries where we do business, cause prices for fuel to be volatile and often significantly higher than historic levels. Because many of our customers and we are in the aerospace industry, increased fuel costs could havea material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. The price of fuel generally impacts the cost of operating our manufacturing and distribution operations. Additionally, higher fuel costs may increase our freightexpenses.    Products and services of the matureindustries in which we operate may be rendered obsolete by new products, technologies and processes. Our manufacturing operations focus on highly engineered components which require extensive engineering and research and development time. Ourcompetitive advantage may be adversely impacted if we cannot continue to introduce new products ahead of our competition, or if our products are rendered obsolete by other products or by new, different technologies and processes.    RISKS RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS    We may not be able to effectively integrate acquiredcompanies into our operations. We completed 15 acquisitions between 1999 and 2006. We seek acquisition opportunities that complement and expand our operations and that will help create stockholder value over the long term. We cannot assure youthat we will be able to effectively integrate our acquisitions into our operations. We may not be able to do so successfully without substantial costs, delays or other difficulties. We could face significant challenges in consolidating functions andintegrating procedures, information technology systems, personnel, product lines and operations in a timely and efficient manner. We may encounter difficulties in training our sales forces to work with new products and customers.    The integration process is complex and time-consuming, may bedisruptive to our businesses, and may cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our businesses as a result of a number of obstacles, such as: the loss of significant customers; the need to retrain skilled engineering, sales and otherpersonnel resulting from the loss of key employees; the failure to maintain the quality of customer service that each business has historically provided; the need to coordinate geographically diverse organizations; retooling and reprogramming ofequipment and information technology systems; and the resulting diversion of managements attention from our day-to-day business and the need to hire additional management personnel to address integration obstacles.    If we are not successful in integrating our acquisitions intoour operations, if the integration takes longer than anticipated, if the companies or assets we acquire do not perform as we anticipate, or if the integrated product and service offerings fail to achieve market acceptance, our business, financialposition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.    We may not be able to realize the anticipated cost savings, synergies or revenue enhancements from acquisitions, and we may incur significant costs to achieve these savings. Even if we are able tointegrate successfully our operations and the operations of our acquisitions, we may not be able to realize the cost savings, synergies or revenue enhancements that we anticipate from these acquisitions, either as to amount or in the time frame thatwe expect. Our ability to realize anticipated cost savings, synergies and revenue enhancements may be affected by a number of factors, including the following: our ability to effectively eliminate duplicative back office overhead and overlappingsales personnel, rationalize manufacturing capacity, synchronize information technology systems, consolidate warehousing and distribution facilities and shift production to more economical facilities; significant cash and non-cash integration andimplementation costs or charges in order to achieve those  11 Table of Contentscost savings, which could offset any such savings and other synergies resulting from our acquisitions; and our ability to avoid labor disruption in connection with integration efforts. Inaddition, our growth to date has placed, and future acquisitions could continue to place, significant demand on our administrative, operational, information technology and financial resources.    Future acquisitions and strategic alliances are a keycomponent of our anticipated growth. We may not be able to identify or complete future acquisitions or strategic alliances. Turmoil in the equity and credit markets may limit our ability to undertake acquisitions. A significant portion of theindustries that we serve are mature industries. As a result, our future growth may depend in part on the successful acquisition and integration of businesses into our existing operations. While we are focused on adding strategic pieces to ouroperations by acquiring companies, manufacturing and service assets and technologies that complement our existing businesses, we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions, obtain financing for future acquisitionson satisfactory terms, obtain regulatory approval or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future. In addition, opportunities to enter into additional aftermarket RSPs or alliances may be limited. Aftermarket RSPs will have an impact on the rate offuture growth and profitability as a result of the business mix, the number of new RSPs entered into, the level of aftermarket volume, increasing management fees, the amortization of the participation fees, and the expiration of the SingaporePioneer tax incentives on these programs.   "
9,B,BARNES GROUP INC,2009-02-24,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
    Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.Please note that additional risks not presently known to us may also materially impact our business and operations.    RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS    We depend on revenues and earnings from a small number of significant customers. Any bankruptcy of or loss, cancellation, reduction or delay inpurchases by these customers could harm our business. In 2008, our net sales to General Electric and its subsidiaries accounted for 18% of our total sales and approximately 15% and 22% of sales at Logistics and Manufacturing Services andPrecision Components, respectively. Additionally, approximately 14% of Precision Components sales in 2008 were to its next three largest customers. Some of our success will depend on the economic viability of those customers. We cannot assureyou that we will be able to retain our largest customers. There has been tightening in the credit markets which may affect our customers ability to raise debt or equity capital. This may reduce the amount of liquidity available to ourcustomers which may limit their ability to purchase products. Some of our customers may in the future reduce their purchases due to economic conditions or shift their purchases from us to our competitors, in-house or to other sources. Our long-termsales agreements provide that until a firm order is placed by a customer for a particular product, the customer may unilaterally reduce or discontinue its projected purchases without penalty. The loss of one or more of our largest customers, anyreduction or delay in sales to these customers, our inability to successfully develop relationships with new customers, or future price concessions we make to retain customers could significantly reduce our sales and profitability. The potentialbankruptcy of our largest customers in the automotive industry could result in our inability to recover our investments in certain accounts receivable and inventory.    We have significant indebtedness that could affect our operations and financial condition. At December 31, 2008,we had consolidated debt and capitalized lease obligations of $493.4 million, representing approximately 46% of our total capital (indebtedness plus stockholders equity) as of that date. Our level of indebtedness and the significant debtservicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operations and financial condition and may adversely affect the value or trading price of our outstanding equity securities and debt securities. For example, ourindebtedness could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, investments in technologyand research and development, acquisitions, dividends and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industries in which we compete; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to ourcompetitors, some of whom have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources than we do; limit our ability to borrow additional funds; or increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. In addition,current conditions in the worldwide credit markets place significant limitations on our ability to expand our credit lines beyond current bank commitments. Also, the fragile nature of the worldwide banking industry raises concerns that even currentbank commitments may be at risk.    Our failure to meetcertain financial covenants required by our debt agreements may materially and adversely affect our assets, financial position and cash flows. Some of our debt arrangements require us to maintain certain interest coverage and leverage ratios anda minimum net worth and limit our ability to incur debt, make investments or undertake certain other business activities. These requirements could limit our ability to obtain future financing and may prevent us from taking advantage of attractivebusiness opportunities. Our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our debt arrangements may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach ofthese covenants or our inability to comply with the restrictions could result in an event of default under our debt arrangements which, in turn, could result in an event of default under the terms of our other indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of anevent of default under our debt arrangements, after the expiration of any grace periods, our   4 Table of Contentslenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our debt arrangements, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. Ifthis were to happen, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the payments due under those arrangements or our other indebtedness.    Our operations depend on our manufacturing, distribution, sales and service facilities in various parts of the worldwhich are subject to physical, financial, regulatory and other risks that could disrupt our operations. During 2008, approximately 42% of our sales were from facilities outside of the United States. Also, we have a number of manufacturingfacilities and distribution/sales centers outside the United States. The international scope of our business subjects us to risks such as threats of war, terrorism and instability of governments, and economic and legal systems in countries in whichwe or our customers conduct business. In addition, because we depend upon our information systems to help process orders, to manage inventory and accounts receivable collections, to purchase, sell and ship products efficiently and on a timely basis,to maintain cost-effective operations, and to help provide superior service to our customers, any disruption in the operation of our information systems, including widespread power outages, could have a material adverse effect on our business,financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Some of our facilities are located in areas that may be affected by natural disasters, including earthquakes or tsunamis, which could cause significant damage and disruption to theoperations of those facilities and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, some of our manufacturing equipment and tooling is custom-made and is notreadily replaceable. Loss of such equipment or tooling could have a negative impact on our manufacturing business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    Although we have obtained property damage and business interruption insurance, a major catastrophe such as an earthquake,hurricane, flood, tsunami or other natural disaster at any of our sites, or significant labor strikes, work stoppages, political unrest, or any of the events described above, some of which may not be covered by our insurance, in any of the areaswhere we conduct operations could result in a prolonged interruption of our business. Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in the manufacture or shipment of products or the provision of repair and other servicesthat may result in our loss of sales and customers. Our insurance will not cover all potential risks, and we cannot assure you that we will have adequate insurance to compensate us for all losses that result from any insured risks. Any material lossnot covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We cannot assure you that insurance will be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us or at a cost that will nothave a material adverse effect on our profitability, net income and cash flows.    The global nature of our business exposes us to foreign currency fluctuations that may affect our future revenues and profitability. We have manufacturing, sales and distribution facilities around the world,and the majority of our foreign operations use the local currency as their functional currency. These include, among others, the Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, Euro, Korean won, Mexican peso, Singapore dollar,Swedish krona, Swiss franc and Thai baht. Since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies expose us to translation risk when the local currency financialstatements are translated to U.S. dollars. Changes in currency exchange rates may also expose us to transaction risk. We may buy protecting or offsetting positions or hedges in certain currencies to reduce our exposure to currency exchangefluctuations; however, these transactions may not be adequate or effective to protect us from the exposure for which they are purchased. We have not engaged in any speculative hedging activities. Currency fluctuations may impact our revenues andprofitability in the future.    Our operations and assetssubject us to additional financial and regulatory risks. We have operations and assets in various parts of the world. In addition, we sell our products and services to the U.S. government and in foreign countries. Accordingly, we are subject tovarious risks, including: U.S.-imposed embargoes of sales to specific countries; foreign import controls (which may be arbitrarily imposed or enforced); import regulations and duties; export regulations (which require us to comply with stringentlicensing regimes); anti-dumping regulations; price and currency controls; exchange rate fluctuations; dividend remittance restrictions;   5 Table of Contentsexpropriation of assets; war, civil uprisings and riots; government instability; requirements to provide certifications to the government with respect tocompliance with government requirements; the necessity of obtaining governmental approval for new and continuing products and operations; legal systems or decrees, laws, taxes, regulations, interpretations and court decisions that are not alwaysfully developed and that may be retroactively or arbitrarily applied; and difficulties in managing a global enterprise. We have experienced inadvertent violations of some of these regulations, including export regulations and regulations prohibitingair transport of aerosol products, in the past, none of which has had or, we believe, will have a material adverse effect on our business. However, any significant violations of these regulations in the future could result in civil or criminalsanctions, and the loss of export or other licenses which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may also be subject to unanticipated income taxes, excise duties, import taxes, export taxes or other governmental assessments. Inaddition, our organizational structure may limit our ability to transfer funds between countries, particularly into and out of the United States, without incurring adverse tax consequences. Any of these events could result in a loss of business orother unexpected costs that could reduce sales or profits and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.   Our ability to recover our significant deferred tax assets related to tax operating loss carryforwards depends on future income. We havesignificant deferred tax assets related to operating loss carryforwards. The realization of these assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income during the operating loss carryforward period. Failure to realize this tax benefitcould have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.    Changes in the availability or price of materials, products and energy resources could adversely affect our costs and profitability. We may be adversely affected by the availability or price of raw materials,products and energy resources, particularly related to certain manufacturing operations that utilize high-grade steel spring wire and titanium. The availability and price of raw materials and energy resources may be subject to curtailment or changedue to, among other things, new laws or regulations, global economic or political events including strikes, terrorist attacks and war, suppliers allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchangerates and prevailing price levels. In some instances there are limited sources for raw materials and a limited number of primary suppliers for some of our products for resale. Although we are not dependent upon any single source for any of ourprincipal raw materials or products for resale, and such materials and products have, historically, been readily available, we cannot assure you that such raw materials and products will continue to be readily available. Disruption in the supply ofraw materials, products or energy resources or our inability to come to favorable agreements with our suppliers could impair our ability to manufacture, sell and deliver our products and require us to pay higher prices. Any increase in prices forsuch raw materials, products or energy resources could materially adversely affect our costs and our profitability.    We maintain pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the U.S. and certain international locations. Declines in the stock market,prevailing interest rates and rising medical costs may cause an increase in our pension and other postretirement benefit expenses in the future and result in reductions in our pension fund asset values and increases in our pension and otherpostretirement benefit obligations. These changes have caused and may continue to cause a significant reduction in our net worth and may require us to make higher cash contributions to our pension and postretirement plans in the future.   We have significant goodwill and an impairment of our goodwill couldcause a decline in our net worth. Our total assets include substantial goodwill. At December 31, 2008, our goodwill totaled $361.9 million. The goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of the purchase price we paidover the net assets of the companies acquired. We assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill during each calendar year or sooner if triggering events warrant. If future operating performance at one or more of ourbusinesses does not meet expectations or fair values fall due to significant stock market declines, we may be required to reflect a non-cash charge to operating results for goodwill impairment. The recognition of an impairment of a significantportion of goodwill would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material.   6 Table of ContentsWe could be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. Our profitability may be adverselyaffected as a result of increases in interest rates. At December 31, 2008, we and our subsidiaries had approximately $493.4 million aggregate principal amount of consolidated debt and capitalized lease obligations outstanding, of whichapproximately 53% had interest rates that float with the market. A 100 basis point increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in effect at December 31, 2008 would have resulted in an approximate $2.6 million annualized increase ininterest expense.    We may not realize all of the salesexpected from our existing backlog or anticipated orders. At December 31, 2008, we had $454 million of order backlog. There can be no assurances that the revenues projected in our backlog will be realized or, if realized, will result inprofits. We consider backlog to be firm customer orders for future delivery. From time to time, OEM customers of Precision Components provide projections of components and assemblies that they anticipate purchasing in the future under new andexisting programs. Such projections are not included in our backlog unless we have received a firm release from our customers. Our customers may have the right under certain circumstances and with certain penalties or consequences to terminate,reduce or defer firm orders that we have in backlog. If our customers terminate, reduce or defer firm orders, we may be protected from certain costs and losses, but our sales will nevertheless be adversely affected. Although we strive to maintainongoing relationships with our customers, there is an ongoing risk that orders may be cancelled or rescheduled due to fluctuations in our customers business needs or purchasing budgets.    Also, our realization of sales from new and existing programs is inherentlysubject to a number of important risks and uncertainties, including whether our customers will execute the launch of product programs on time, or at all, the number of units that our customers will actually produce and the timing of production. Inaddition, until firm orders are placed, our customers generally have the right to discontinue a program or replace us with another supplier at any time without penalty. Our failure to realize sales from new and existing programs could have amaterial adverse effect on our net sales, results of operations and cash flows.    We may not recover all of our up-front costs related to new or existing programs. New programs require significant up-front investments and capital expenditures for engineering, design and tooling. As OEMs inthe transportation and aerospace industries have looked to suppliers to bear increasing responsibility for the design, engineering and manufacture of systems and components, they have increasingly shifted the financial risk associated with thoseresponsibilities to the suppliers as well. This trend is likely to continue and is most evident in the area of engineering cost reimbursement. Historically, these investments have been fully reimbursed by OEMs, but in the future there may be othermechanisms established by OEMs that could result in less than full reimbursement or no reimbursement. We cannot assure you that we will have adequate funds to make such up-front investments and capital expenditures. In the event that we are unableto make such investments and expenditures, or to recover them through sales or direct reimbursement of our engineering expenses from our customers, our profitability, liquidity and cash flows may be adversely affected. In addition, we incur costsand make capital expenditures for new program awards based upon certain estimates of production volumes. While we attempt to recover such costs and capital expenditures by appropriately pricing our products, the prices of our products are based inpart upon planned production volumes. If the actual production is significantly less than planned, we may be unable to recover such costs. In addition, because a significant portion of our overall costs is fixed, declines in our customersproduction levels can adversely affect the level of our reported results even if our up-front investments and capital expenditures are recovered.    We may not recover all of our up-front costs related to RSPs. Our total commitments in RSP participation fees as of December 31, 2008 equaled$293.7 million, all of which had been paid at such time. We participate in aftermarket RSPs under which we receive an exclusive right to supply designated aftermarket parts to a large aerospace manufacturer over the life of an aircraft engineprogram. As consideration, we pay participation fees, which are recorded as long-lived intangible assets and are recognized as a reduction to sales over the life of the program. The recoverability of the asset is dependent upon future revenuesrelated to the programs aftermarket parts. The potential exists that actual revenues will not meet expectations. A shortfall in   7 Table of Contentsfuture revenues may result in the failure to recover the total amount of the investments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results ofoperations and cash flows.    We face risks of cost overrunsand losses on fixed-price contracts. We sell certain of our products under firm, fixed-price contracts providing for a fixed price for the products regardless of the production or purchase costs incurred by us. The cost of producing products maybe adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, outside processing, overhead and other factors, including manufacturing inefficiencies. Increased production costs may result in cost overruns and losses on contracts.   The departure of existing management and key personnel, ashortage of skilled employees or a lack of qualified sales professionals could materially affect our business, operations and prospects. Our executive officers are important to the management and direction of our business. Our future successdepends, in large part, on our ability to retain these officers and other capable management personnel. Although we believe we will be able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should the need arise, our inability to doso could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Because of the complex nature of many of our products and services, we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilledworkforce. In addition, there are significant costs associated with the hiring and training of sales professionals. We could be adversely affected by a shortage of available skilled employees or the loss of a significant number of our salesprofessionals.    Any product liability claims in excess ofinsurance may adversely affect our financial condition. Our operations expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of our products and the products we buy from third parties and sell toour customers. For example, we may be exposed to potential liability for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of a spring or other part in a vehicle or an aircraft component designed, manufactured or sold by us, or the failure of anaircraft component that has been serviced by us or of the components, including potentially hazardous substances, in a product purchased by us and sold by us to one of our customers. While we believe that our liability insurance is adequate toprotect us from these liabilities, our insurance may not cover all liabilities. Additionally, insurance coverage may not be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us. Any material liability not covered by insurance or for which third-partyindemnification is not available could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted by strikes or work stoppages. Approximately 13%of our U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and 45% of our non-U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or statutory trade union agreements. In 2009 we will be negotiating collective bargainingagreements with unionized employees at our Burlington, Canada; Bristol, Connecticut; Corry, Pennsylvania; and Saline, Michigan facilities, representing approximately 300 employees for the National Healthcare and Pension Agreement. Although webelieve that our relations with our employees are good, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements, or that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor,including healthcare, pensions or other benefits. Any potential strikes or work stoppages, and the resulting adverse impact on our relationships with customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results ofoperations or cash flows. Similarly, a protracted strike or work stoppage at any of our major customers, suppliers or other vendors could materially adversely affect our business.    RISKS RELATED TO THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE    A general economic downturn could adversely affect our business and financial results. All of our businesses are impacted by thehealth of the economies in which they operate. A decline in economies in which we operate could reduce demand for our products and services or increase pricing pressures, thereby having an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, resultsof operations and cash flows. We derive a large portion of our sales from the transportation industry. Recently, that industry and, in particular, U.S. automakers have suffered from financial pressures which have had negative consequences forcompanies in, and companies with customers in, the transportation industry. The transportation industry has generally suffered from   8 Table of Contentsunfavorable pricing pressures in North America and other regions. The operation of our business within that industry subjects us to the pressures applicableto all companies operating in it. While the precise effects of such instability on the transportation industry are difficult to determine, they may negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.   We operate in very competitive markets. We may not be ableto compete effectively with our competitors, and competitive pressures could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our two global business segments compete with a number of larger and smaller companies inthe markets we serve. Some of our competitors have greater financial, production, research and development, or other resources than we do. Within the aerospace aftermarket business unit, certain of our OEM customers compete with our repair andoverhaul business. Some of our OEM customers in the aerospace industry also compete with us where they have the ability to manufacture the components and assemblies that we supply to them but have chosen, for capacity limitations, costconsiderations or other reasons, to outsource the manufacturing to us. Our two business segments compete on the basis of price, service, quality, reliability of supply, technology, innovation and design. The products sold by Logistics andManufacturing Services are not unique, and its competitors carry substantially similar products. We must continue to make investments to maintain and improve our competitive position. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources tocontinue to make such investments or that we will be successful in maintaining our competitive position. Our competitors may develop products or services, or methods of delivering those products or services, that are superior to our products,services or methods. Our competitors may also adapt more quickly than we to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. Pricing pressures could cause us to adjust the prices of certain of our products to stay competitive. We cannot assureyou that we will be able to compete successfully with our existing or future competitors. Also, if consolidation of our existing competitors occurs, we expect the competitive pressures we face to increase. Our failure to compete successfully couldadversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    Our customers businesses are generally cyclical. Weaknesses in the industries in which our customers operate could impact our revenues and profitability. The industries to which we sell tend to decline inresponse to overall declines in industrial production. The OEM aerospace unit of Precision Components and the aftermarket aerospace unit of Logistics and Manufacturing Services are heavily dependent on the commercial aerospace industry, which iscyclical. In addition, parts of Precision Components are dependent on the transportation industry, general industrial and tooling markets, all of which are also cyclical. Many of our customers have historically experienced periodic downturns, whichoften have had a negative effect on demand for our products.    Original equipment manufacturers in the transportation and aerospace industries have significant pricing leverage over suppliers and may be able to achieve price reductions over time. There is substantial and continuing pressure fromOEMs in the transportation, including automotive and aerospace, industries to reduce the prices they pay to suppliers. We attempt to manage such downward pricing pressure, while trying to preserve our business relationships with our customers, byseeking to reduce our production costs through various measures, including purchasing raw materials and components at lower prices and implementing cost-effective process improvements. Our suppliers have periodically resisted, and in the future mayresist, pressure to lower their prices and may seek to impose price increases. In the past, our efforts to convince our key transportation OEM customers to share in raw material price increases were met with limited success. If we are unable tooffset OEM price reductions through these measures, our profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, OEMs have substantial leverage in setting purchasing and payment terms, including the terms of accelerated paymentprograms under which payments are made prior to the account due date in return for an early payment discount. OEMs can unexpectedly change their purchasing policies or payment practices, which could have a negative impact on our short-term workingcapital.    Demand for our defense-related products depends ongovernment spending. A portion of the Precision Components aerospace units sales are derived from the military market. The military market is largely dependent upon government budgets and is subject to governmental appropriations. Althoughmulti-year   9 Table of Contentscontracts may be authorized in connection with major procurements, funds are generally appropriated on a fiscal year basis even though a program may beexpected to continue for several years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded and additional funds are committed only as further appropriations are made. We cannot assure you that an increase in defense spending will be allocated toprograms that would benefit our business. Moreover, we cannot assure you that new military aircraft programs in which we participate will enter full-scale production as expected. A decrease in levels of defense spending or the governmentstermination of, or failure to fully fund, one or more of the contracts for the programs in which we participate could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.    The consolidation occurring in the industries in which we operate couldadversely affect our business and financial results. The industries in which we operate have been experiencing consolidation. There has been consolidation of both suppliers and the customers we serve. Supplier consolidation is in partattributable to OEMs more frequently awarding long-term sole source or preferred supplier contracts to the most capable suppliers in an effort to reduce the total number of suppliers from whom components and systems are purchased. We cannot assureyou that our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows will not be adversely impacted as a result of consolidation by our competitors or customers.    The aerospace industry is highly regulated. Complications related to aerospace regulations may adversely affect theCompany. A substantial portion of our income is derived from our aerospace businesses. The aerospace industry is highly regulated in the United States by the Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, and in other countries by similar regulatoryagencies. We must be certified by these agencies and, in some cases, by individual OEMs in order to engineer and service systems and components used in specific aircraft models. If material authorizations or approvals were delayed, revoked orsuspended, our business could be adversely affected. New or more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted, or industry oversight heightened, in the future, and we may incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or anyheightened industry oversight.    Environmental regulationsimpose costs and regulatory requirements on our operations. Environmental compliance may be more costly than we expect, and we may be subject to material environmental-based claims in the future. Our past and present business operations and pastand present ownership and operations of real property and the use, sale, storage and handling of chemicals and hazardous products subject us to extensive and changing U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, as well as thoseof other countries, pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, enforcement, disposition of wastes (including hazardous wastes), the use, shipping, labeling, and storage of chemicals and hazardous materials, or otherwise relatingto protection of the environment. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations. In addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, thediscovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become subject to new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition, results of operations and cash flows.    We use andgenerate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations. In addition, many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we monitor hazardous waste management and applicable environmentalpermitting and reporting for compliance with applicable laws at our locations in the ordinary course of our business. We may be subject to potential material liabilities relating to any investigation and clean-up of our locations or properties wherewe delivered hazardous waste for handling or disposal that may be contaminated, and to claims alleging personal injury.    High fuel prices may impact our operating results. Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of operating expenses for companies in the aerospaceindustry. Widespread disruption to oil production, refinery operations and pipeline capacity in certain areas of the United States can increase the price of jet fuel significantly. Conflicts in the Middle East, an important source of oil for theU.S. and other countries where we do business, cause prices   10 Table of Contentsfor fuel to be volatile and often significantly higher than historic levels. Because many of our customers and we are in the aerospace industry, increasedfuel costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. The price of fuel generally impacts the cost of operating our manufacturing and distribution operations. Additionally, higher fuel costs mayincrease our freight expenses.    Products and services of themature industries in which we operate may be rendered obsolete by new products, technologies and processes. Our manufacturing operations focus on highly engineered components which require extensive engineering and research and development time.Our competitive advantage may be adversely impacted if we cannot continue to introduce new products ahead of our competition, or if our products are rendered obsolete by other products or by new, different technologies and processes.    RISKS RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS    We may not be able to effectively integrate acquired companies into ouroperations. We have completed 15 acquisitions since 1999. We seek acquisition opportunities that complement and expand our operations and that will help create stockholder value over the long term. We cannot assure you that we will be able toeffectively integrate our acquisitions into our operations. We may not be able to do so successfully without substantial costs, delays or other difficulties. We could face significant challenges in consolidating functions and integrating procedures,information technology systems, personnel, product lines and operations in a timely and efficient manner. We may encounter difficulties in training our sales forces to work with new products and customers.    The integration process is complex and time-consuming, may be disruptive toour businesses, and may cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our businesses as a result of a number of obstacles, such as: the loss of significant customers; the need to retrain skilled engineering, sales and other personnel resultingfrom the loss of key employees; the failure to maintain the quality of customer service that each business has historically provided; the need to coordinate geographically diverse organizations; retooling and reprogramming of equipment andinformation technology systems; and the resulting diversion of managements attention from our day-to-day business and the need to hire additional management personnel to address integration obstacles.    If we are not successful in integrating our acquisitions into our operations,if the integration takes longer than anticipated, if the companies or assets we acquire do not perform as we anticipate, or if the integrated product and service offerings fail to achieve market acceptance, our business, financial position, resultsof operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.    We may not be able to realize the anticipated cost savings, synergies or revenue enhancements from acquisitions, and we may incur significant costs to achieve these savings. Even if we are able to integrate successfully ouroperations and the operations of our acquisitions, we may not be able to realize the cost savings, synergies or revenue enhancements that we anticipate from these acquisitions, either as to amount or in the time frame that we expect. Our ability torealize anticipated cost savings, synergies and revenue enhancements may be affected by a number of factors, including the following: our ability to effectively eliminate duplicative back office overhead and overlapping sales personnel, rationalizemanufacturing capacity, synchronize information technology systems, consolidate warehousing and distribution facilities and shift production to more economical facilities; significant cash and non-cash integration and implementation costs or chargesin order to achieve those cost savings, which could offset any such savings and other synergies resulting from our acquisitions; and our ability to avoid labor disruption in connection with integration efforts. In addition, our growth to date hasplaced, and future acquisitions could continue to place, significant demand on our administrative, operational and financial resources.   11 Table of ContentsFuture acquisitions and strategic alliances are a key component of our anticipated growth. We may notbe able to identify or complete future acquisitions or strategic alliances. Turmoil in the equity and credit markets may limit our ability to undertake acquisitions. A significant portion of the industries that we serve are mature industries. Asa result, our growth has resulted in large part from, and our future growth may depend in part on, the successful acquisition and integration of businesses into our existing operations. While we are focused on adding strategic pieces to ouroperations by acquiring companies, manufacturing and service assets and technologies that complement our existing businesses, we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions, obtain financing for future acquisitionson satisfactory terms, obtain regulatory approval or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future. In addition, opportunities to enter into additional aftermarket RSPs or alliances may be limited. Aftermarket RSPs will have an impact on the rate offuture growth and profitability as a result of the business mix, the number of new RSPs entered into, the level of aftermarket volume, increasing management fees, the amortization of the participation fees, and the expiration of the SingaporePioneer tax incentives on these programs.   "
4,B,BARNES GROUP INC,2008-02-25,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
    Ourbusiness, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Please note that additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impact our business andoperations.   4 Table of ContentsRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS    We depend on revenues and earnings from a small number of significant customers. Any loss, cancellation, reduction ordelay in purchases by these customers could harm our business. In 2007, our net sales to General Electric and its subsidiaries accounted for 18% of our total sales and approximately 64% of Barnes Aerospaces net sales were to GeneralElectric. Approximately 20% of Barnes Industrials sales in 2007 were to its three largest customers. Some of our success will depend on our continued ability to develop and manage relationships with significant customers. We cannot assure youthat we will be able to retain our largest customers. Some of our customers may in the future shift their purchases from us to our competitors, in-house or to other sources. Our long-term sales agreements provide that until a firm order is placed bya customer for a particular product, the customer may unilaterally reduce or discontinue its projected purchases without penalty. The loss of one or more of our largest customers, any reduction or delay in sales to these customers, our inability tosuccessfully develop relationships with new customers, or future price concessions we make to retain customers could significantly reduce our sales and profitability.    Our ability to execute on capacity expansion and transfer-of-work initiatives may affect future revenues andprofitability. Effective capacity planning and execution and the transfer of work among facilities are key components for meeting customer demand. If we are unable to effectively meet capacity requirements or transfer work among facilities, itmay adversely impact our net sales, results of operations and cash flows.     The global nature of our business exposes us to foreign currency fluctuations that may affect our future revenues and profitability. We have manufacturing, sales and distribution facilities around the world,and the majority of our foreign operations use the local currency as their functional currency. These include, among others, the Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, Euro, Korean won, Mexican peso, Singapore dollar,Swedish krona, Swiss franc and Thai baht. Because our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies expose us to translation risk when the local currencyfinancial statements are translated to U.S. dollars. Changes in currency exchange rates may also expose us to transaction risk. We may buy protecting or offsetting positions or hedges in certain currencies to reduce our exposure to currency exchangefluctuations; however, these transactions may not be adequate or effective to protect us from the exposure for which they are purchased. We have not engaged in any speculative hedging activities. Currency fluctuations may impact our revenues andprofitability in the future.    Our operations depend on ourmanufacturing, distribution, sales and service facilities in various parts of the world which are subject to physical, financial, regulatory and other risks that could disrupt our operations. During 2007, approximately 40% of our sales were fromfacilities outside of the United States. Also, we have 12 manufacturing facilities and 23 distribution/sales centers outside the United States and Canada. The international scope of our business subjects us to risks such as threats of war, terrorismor instability of governments and legal systems in countries in which we or our customers conduct business. In addition, because we depend upon our information systems to help process orders, to manage inventory and accounts receivable collections,to purchase, sell and ship products efficiently and on a timely basis, to maintain cost-effective operations, and to help provide superior service to our customers, any disruption in the operation of our information systems, including widespreadpower outages, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Some of our facilities are located in areas that may be affected by natural disasters, including earthquakes or tsunamis,which could cause significant damage and disruption to the operations of those facilities and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, some of ourmanufacturing equipment and tooling is custom-made and is not readily replaceable. Loss of such equipment or tooling could have a negative impact on our manufacturing business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.   Although we have obtained property damage and business interruptioninsurance, a major catastrophe such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood or other natural disaster at any of our sites, or significant labor strikes, work   5 Table of Contentsstoppages, political unrest, or any of the events described above, some of which may not be covered by our insurance, in any of the areas where we conductoperations could result in a prolonged interruption of our business. Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in the manufacture or shipment of products or the provision of repair and other services that may resultin our loss of sales and customers. Our insurance will not cover all potential risks, and we cannot assure you that we will have adequate insurance to compensate us for all losses that result from any insured risks. Any material loss not covered byinsurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We cannot assure you that insurance will be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us or at a cost that will not have amaterial adverse effect on our profitability, net income and cash flows.    Our significant international operations and assets subject us to additional financial and regulatory risks. We have operations and assets in various parts of the world. In addition, we sell our products andservices in foreign countries and seek to increase our level of international business activity. Accordingly, we are subject to various risks, including: U.S.-imposed embargoes of sales to specific countries; foreign import controls (which may bearbitrarily imposed or enforced); import regulations and duties; export regulations (which require us to comply with stringent licensing regimes); anti-dumping regulations; price and currency controls; exchange rate fluctuations; dividend remittancerestrictions; expropriation of assets; war, civil uprisings and riots; government instability; the necessity of obtaining governmental approval for new and continuing products and operations; legal systems or decrees, laws, taxes, regulations,interpretations and court decisions that are not always fully developed and that may be retroactively or arbitrarily applied; and difficulties in managing a global enterprise. We have experienced inadvertent violations of some of these regulations,including export regulations and regulations prohibiting air transport of aerosol products, in the past, none of which has had or, we believe, will have a material adverse effect on our business. However, any significant violations of theseregulations in the future could result in civil or criminal sanctions, and the loss of export or other licenses which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may also be subject to unanticipated income taxes, excise duties, importtaxes, export taxes or other governmental assessments. In addition, our organizational structure may limit our ability to transfer funds between countries, particularly into and out of the United States, without incurring adverse tax consequences.Any of these events could result in a loss of business or other unexpected costs that could reduce sales or profits and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    Our ability to recover our significant deferred tax assets related to taxoperating loss carryforwards depends on future income. We have significant deferred tax assets related to operating loss carryforwards. The realization of these assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income during theoperating loss carryforward period. Failure to realize this tax benefit could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditions and results of operations.    Changes in the availability or price of materials and energy resources could adversely affect our costs andprofitability. We may be adversely affected by the availability or price of raw materials and energy resources, particularly related to certain manufacturing operations that utilize high-grade steel spring wire and titanium. The availability andprice of raw materials and energy resources may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, new laws or regulations, global economic or political events including strikes, terrorist attacks and war, suppliers allocations toother purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. In some instances there are limited sources for raw materials and a limited number of primary suppliers for some of our products forresale. Although we are not dependent upon any single source for any of our principal raw materials or products for resale, and such materials and products have, historically, been readily available, we cannot assure you that such raw materials andproducts will continue to be readily available. Disruption in the supply of raw materials, products or energy resources or our inability to come to favorable agreements with our suppliers could impair our ability to manufacture, sell and deliver ourproducts and require us to pay higher prices. Any increase in prices for such raw materials, products or energy resources could materially adversely affect our costs and our profitability.   6 Table of ContentsWe maintain pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the U.S. and certain internationallocations. Declines in the stock market, prevailing interest rates and rising medical costs may cause an increase in our pension and other postretirement benefit expenses in the future and result in reductions in our pension fund asset valuesand increases in our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. These changes have caused and may continue to cause a significant reduction in our net worth and may require us to make higher cash contributions to our pension andpostretirement plans in the future.    We have significantindebtedness that could affect our operations and financial condition. At December 31, 2007, we had consolidated debt and capitalized lease obligations of $434.5 million, representing approximately 40% of our total capital (indebtednessplus stockholders equity) as of that date. We may incur additional indebtedness to finance future acquisitions. Our level of indebtedness and the significant debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effectson our operations and financial condition and may adversely affect the value or trading price of our outstanding equity securities and debt securities. For example, our indebtedness could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cashflows from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, investments in technology and research and development, acquisitions, dividends and other generalcorporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industries in which we compete; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors, some of whom have lower debt service obligations andgreater financial resources than we do; limit our ability to borrow additional funds; or increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions.    Our failure to meet certain financial covenants required by our debt agreements may materially and adversely affect our assets,financial position and cash flows. Certain of our debt arrangements require us to maintain certain interest coverage and leverage ratios and a minimum net worth and limit our ability to incur debt, make investments or undertake certain otherbusiness activities. These requirements could limit our ability to obtain future financing and may prevent us from taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. Our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our debtarrangements may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the restrictions could result in an event ofdefault under our debt arrangements which, in turn, could result in an event of default under the terms of our other indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our debt arrangements, after the expiration of any grace periods, ourlenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our debt arrangements, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to happen, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in fullthe payments due under those arrangements or our other indebtedness.    We have significant goodwill and an impairment of our goodwill could cause a decline in our net worth. Our total assets include substantial goodwill. At December 31, 2007, our goodwill totaled $380.5 million. The goodwillresults from our acquisitions, representing the excess of the purchase price we paid over the net assets of the companies acquired. We assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill during each calendar year or sooner iftriggering events warrant. If future operating performance at one or more of our businesses does not meet expectations, we may be required to reflect, under currently applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating results for goodwillimpairment. The recognition of an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material. A reduction in our stockholders equity due toan impairment of goodwill may affect our ability to maintain the required net worth ratios under our debt arrangements.    We could be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. Our profitability may be adversely affected as a result of increases in interestrates. At December 31, 2007, we and our subsidiaries had approximately $434.5 million aggregate principal amount of consolidated debt and capitalized lease obligations outstanding, of which approximately 38% had interest rates that float withthe market. A 100 basis point increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in effect at December 31, 2007 would have resulted in an approximate $1.6 million annualized increase in interest expense.   7 Table of ContentsWe may not realize all of the sales expected from our existing Barnes Aerospace and Barnes Industrialbacklog or anticipated orders. At December 31, 2007, Barnes Aerospace had $473 million of order backlog and Barnes Industrial had $107 million of order backlog. There can be no assurances that the revenues projected in our backlog will berealized or, if realized, will result in profits. We consider backlog to be firm customer orders for future delivery. From time to time, OEM customers of Barnes Aerospace and Barnes Industrial provide projections of components and assemblies thatthey anticipate purchasing in the future under new and existing programs. Such projections are not included in our backlog unless we have received a firm release from our customers. Our customers may have the right under certain circumstances andwith certain penalties or consequences to terminate, reduce or defer firm orders that we have in backlog. If our customers terminate, reduce or defer firm orders, we may be protected from certain costs and losses, but our sales will nevertheless beadversely affected. Although we strive to maintain ongoing relationships with our customers, there is an ongoing risk that orders may be cancelled or rescheduled due to fluctuations in our customers business needs or purchasing budgets.   Also, our realization of sales from new and existing programsis inherently subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties, including whether our customers will execute the launch of product programs on time, or at all, the number of units that our customers will actually produce and the timing ofproduction. In addition, until firm orders are placed, our customers generally have the right to discontinue a program or replace us with another supplier at any time without penalty. Our failure to realize sales from new and existing programs couldhave a material adverse effect on our net sales, results of operations and cash flows.    We may not recover all of our up-front costs related to new or existing programs. New programs require significant up-front investments and capital expenditures for engineering, design and tooling. As OEMs inthe transportation and aerospace industries have looked to suppliers to bear increasing responsibility for the design, engineering and manufacture of systems and components, they have increasingly shifted the financial risk associated with thoseresponsibilities to the suppliers as well. This trend is likely to continue and is most evident in the area of engineering cost reimbursement. Historically, these investments have been fully reimbursed by OEMs, but in the future there may be othermechanisms established by OEMs that could result in less than full reimbursement or no reimbursement. We cannot assure you that we will have adequate funds to make such up-front investments and capital expenditures. In the event that we are unableto make such investments and expenditures, or to recover them through sales or direct reimbursement of our engineering expenses from our customers, our profitability, liquidity and cash flows may be adversely affected. In addition, we incur costsand make capital expenditures for new program awards based upon certain estimates of production volumes. While we attempt to recover such costs and capital expenditures by appropriately pricing our products, the prices of our products are based inpart upon planned production volumes. If the actual production is significantly less than planned, we may be unable to recover such costs. In addition, because a significant portion of our overall costs is fixed, declines in our customersproduction levels can adversely affect the level of our reported results even if our up-front investments and capital expenditures are recovered.    We may not recover all of our up-front costs related to RSPs. Our total commitments in RSP participation fees as of December 31, 2007 equaled$293.7 million, of which $236.2 million had been paid at such time. We participate in aftermarket RSPs under which we receive an exclusive right to supply designated aftermarket parts to a large aerospace manufacturer over the life of an aircraftengine program. As consideration, we pay participation fees, which are recorded as long-lived intangible assets and are recognized as a reduction to sales over the life of the program. The recoverability of the asset is dependent upon futurerevenues related to the programs aftermarket parts. The potential exists that actual revenues will not meet expectations. A shortfall in future revenues may result in the failure to recover the total amount of the investments, which couldadversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.    We face risks of cost overruns and losses on fixed-price contracts. We sell certain of our products under firm, fixed-price contracts providing for a fixed price for the products regardless of the production orpurchase costs incurred by us. The cost of producing products may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor,   8 Table of Contentsmaterials, fuel, outside processing, overhead and other factors, including manufacturing inefficiencies. Increased production costs may result in costoverruns and losses on contracts.    The departure of existingmanagement and key personnel, a shortage of skilled employees or a lack of qualified sales professionals could materially affect our business, operations and prospects. Our executive officers are important to the management and direction of ourbusiness. Our future success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain these officers and other capable management personnel. Although we believe we will be able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should theneed arise, our inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Because of the complex nature of many of our products and services, we are generally dependent on aneducated and highly skilled workforce. In addition, there are significant costs associated with the hiring and training of sales professionals. We could be adversely affected by a shortage of available skilled employees or the loss of a significantnumber of our sales professionals.    Any product liabilityclaims in excess of insurance may adversely affect our financial condition. Our operations expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of our products and the products we buy from thirdparties and sell to our customers. For example, we may be exposed to potential liability for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of a spring or other part in a vehicle or an aircraft component designed, manufactured or sold by us, orthe failure of an aircraft component that has been serviced by us or of the components, including potentially hazardous substances, in a product purchased by us and sold by us to one of our customers. While we believe that our liability insurance isadequate to protect us from these liabilities, our insurance may not cover all liabilities. Additionally, insurance coverage may not be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us. Any material liability not covered by insurance or for whichthird-party indemnification is not available could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted by strikes or work stoppages. Approximately 12%of our U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and 39% of our non-U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or statutory trade union agreements. In 2008 we will be negotiating collective bargainingagreements with unionized employees at our Corry, Pennsylvania facility, representing 168 employees, and at our Elizabethtown, Kentucky facility, representing 30 employees. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are good, wecannot assure you that we will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements, or that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor, including healthcare, pensions or other benefits. Anypotential strikes or work stoppages, and the resulting adverse impact on our relationships with customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Similarly, a protracted strikeor work stoppage at any of our major customers, suppliers or other vendors could materially adversely affect our business.    RISKS RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS    We may not be able to effectively integrate acquired companies into our operations. We have completed 15 acquisitions since 1999. We seekacquisition opportunities that complement and expand our operations and that will help create stockholder value over the long term. We cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively integrate our recent or future acquisitions into ouroperations. We may not be able to do so successfully without substantial costs, delays or other difficulties. We could face significant challenges in consolidating functions and integrating procedures, information technology systems, personnel,product lines and operations in a timely and efficient manner. We may encounter difficulties in training our sales forces to work with new products and customers.    The integration process is complex and time-consuming, may be disruptive to our businesses, and may cause an interruptionof, or a loss of momentum in, our businesses as a result of a number of obstacles, such as: the loss of significant customers; the need to retrain skilled engineering, sales and other personnel resulting from   9 Table of Contentsthe loss of key employees; the failure to maintain the quality of customer service that each business has historically provided; the need to coordinategeographically diverse organizations; retooling and reprogramming of equipment and information technology systems; and the resulting diversion of managements attention from our day-to-day business and the need to hire additional managementpersonnel to address integration obstacles.    If we are notsuccessful in integrating our recent and future acquisitions into our operations, if the integration takes longer than anticipated, if the companies or assets we acquire do not perform as we anticipate, or if the integrated product and serviceofferings fail to achieve market acceptance, our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.    We may not be able to realize the anticipated cost savings, synergies or revenue enhancements from acquisitions, and we may incur significant costs toachieve these savings. Even if we are able to integrate successfully our operations and the operations of our recent and any future acquisitions, we may not be able to realize the cost savings, synergies or revenue enhancements that weanticipate from these acquisitions, either as to amount or in the time frame that we expect. Our ability to realize anticipated cost savings, synergies and revenue enhancements may be affected by a number of factors, including the following: ourability to effectively eliminate duplicative back office overhead and overlapping sales personnel, rationalize manufacturing capacity, synchronize information technology systems, consolidate warehousing and distribution facilities and shiftproduction to more economical facilities; our incurrence of significant cash and non-cash integration and implementation costs or charges in order to achieve those cost savings, which could offset any such savings and other synergies resulting fromour recent or future acquisitions; and our ability to avoid labor disruption in connection with integration efforts. In addition, our growth to date has placed, and future acquisitions could continue to place, significant demand on ouradministrative, operational and financial resources.    Futureacquisitions and strategic alliances are a key component of our anticipated growth. We may not be able to identify or complete future acquisitions or strategic alliances. A significant portion of the industries that we serve are matureindustries. As a result, our recent growth has resulted in large part from, and our future growth will depend in part on, the successful acquisition and integration of businesses into our existing operations. While we are focused on adding strategicpieces to our operations by acquiring companies, manufacturing and service assets and technologies that complement our existing businesses, we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions, obtain financing for futureacquisitions on satisfactory terms, obtain regulatory approval or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future. In addition, opportunities to enter into additional aftermarket RSPs or alliances may be limited. Aftermarket RSPs will have an impacton the rate of future growth and profitability as a result of the business mix between aftermarket and manufacturing, the number of new RSPs entered into, the level of aftermarket volume, increasing management fees, the amortization of theparticipation fees, and the expiration of the Singapore Pioneer tax incentives on these programs.    RISKS RELATED TO THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE    A general economic downturn could adversely affect our business and financial results. All of our businesses, and in particular Barnes Distribution, are impacted by the health of the economies in which theyoperate. A decline in economies in which we operate could reduce demand for our products and services or increase pricing pressures, thereby having an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.   A downturn in the transportation industry could adverselyaffect our business and financial results. We derive a large portion of our sales from the transportation industry. Recently, that industry has suffered from certain financial pressures which have had negative consequences for companies in, andcompanies with customers in, the transportation industry. The transportation industry has generally suffered from unfavorable pricing pressures in North America and may do so in other regions. The operation of our business within that industrysubjects us to the pressures applicable to all companies operating in it. While the precise effects of such instability on the transportation industry are difficult to determine, they may negatively impact our business, financial condition, resultsof operations and cash flows.   10 Table of ContentsWe operate in very competitive markets. We may not be able to compete effectively with ourcompetitors, and competitive pressures could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our three business segments compete with a number of larger and smaller companies in the markets we serve. Some of ourcompetitors have greater financial, production, research and development, or other resources than we do. Within Barnes Aerospace, certain of our OEM customers compete with our repair and overhaul business. Some of our OEM customers in the aerospaceindustry also compete with us where they have the ability to manufacture the components and assemblies that we supply to them but have chosen, for capacity limitations, cost considerations or other reasons, to outsource the manufacturing to us. Ourthree businesses compete on the basis of price, service, quality, reliability of supply, technology, innovation and, in the case of Barnes Aerospace and Barnes Industrial, design. The products sold by Barnes Distribution are not unique, and itscompetitors carry substantially similar products. We must continue to make investments to maintain and improve our competitive position. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or that we willbe successful in maintaining our competitive position. Our competitors may develop products or services, or methods of delivering those products or services, that are superior to our products, services or methods. Our competitors may also adapt morequickly than we to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. Pricing pressures could cause us to adjust the prices of certain of our products to stay competitive. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with ourexisting or future competitors. Also, if consolidation of our existing competitors occurs, we expect the competitive pressures we face to increase. Our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our business, financial condition, resultsof operations and cash flows.    Our customersbusinesses are generally cyclical. Weaknesses in the industries in which our customers operate could impact our revenues and profitability. The industries to which we sell tend to decline in response to overall declines in industrial production.Barnes Aerospace is heavily dependent on the commercial aerospace industry, which is cyclical. Barnes Industrial is dependent on the transportation industry, general industrial and tooling markets, all of which are also cyclical. In addition, manyof our customers have historically experienced periodic downturns, which often have had a negative effect on demand for our products. For example, lower production rates in the transportation markets and reduced overall sales of telecommunicationsand electronics products adversely affect the volume and price of orders placed for products used to manufacture these products, including our springs. Prior industry downturns have negatively affected our net sales, operating income, net income andcash flows. For example, there was a downturn in the aerospace industry in the beginning of this decade which resulted in a sharp decrease globally in new commercial aircraft deliveries, order cancellations or deferrals by the major airlines andreduced demand for our aerospace components and overhaul and repair services. While there has been a recovery in commercial air traffic, any future downturn could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cashflows.    Original equipment manufacturers in thetransportation and aerospace industries have significant pricing leverage over suppliers and may be able to achieve price reductions over time. There is substantial and continuing pressure from OEMs in the transportation, including automotiveand aerospace, industries to reduce the prices they pay to suppliers. We attempt to manage such downward pricing pressure, while trying to preserve our business relationships with our customers, by seeking to reduce our production costs throughvarious measures, including purchasing raw materials and components at lower prices and implementing cost-effective process improvements. Our suppliers have periodically resisted, and in the future may resist, pressure to lower their prices and mayseek to impose price increases. In the past, our efforts to convince our key transportation OEM customers to share in raw material price increases were met with limited success. If we are unable to offset OEM price reductions through these measures,our profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, OEMs have substantial leverage in setting purchasing and payment terms, including the terms of accelerated payment programs under which payments are made prior to the accountdue date in return for an early payment discount. OEMs can unexpectedly change their purchasing policies or payment practices, which could have a negative impact on our short-term working capital.   11 Table of ContentsDemand for our defense-related products depends on government spending. A portion of BarnesAerospaces sales are derived from the military market. The military market is largely dependent upon government budgets and is subject to governmental appropriations. Although multi-year contracts may be authorized in connection with majorprocurements, funds are generally appropriated on a fiscal year basis even though a program may be expected to continue for several years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded and additional funds are committed only as furtherappropriations are made. We cannot assure you that an increase in defense spending will be allocated to programs that would benefit our business. Moreover, we cannot assure you that new military aircraft programs in which we participate will enterfull-scale production as expected. A decrease in levels of defense spending or the governments termination of, or failure to fully fund, one or more of the contracts for the programs in which we participate could have a material adverse effecton our financial position and results of operations.    Theconsolidation occurring in the industries in which we operate could adversely affect our business and financial results. The industries in which we operate have been experiencing consolidation, particularly in the aerospace industry. There hasbeen consolidation of both suppliers, including us and our competitors, and the customers we serve. Supplier consolidation is in part attributable to OEMs more frequently awarding long-term sole source or preferred supplier contracts to the mostcapable suppliers in an effort to reduce the total number of suppliers from whom components and systems are purchased. We cannot assure you that our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows will not be adversely impacted asa result of consolidation by our competitors or customers.    The aerospace industry is highly regulated. Complications related to aerospace regulations may adversely affect Barnes Aerospace. A substantial portion of our income is derived from our aerospace business. The aerospace industry ishighly regulated in the United States by the Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, and in other countries by similar regulatory agencies. We must be certified by these agencies and, in some cases, by individual OEMs in order to engineer andservice systems and components used in specific aircraft models. If material authorizations or approvals were delayed, revoked or suspended, Barnes Aerospace would be adversely affected. New or more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted,or industry oversight heightened, in the future, and we may incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or any heightened industry oversight.   Environmental regulations impose costs and regulatory requirements on our operations. Environmental compliance may be more costly than we expect,and we may be subject to material environmental-based claims in the future. Our past and present business operations and past and present ownership and operations of real property and the use, sale, storage and handling of chemicals andhazardous products subject us to extensive and changing U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, as well as those of other countries, pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, enforcement, disposition ofwastes (including hazardous wastes), the use, shipping, labeling, and storage of chemicals and hazardous materials, or otherwise relating to protection of the environment. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, costs to complywith environmental laws and regulations. In addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require usto incur costs or become subject to new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    We use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations. In addition, many of our current and formerproperties are or have been used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we monitor hazardous waste management and applicable environmental permitting and reporting for compliance with applicable laws at our locations in the ordinary course of ourbusiness. We may be subject to potential material liabilities relating to any investigation and clean-up of our locations or properties where we delivered hazardous waste for handling or disposal that may be contaminated, and to claims allegingpersonal injury.   12 Table of ContentsHigh fuel prices may impact our operating results. Fuel costs constitute a significant portion ofoperating expenses for companies in the aerospace industry. Widespread disruption to oil production, refinery operations and pipeline capacity in certain areas of the United States can increase the price of jet fuel significantly. Conflicts in theMiddle East, an important source of oil for the U.S. and other countries where we do business, cause prices for fuel to be volatile and often significantly higher than historic levels. Because many of our customers and we are in the aerospaceindustry, increased fuel costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. The price of fuel generally impacts the cost of operating our manufacturing and distribution operations. Additionally, higherfuel costs may increase our freight expenses.    Products andservices of the mature industries in which we operate may be rendered obsolete by new products, technologies and processes. Our manufacturing operations focus on highly engineered components which require extensive engineering and research anddevelopment time. Our competitive advantage may be adversely impacted if we cannot continue to introduce new products ahead of our competition, or if our products are rendered obsolete by other products or by new, different technologies andprocesses.   "
17,B,BARNES GROUP INC,2007-02-26,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
    Ourbusiness, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Please note that additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impact our business andoperations.    RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS    We depend on revenues and earnings from a small number of significantcustomers. Any loss, cancellation, reduction or delay in purchases by these customers could harm our business. In each of 2006 and 2005, our net sales to General Electric and its subsidiaries accounted for 14% of our total sales for each ofthose years. Approximately 21% of Associated Springs sales in 2006 were from Associated Springs three largest customers, and approximately 61% of Barnes Aerospaces sales in 2006 were from General Electric. Some of our success willdepend on our continued ability to develop and manage relationships with significant customers. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our largest customers. Some of our customers may in the future shift their purchases from us to ourcompetitors, in-house or to other sources. Our sales agreements provide that until a firm order is placed by a customer for a particular product, the customer may unilaterally reduce or discontinue its projected purchases without penalty. The lossof one or more of our largest customers, any reduction or delay in sales to these customers, our inability to successfully develop relationships with new customers, or future price concessions we make to retain customers could significantly reduceour sales and profitability.    Our ability to execute oncapacity expansion and transfer of work initiatives may affect future revenues and profitability. Effective capacity planning and execution and the transfer of work among facilities are key components for meeting customer demand. If we areunable to effectively meet capacity requirements or transfer work among facilities it may adversely impact our net sales, results of operations and cash flows.     The global nature of our business exposes us to foreign currency fluctuations that may affect our future revenues andprofitability. We have manufacturing, sales and distribution facilities around the world, and the majority of our foreign operations use the local currency as their functional currency. These include, among others, the Canadian dollar, Euro,British pound, Singapore dollar, Swedish krona, Mexican peso and Brazilian real. Because our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies expose us totranslation risk when the local currency financial statements are translated to U.S. dollars, our functional currency. Changes in currency exchange rates may also expose us to transaction risk. We may buy protecting or offsetting positions or hedgesin certain currencies to reduce our exposure to currency exchange fluctuations; however, these transactions may not be adequate or effective to protect us from the exposure for which they are purchased. We have not engaged in any speculative hedgingactivities. Currency fluctuations may impact our revenues and profitability in the future.    Our operations depend on our manufacturing, distribution, sales and service facilities in various parts of the world which are subject to physical, financial, regulatory and other risks that could disrupt ouroperations. During 2006, approximately 34% of our sales were from facilities outside of the United States. Also, we have twelve manufacturing facilities and twenty distribution centers outside the United States and Canada. The internationalscope of our business subjects us to risks such as threats of war, terrorism or instability of governments and legal systems in countries in which we or our customers conduct business. In addition, because   5 Table of Contentswe depend upon our information systems to help process orders, to manage inventory and accounts receivables collections, to purchase, sell and ship productsefficiently and on a timely basis, to maintain cost-effective operations, and to help provide superior service to our customers, any disruption in the operation of our information systems, including widespread power outages, could have a materialadverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Some of our facilities are located in areas that may be affected by natural disasters, including earthquakes or tsunamis, which could cause significant damageand disruption to the operations of those facilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, some of our manufacturing equipment and tooling is custom madeand is not readily replaceable. Loss of such equipment or tooling could have a negative impact on our manufacturing business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    Although we have obtained property damage and business interruption insurance, a major catastrophe such as an earthquake,hurricane, flood or other natural disaster at any of our sites, or significant labor strikes, work stoppages, political unrest, or any of the events described above, some of which may not be covered by our insurance, in any of the areas where weconduct operations could result in a prolonged interruption of our business. Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in the manufacture or shipment of products or the provision of repair and other services that mayresult in our loss of sales and customers. Our insurance will not cover all potential risks, and we cannot assure you that we will have adequate insurance to compensate us for all losses that result from any insured risks. Any material loss notcovered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We cannot assure you that insurance will be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us or at a cost that will nothave a material adverse effect on our gross margins, net income and cash flows.    Our significant international operations and assets subject us to additional financial and regulatory risks. We have operations and assets in various parts of the world. In addition, we sell our products andservices in foreign countries and seek to increase our level of international business activity. Accordingly, we are subject to various risks, including: U.S.-imposed embargoes of sales to specific countries; foreign import controls (which may bearbitrarily imposed or enforced); import regulations and duties; export regulations (which require us to comply with stringent licensing regimes); anti-dumping regulations; price and currency controls; exchange rate fluctuations; dividend remittancerestrictions; expropriation of assets; war, civil uprisings and riots; government instability; the necessity of obtaining governmental approval for new and continuing products and operations; legal systems or decrees, laws, taxes, regulations,interpretations and court decisions that are not always fully developed and that may be retroactively or arbitrarily applied; and difficulties in managing a global enterprise. We have experienced inadvertent violations of some of these regulations,including export regulations and regulations prohibiting air transport of aerosol products, in the past, none of which have had or, we believe, will have a material adverse effect on our business. However, any significant violations of theseregulations in the future could result in civil or criminal sanctions, the loss of export or other licenses which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may also be subject to unanticipated income taxes, excise duties, importtaxes, export taxes or other governmental assessments. In addition, our organizational structure may limit our ability to transfer funds between countries, particularly into and out of the United States, without incurring adverse tax consequences.Any of these events could result in a loss of business or other unexpected costs that could reduce sales or profits and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    Changes in the availability or price of materials and energy resourcescould adversely affect our costs and profitability. We may be adversely affected by the availability or price of raw materials and energy resources, particularly related to certain manufacturing operations that utilize high-grade steel springwire and titanium. The availability and price of raw materials and energy resources may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, new laws or regulations, global economic or political events including strikes, terrorist attacksand war, suppliers allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. In some instances there are limited sources for raw materials and a limited number of primarysuppliers for some of our products for resale. Although we are not   6 Table of Contentsdependent upon any single source for any of our principal raw materials or products for resale, and such materials and products have, historically, beenreadily available, we cannot assure you that such raw materials and products will continue to be readily available. Disruption in the supply of raw materials, products or energy resources or our inability to come to favorable agreements with oursuppliers could impair our ability to manufacture, sell and deliver our products and require us to pay higher prices. Any increase in prices for such raw materials, products or energy resources could materially affect our costs and ourprofitability.    We maintain pension and other postretirementbenefit plans in the U.S. and certain international locations. Declines in the stock market, prevailing interest rates and rising medical costs may cause an increase in our pension and other postretirement benefit expenses in the future andresult in reductions in our pension fund asset values and increases in our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. These changes have caused and may continue to cause a significant reduction in our net worth and may require us to makehigher cash contributions to our pension and postretirement plans in the future.    We have significant indebtedness that could affect our operations and financial condition. At December 31, 2006, we had consolidated debt and capitalized lease obligations of $427.1 million, representingapproximately 45% of our total capital (indebtedness plus stockholders equity) as of that date. We may incur additional indebtedness to finance future acquisitions. Our level of indebtedness and the significant debt servicing costs associatedwith that indebtedness could have important effects on our operations and financial condition and may adversely affect the value or trading price of our outstanding equity securities and debt securities. For example, our indebtedness could requireus to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends and other general corporatepurposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industries in which we compete; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors, some of whom have lower debt service obligations and greaterfinancial resources than we do; limit our ability to borrow additional funds; or increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions.   Our failure to meet certain financial covenants required by our debt agreements may materially and adversely affect our assets, financial positionand cash flows. Certain of our debt arrangements require us to maintain certain interest coverage and leverage ratios and a minimum net worth and limit our ability to incur debt, make investments or undertake certain other business activities.These requirements could limit our ability to obtain future financing and may prevent us from taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. Our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our debt arrangements may be affectedby events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the restrictions could result in an event of default under our debtarrangements, which in turn could result in an event of default under the terms of our other indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our debt arrangements, after the expiration of any grace periods, our lenders could elect todeclare all amounts outstanding under our debt arrangements, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this happens, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the payments due under thosearrangements or our other indebtedness.    We have significantgoodwill and an impairment of our goodwill could cause a decline in our net worth. Our total assets include substantial goodwill. At December 31, 2006, our goodwill totaled $358.6 million. The goodwill results from our acquisitions,representing the excess of the purchase price we paid over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets we acquired. We assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill during each calendar year or sooner iftriggering events warrant. If future operating performance at one or more of our businesses does not meet expectations, we may be required to reflect, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating results for goodwillimpairment. The recognition of an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material. A reduction in our stockholders equity due toan impairment of goodwill may affect our ability to maintain the required net worth ratios under our debt arrangements.   7 Table of ContentsWe could be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. Our profitability may be adverselyaffected as a result of increases in interest rates. At December 31, 2006, we and our subsidiaries had approximately $427.1 million aggregate principal amount of consolidated debt and capitalized lease obligations outstanding, of whichapproximately 50% had interest rates that float with the market, either under the terms of the indebtedness or as a result of interest rate swap agreements that were then in force. A 100 basis point increase in the interest rate on the floating ratedebt in effect at December 31, 2006 would have resulted in an approximate $2.2 million annualized increase in interest expense.    We may not realize all of the sales expected from our existing Associated Spring and Barnes Aerospace backlog or anticipated orders. AtDecember 31, 2006, Associated Spring had $93.2 million of order backlog and Barnes Aerospace had $403.0 million of order backlog. There can be no assurances that the revenues projected in our backlog will be realized or, if realized, willresult in profits. We consider backlog to be firm customer orders for future delivery. From time to time, OEM customers of Associated Spring and Barnes Aerospace provide projections of components and assemblies that they anticipate purchasing in thefuture under new and existing programs. Such projections are not included in our backlog unless we have received a firm release from our customers. Our customers may have the right under certain circumstances and with certain penalties orconsequences to terminate, reduce or defer firm orders that we have in backlog. If our customers terminate, reduce or defer firm orders, we may be protected from certain costs and losses, but our sales will nevertheless be adversely affected.Although we strive to maintain ongoing relationships with our customers, there is an ongoing risk that orders may be cancelled or rescheduled due to fluctuations in our customers business needs or purchasing budgets.    Also, our realization of sales from new and existing programs is inherentlysubject to a number of important risks and uncertainties, including whether our customers will execute the launch of product programs on time, or at all, the number of units that our customers will actually produce and the timing of production. Inaddition, until firm orders are placed, our customers generally have the right to discontinue a program or replace us with another supplier at any time without penalty. Our failure to realize sales from new and existing programs could have amaterial adverse effect on our net sales, results of operations and cash flows.    We may not recover all of our up-front costs related to new or existing programs. New programs require significant up-front investments and capital expenditures for engineering, design and tooling. As OEMs inthe transportation and aerospace industries have looked to suppliers to bear increasing responsibility for the design, engineering and manufacture of systems and components, they have increasingly shifted the financial risk associated with thoseresponsibilities to the suppliers as well. This trend is likely to continue and is most evident in the area of engineering cost reimbursement. Historically, these investments have been fully reimbursed by OEMs, but in the future there may be othermechanisms established by OEMs that could result in less than full reimbursement or no reimbursement. We cannot assure you that we will have adequate funds to make such up-front investments and capital expenditures. In the event that we are unableto make such investments and expenditures, or to recover them through sales or direct reimbursement of our engineering expenses from our customers, our profitability, liquidity and cash flows may be adversely affected. In addition, we incur costsand make capital expenditures for new program awards based upon certain estimates of production volumes. While we attempt to recover such costs and capital expenditures by appropriately pricing our products, the prices of our products are based inpart upon planned production volumes. If the actual production is significantly less than planned, we may be unable to recover such costs. In addition, because a significant portion of our overall costs is fixed, declines in our customersproduction levels can adversely affect the level of our reported results even if our up-front investments and capital expenditures are recovered.    We may not recover all of our up-front costs related to RSPs. Our total commitments in RSP participation fees as of December 31, 2006 equaled$190.2 million, of which $163.1 million had been paid at such time. We participate in aftermarket RSPs under which we receive an exclusive right to supply designated aftermarket parts to a large aerospace manufacturer over the life of an aircraftengine program. As consideration, we pay participation fees, which are recorded as long-lived intangible assets, and are recognized as a reduction to   8 Table of Contentssales over the life of the program. The recoverability of the asset is dependent upon future revenues related to the programs aftermarket parts. Thepotential exists that actual revenues will not meet expectations. A shortfall in future revenues may result in the failure to recover the total amount of the investments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operationsand cash flows.    We face risks of cost overruns and losseson fixed-price contracts. We sell certain of our products under firm, fixed-price contracts providing for a fixed price for the products regardless of the production or purchase costs incurred by us. The cost of producing products may beadversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, outside processing, overhead and other factors, including manufacturing inefficiencies. Increased production costs may result in cost overruns and losses on contracts.   The departure of existing management and key personnel, ashortage of skilled employees or a lack of qualified sales professionals could materially affect our business, operations and prospects. Our executive officers are important to the management and direction of our business. Our future successdepends, in large part, on our ability to retain these officers and other capable management personnel. Although we believe we will be able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should the need arise, our inability to doso could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Because of the complex nature of many of our products and services, we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilledworkforce. In addition, there are significant costs associated with the hiring and training of sales professionals. We could be adversely affected by a shortage of available skilled employees or the loss of a significant number of our salesprofessionals.    Any product liability claims in excess ofinsurance may adversely affect our financial condition. Our operations expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of our products and the products we buy from third parties and sell toour customers. For example, we may be exposed to potential liability for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of a spring or other part in a vehicle or an aircraft component designed, manufactured or sold by us or the failure of anaircraft component that has been serviced by us or the components, including potentially hazardous substances, in a product purchased by us and sold by us to one of our customers. While we believe that our liability insurance is adequate to protectus from these liabilities, our insurance may not cover all liabilities. Additionally, insurance coverage may not be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us. Any material liability not covered by insurance or for which third-partyindemnification is not available could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted by strikes or work stoppages. Approximately 13%of our U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and 45% of our non-U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or statutory trade union agreements. We are currently negotiating a collective bargainingagreement with unionized employees at our Burlington, Ontario facility, representing a total of 74 employees. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are good, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in negotiating newcollective bargaining agreements, or that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor, including healthcare, pensions or other benefits. Any potential strikes or work stoppages, and the resulting adverse impact onour relationships with customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Similarly, a protracted strike or work stoppage at any of our major customers, suppliers or othervendors could materially adversely affect our business.    RISKS RELATED TOACQUISITIONS    We may not be able to effectivelyintegrate acquired companies into our operations. We have completed 15 acquisitions since 1999. We seek acquisition opportunities that complement and expand our operations and that will help create stockholder value over the long term. We cannotassure you that we will be able to effectively integrate our recent or future acquisitions into our operations. We may not be able to do so   9 Table of Contentssuccessfully without substantial costs, delays or other difficulties. We could face significant challenges in consolidating functions and integratingprocedures, information technology systems, personnel, product lines and operations in a timely and efficient manner. We may encounter difficulties in training our sales forces to work with new products and customers.    The integration process is complex and time-consuming, may be disruptive toour businesses, and may cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our businesses as a result of a number of obstacles, such as: the loss of significant customers; the need to retrain skilled engineering, sales and other personnel resultingfrom the loss of key employees; the failure to maintain the quality of customer service that each business has historically provided; the need to coordinate geographically diverse organizations; retooling and reprogramming of equipment andinformation technology systems; and the resulting diversion of managements attention from our day-to-day business and the need to hire additional management personnel to address integration obstacles.    If we are not successful in integrating our recent and future acquisitionsinto our operations, if the integration takes longer than anticipated, if the companies or assets we acquire do not perform as we anticipate, or if the integrated product and service offerings fail to achieve market acceptance, our business,financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.    We may not be able to realize the anticipated cost savings, synergies or revenue enhancements from acquisitions, and we may incur significant costs to achieve these savings. Even if we are able to integratesuccessfully our operations and the operations of our recent and any future acquisitions, we may not be able to realize the cost savings, synergies or revenue enhancements that we anticipate from these acquisitions, either as to amount or in thetime frame that we expect. Our ability to realize anticipated cost savings, synergies and revenue enhancements may be affected by a number of factors, including the following: our ability to effectively eliminate duplicative backoffice overhead andoverlapping sales personnel, rationalize manufacturing capacity, synchronize information technology systems, consolidate warehousing and distribution facilities and shift production to more economical facilities; our incurrence of significant cashand non-cash integration and implementation costs or charges in order to achieve those cost savings, which could offset any such savings and other synergies resulting from our recent or future acquisitions; and our ability to avoid labor disruptionin connection with integration efforts. In addition, our growth to date has placed, and future acquisitions could continue to place, significant demand on our administrative, operational and financial resources.    Future acquisitions and strategic alliances are a key component of ouranticipated growth. We may not be able to identify or complete future acquisitions or strategic alliances. A significant portion of the industries that we serve are mature industries. As a result, our recent growth has resulted in large partfrom, and our future growth will depend in part on, the successful acquisition and integration of businesses into our existing operations. While we are focused on adding strategic pieces to our operations by acquiring companies, manufacturing andservice assets and technologies that complement our existing businesses, we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions, obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms, obtain regulatory approval orotherwise complete acquisitions in the future. In addition, opportunities to enter into additional aftermarket RSP or alliances may be limited. Aftermarket RSPs will have an impact on the rate of future growth and profitability as a result of thebusiness mix between aftermarket and OEM, the number of new RSPs entered into, the level of aftermarket volume, increasing management fees, the amortization of the participation fees, and the expirations of the Singapore pioneer tax incentiveprogram on these programs.    RISKS RELATED TO THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WEOPERATE    We operate in very competitive markets. We maynot be able to compete effectively with our competitors, and competitive pressures could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our three business segments compete with a number of larger and smallercompanies in the markets we serve. Some of our competitors have greater financial, production, research and development or other resources than we do. Within Barnes Aerospace, certain of our OEM customers compete with our repair and   10 Table of Contentsoverhaul business. Some of our OEM customers in the aerospace industry also compete with us where they have the ability to manufacture the components andassemblies that we supply to them but have chosen, for capacity limitations, cost considerations or other reasons, to outsource the manufacture to us. Our three businesses compete on the basis of price, service, quality, reliability of supply,technology, innovation and, in the case of Associated Spring and Barnes Aerospace, design. We must continue to make investments to maintain and improve our competitive position. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continueto make such investments or that we will be successful in maintaining our competitive position. Our competitors may develop products or services, or methods of delivering those products or services, that are superior to our products, services ormethods. Our competitors may also adapt more quickly than we to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. Pricing pressures could cause us to adjust the prices of certain of our products to stay competitive. We cannot assure you that wewill be able to compete successfully with our existing or future competitors. Also, if consolidation of our existing competitors occurs, we expect the competitive pressures we face to increase. Our failure to compete successfully could adverselyaffect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    Our customers businesses are generally cyclical. Weaknesses in the industries in which our customers operate could impact our revenues and profitability. The industries to which we sell our products arecyclical and tend to decline in response to overall declines in industrial production. Associated Spring is dependent on the transportation industry, and Barnes Aerospace is heavily dependent on the aerospace industry, both of which are cyclical. Asa result, our business is also cyclical. In addition, many of our customers have historically experienced periodic downturns, which often have had a negative effect on demand for our products. For example, lower production rates in thetransportation markets and reduced overall sales of telecommunications and electronics products adversely affect the volume and price of orders placed for products used to manufacture these products, including our springs. Prior industry downturnshave negatively affected our net sales, gross margin, net income and cash flows. For example, there was a downturn in the aerospace industry in the beginning of this decade which resulted in a sharp decrease globally in new commercial aircraftdeliveries, order cancellations or deferrals by the major airlines and reduced demand for our aerospace components and overhaul and repair services. While there has been a recovery in commercial air traffic, any future downturn could adverselyaffect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    Original equipment manufacturers in the transportation and aerospace industries have significant pricing leverage over suppliers and may be able to achieve price reductions over time. There is substantial andcontinuing pressure from OEMs in the transportation, including automotive and aerospace industries to reduce the prices they pay to suppliers. We attempt to manage such downward pricing pressure, while trying to preserve our business relationshipswith our customers, by seeking to reduce our production costs through various measures, including purchasing raw materials and components at lower prices and implementing cost-effective process improvements. Our suppliers, have periodically resistedand, in the future, may resist pressure to lower their prices and may seek to impose price increases. In the past, our efforts to convince our key transportation OEM customers to share in raw material price increases were met with limited success.If we are unable to offset OEM price reductions through these measures, our gross margins, profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, OEMs have substantial leverage in setting purchasing and payment terms, including theterms of accelerated payment programs under which payments are made prior to the account due date in return for an early payment discount. OEMs can unexpectedly change their purchasing policies or payment practices, which could have a negativeimpact on our short-term working capital.    Demand for ourdefense-related products depends on government spending. An increasing portion of Barnes Aerospaces sales are derived from the military market. The military market is largely dependent upon government budgets, particularly the U.S. defensebudget. The funding of government programs is subject to Congressional appropriation. Although multi-year contracts may be authorized in connection with major procurements, Congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though aprogram may be expected to continue for several years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations. We cannot assure you that an increase in   11 Table of Contentsdefense spending will be allocated to programs that would benefit our business. Moreover, we cannot assure you that new military aircraft programs in whichwe participate will enter full-scale production as expected. A decrease in levels of defense spending or the governments termination of, or failure to fully fund, one or more of the contracts for the programs in which we participate could havea material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.    A downturn in the transportation industry could adversely affect our business and financial results. We derive a large portion of our sales from the transportation industry. Recently, that industry has sufferedfrom certain financial pressures which have had negative consequences for companies in or with customers in the transportation industry. The transportation industry has generally suffered from unfavorable pricing pressures in North America andEurope. The operation of our business within that industry subjects us to the pressures applicable to all companies operating in it. While the precise effects of such instability on the transportation industry are difficult to determine, they maynegatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    The consolidation occurring in the industries in which we operate could adversely affect our business and financial results. The industries in which we operate have been experiencing consolidation, particularlyin the aerospace industry. There has been consolidation of both suppliers, including us and our competitors, and the customers we serve. Supplier consolidation is in part attributable to OEMs more frequently awarding long-term sole source orpreferred supplier contracts to the most capable suppliers in an effort to reduce the total number of suppliers from whom components and systems are purchased. We cannot assure you that our business, financial condition, results of operations orcash flows will not be adversely impacted as a result of consolidation by our competitors or customers.    The aerospace industry is highly regulated. Complications related to aerospace regulations may adversely affect Barnes Aerospace. A substantialportion of our income is derived from our aerospace business. The aerospace industry is highly regulated in the United States by the Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, and in other countries by similar regulatory agencies. We must be certifiedby these agencies and, in some cases, by individual OEMs in order to engineer and service systems and components used in specific aircraft models. If material authorizations or approvals were delayed, revoked or suspended, Barnes Aerospace would beadversely affected. New or more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted, or industry oversight heightened, in the future, and we may incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or any heightened industry oversight.   Environmental regulations impose costs and regulatoryrequirements on our operations. Environmental compliance may be more costly than we expect, and we may be subject to material environmental-based claims in the future. Our past and present business operations and past and present ownership andoperations of real property and the use, sale, storage and handling of chemicals and hazardous products, subject us to extensive and changing federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, as well as those of other countries,pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, enforcement, disposition of wastes (including hazardous wastes), the use, shipping, labeling, and storage of chemicals and hazardous materials, or otherwise relating to protection of theenvironment. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations. In addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery ofpreviously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become subject to new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, resultsof operations and cash flows.    We use and generate hazardoussubstances and wastes in our operations. In addition, many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we monitor hazardous waste management and applicable environmental permitting and reportingfor compliance with applicable laws at our locations in the ordinary course of our business. We may be subject to potential material liabilities relating to any investigation and clean-up of our locations or properties where we delivered hazardouswaste for handling or disposal that may be contaminated and to claims alleging personal injury.   12 Table of ContentsHigh fuel prices may impact our operating results. Fuel costs constitute a significant portion ofoperating expenses for companies in the aerospace industry. Widespread disruption to oil production, refinery operations and pipeline capacity in certain areas of the United States can increase the price of jet fuel significantly. Conflicts in theMiddle East, an important source of oil for the U.S. and other countries where we do business, cause prices for fuel to be volatile and often significantly higher than historic levels. Because many of our customers and we are in the aerospaceindustry, increased fuel costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. The price of fuel generally impacts the cost of operating our manufacturing and distribution operations. Additionally, higherfuel costs may increase our freight expenses.    Products andservices of the mature industries in which we operate may be rendered obsolete by new products, technologies and processes. Our manufacturing operations focus on highly engineered components which require extensive engineering and research anddevelopment time. Our competitive advantage may be adversely impacted if we cannot continue to introduce new products ahead of our competition, or if our products are rendered obsolete by other products or by new, different technologies andprocesses.   "

    Ourbusiness, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Please note that additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impact our business andoperations.   4 Table of ContentsRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS    Changes in the availability or price of materials and energy resources could adversely affect our costs andprofitability. We may be adversely affected by the availability or price of raw materials and energy resources, particularly related to certain manufacturing operations that utilize high-grade steel spring wire and titanium. The availability andprice of raw materials and energy resources may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, new laws or regulations, global economic or political events including strikes, terrorist attacks and war, suppliers allocations toother purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. Although we are not dependent upon any single source for any of our principal raw materials or products for resale, and such materialsand products have, historically, been readily available, we cannot assure you that such raw materials and products will continue to be readily available. Disruption in the supply of raw materials, products or energy resources or our inability tocome to favorable agreements with our suppliers could impair our ability to manufacture, sell and deliver our products and require us to pay higher prices. Any increase in prices for such raw materials, products or energy resources could materiallyaffect our costs and our profitability.    We depend onrevenues from a small number of significant customers. Any loss, cancellation, reduction or delay in purchases by these customers could harm our business. Our success will depend on our continued ability to develop and manage relationships withsignificant customers. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our largest customers. Some of our customers may in the future shift their purchases from us to our competitors, in-house or to other sources. While we have long-termagreements with most of our significant customers, the terms of some of these agreements provide that until a firm order is placed by a customer for a particular product, the customer may unilaterally reduce or discontinue its projected purchaseswithout penalty. The loss of one or more of our largest customers, any reduction or delay in sales to these customers, our inability to successfully develop relationships with new customers, or future price concessions we make to retain customerscould significantly reduce our sales and profitability.    Theglobal nature of our business exposes us to foreign currency fluctuations that may affect our future revenues and profitability. We have manufacturing, sales and distribution facilities around the world, and the majority of our foreignsubsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency. Because our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies expose us to translation risk whenthe local currency financial statements are translated to U.S. dollars, our functional currency. Changes in currency exchange rates may also expose us to transaction risk. We may buy protecting or offsetting positions or hedges in certain currenciesto reduce our exposure to currency exchange fluctuations; however, these transactions may not be adequate or effective to protect us from the exposure for which they are purchased. We have not engaged in any speculative hedging activities. Currencyfluctuations may impact our revenues and profitability in the future.    Our operations depend on our manufacturing, distribution, sales and service facilities in various parts of the world which are subject to physical, financial, regulatory and other risks that could disrupt our operations. Theinternational scope of our business subjects us to risks such as a threat of war, terrorism or instability of governments and legal systems in countries in which we or our customers conduct business. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001adversely impacted the U.S. and world economies and a wide range of industries. These terrorist attacks and the war in the Middle East may lead to future acts of terrorism and additional hostilities, including possible retaliatory attacks, as wellas financial, economic and political instability. In addition, because we depend upon our information systems to help process orders, to manage inventory and accounts receivables collections, to purchase, sell and ship products efficiently and on atimely basis, to maintain cost-effective operations, and to help provide superior service to our customers, any disruption in the operation of our information systems, including widespread power outages such as those that affected the northeasternand midwestern United States in August 2003, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    Although we have obtained property damage and business interruption insurance, a major catastrophe such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood or othernatural disaster at any of our sites, or significant labor strikes, work   5 Table of Contentsstoppages, political unrest, or any of the events described above, some of which may not be covered by our insurance, in any of the areas where we conductoperations could result in a prolonged interruption of our business. Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in the manufacture or shipment of products or the provision of repair and other services that may resultin our loss of sales and customers. Our insurance will not cover all potential risks, and we cannot assure you that we will have adequate insurance to compensate us for all losses that result from any insured risks. Any material loss not covered byinsurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We cannot assure you that insurance will be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us or at a cost that will not have amaterial adverse effect on our gross margins, net income and cash flows.    Our significant international operations and assets subject us to additional financial and regulatory risks. We have operations and assets in various parts of the world. In addition, we sell our products andservices in foreign countries and seek to increase our level of international business activity. Accordingly, we are subject to various risks, including: U.S.-imposed embargoes of sales to specific countries; foreign import controls (which may bearbitrarily imposed or enforced); export regulations (which require us to comply with stringent licensing regimes); anti-dumping regulations; price and currency controls; exchange rate fluctuations; dividend remittance restrictions; expropriation ofassets; war, civil uprisings and riots; government instability; the necessity of obtaining governmental approval for new and continuing products and operations; legal systems or decrees, laws, taxes, regulations, interpretations and court decisionsthat are not always fully developed and that may be retroactively or arbitrarily applied; and difficulties in managing a global enterprise. We have experienced minor or technical violations of some of these regulations, including export regulations,in the past, none of which have had or, we believe, will have a material adverse effect on our business. However, any significant violations of these regulations in the future could result in civil or criminal sanctions, the loss of export or otherlicenses which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may also be subject to unanticipated income taxes, excise duties, import taxes, export taxes or other governmental assessments. In addition, our organizational structure maylimit our ability to transfer funds between countries, particularly into and out of the United States, without incurring adverse tax consequences. Any of these events could result in a loss of business or other unexpected costs that could reducesales or profits and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    We maintain pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the U.S. and certain international locations. Declines in the stock market,prevailing interest rates and rising medical costs may cause an increase in our pension and other postretirement benefit expenses in the future and result in reductions in our pension fund asset values and increases in our pension and otherpostretirement benefit obligations. These changes have caused and may continue to cause a significant reduction in our net worth and may require us to make higher cash contributions to our pension and postretirement plans in the future.   We have significant indebtedness that could affect our operations andfinancial condition. We may incur additional indebtedness to finance future acquisitions. Our level of indebtedness and the significant debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operations andfinancial condition and may adversely affect the value or trading price of our outstanding equity securities and debt securities. For example, our indebtedness could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations topayments on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes inthe industries in which we compete; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors, some of whom have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources than we do; limit our ability to borrow additional funds; andincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions.    Our failure to meet certain financial covenants required by our debt agreements may materially and adversely affect our assets, financial position and cash flows. Certain of our debt arrangements require us tomaintain certain interest coverage and leverage ratios and a minimum net worth. These requirements could limit   6 Table of Contentsour ability to obtain future financing and may prevent us from taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. Our ability to meet the financialcovenants or requirements in our debt arrangements may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with therestrictions could result in an event of default under our debt arrangements, which in turn could result in an event of default under the terms of our other indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our debt arrangements, afterthe expiration of any grace periods, our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our debt arrangements, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this happens, we cannot assure you that our assetswould be sufficient to repay in full the payments due under those arrangements or our other indebtedness.    We have significant goodwill and an impairment of our goodwill could cause a decline in our net worth. Our total assets include substantialgoodwill. The goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of the purchase price we paid over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets we acquired. We assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of ourgoodwill during each calendar year or sooner if triggering events warrant. If future operating performance at one or more of our businesses does not meet expectations, we may be required to reflect, under current applicable accounting rules, anon-cash charge to operating results for goodwill impairment. The recognition of an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material. Areduction in our stockholders equity due to an impairment of goodwill may affect our ability to maintain the required net worth ratios under our debt arrangements.    We may not realize all of the sales expected from our existing Associated Spring and Barnes Aerospace backlog oranticipated orders. There can be no assurances that the revenues projected in our backlog will be realized or, if realized, will result in profits. We consider backlog to be firm customer orders for future delivery. From time to time, OEMcustomers of Associated Spring and Barnes Aerospace provide projections of components and assemblies that they anticipate purchasing in the future under new and existing programs. Such projections are not included in our backlog unless we havereceived a firm release from our customers. Our customers may have the right under certain circumstances and with certain penalties or consequences to terminate, reduce or defer firm orders that we have in backlog. If our customers terminate, reduceor defer firm orders, we may be protected from certain costs and losses, but our sales will nevertheless be adversely affected. Although we strive to maintain ongoing relationships with our customers, there is an ongoing risk that orders may becancelled or rescheduled due to fluctuations in our customers business needs or purchasing budgets.    Also, our realization of sales from new and existing programs is inherently subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties, including whetherour customers will execute the launch of product programs on time, or at all, the number of units that our customers will actually produce and the timing of production. In addition, until firm orders are placed, our customers generally have theright to discontinue a program or replace us with another supplier at any time without penalty. Our failure to realize sales from new and existing programs could have a material adverse effect on our net sales, results of operations and cash flows.   We may not recover all of our up-front costs related to newor existing programs. New programs require significant up-front investments and capital expenditures for engineering, design and tooling. As OEMs in the automotive and aerospace industries have looked to suppliers to bear increasingresponsibility for the design, engineering and manufacture of systems and components, they have increasingly shifted the financial risk associated with those responsibilities to the suppliers as well. This trend is likely to continue and is mostevident in the area of engineering cost reimbursement. Historically, these investments have been fully reimbursed by OEMs, but in the future there may be other mechanisms established by OEMs that could result in less than full reimbursement or noreimbursement. We cannot assure you that we will have adequate funds to make such up-front investments and capital expenditures. In the event that we are unable to make such investments and expenditures, or to recover them through sales or directreimbursement of our engineering expenses from our customers, our profitability, liquidity and cash flows may be adversely affected. In addition, we incur costs and   7 Table of Contentsmake capital expenditures for new program awards based upon certain estimates of production volumes. While we attempt to recover such costs and capitalexpenditures by appropriately pricing our products, the prices of our products are based in part upon planned production volumes. If the actual production is significantly less than planned, we will be unable to recover such costs. In addition,because a significant portion of our overall costs is fixed, declines in our customers production levels can adversely affect the level of our reported results even if our up-front investments and capital expenditures are recovered.   We may not recover all of our up-front costs related toRSPs. We participate in aftermarket RSPs under which we receive an exclusive right to supply designated aftermarket parts to a large aerospace manufacturer over the life of an aircraft engine program. As consideration, we pay participation fees,which are recorded as long-lived intangible assets, and are recognized as a reduction to sales over the life of the program. The recoverability of the asset is dependent upon future revenues related to the programs aftermarket parts. Thepotential exists that actual revenues will not meet expectations. A shortfall in future revenues may result in the failure to recover the total amount of the investments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operationsand cash flows.    We face risks of cost overruns and losseson fixed-price contracts. We sell certain of our products under firm, fixed-price contracts providing for a fixed price for the products regardless of the production costs incurred by us. The cost of producing products may be adversely affectedby increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, outside processing, overhead and other factors, including manufacturing inefficiencies. Increased production costs may result in cost overruns and losses on contracts.    The departure of existing management and key personnel, a shortage ofskilled employees or a lack of qualified sales professionals could materially affect our business, operations and prospects. Our executive officers are important to the management and direction of our business. Our future success depends, inlarge part, on our ability to retain these officers and other capable management personnel. Although we believe we will be able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should the need arise, our inability to do so couldhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Because of the complex nature of many of our products and services, we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilled workforce. Inaddition, there are significant costs associated with the hiring and training of sales professionals. We could be adversely affected by a shortage of available skilled employees or the loss of a significant number of our sales professionals.   Any product liability claims in excess of insurance mayadversely affect our financial condition. Our operations expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of our products. For example, we may be exposed to potential liability for personalinjury or death as a result of the failure of a spring or other part in a vehicle or an aircraft component designed, manufactured or sold by us or the failure of an aircraft component that has been serviced by us. While we believe that our liabilityinsurance is adequate to protect us from these liabilities, our insurance may not cover all liabilities. Additionally, insurance coverage may not be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us. Any material liability not covered by insuranceor for which third-party indemnification is not available could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.   Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted by strikes or work stoppages. Certain of ourU.S. employees and our non-U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements which expire between 2006 and 2009. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are good, we cannot assure you that we will be successful innegotiating new collective bargaining agreements. Any potential strikes or work stoppages, and the resulting adverse impact on our relationships with customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results ofoperations or cash flows. Similarly, a protracted strike or work stoppage at any of our major customers, suppliers or other vendors could materially adversely affect our business.   8 Table of ContentsRISKS RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS    We may not be able to effectively integrate acquired companies into our operations. We have completed over 10acquisitions since 1999. We seek acquisition opportunities that complement and expand our operations and that will help create stockholder value over the long term. We cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively integrate our recent orfuture acquisitions into our operations. We may not be able to do so successfully without substantial costs, delays or other difficulties. We could face significant challenges in consolidating functions and integrating procedures, informationtechnology systems, personnel, product lines and operations in a timely and efficient manner. We may encounter difficulties in training our sales forces to work with new products and customers.    We may not be able to realize the anticipated cost savings, synergies orrevenue enhancements from acquisitions, and we may incur significant costs to achieve these savings. Even if we are able to integrate successfully the operations of our Company and our recent and any future acquisitions, we may not be able torealize the cost savings, synergies or revenue enhancements that we anticipate from these acquisitions, either as to amount or in the time frame that we expect. Our ability to realize anticipated cost savings, synergies and revenue enhancements maybe affected by a number of factors, including the following: our ability to effectively eliminate duplicative backoffice overhead and overlapping sales personnel, rationalize manufacturing capacity, consolidate warehousing and distributionfacilities and shift production to more economical facilities; our incurrence of significant cash and non-cash integration and implementation costs or charges in order to achieve those cost savings, which could offset any such savings and othersynergies resulting from our recent or future acquisitions; and our ability to avoid labor disruption in connection with integration efforts. In addition, our growth to date has placed, and future acquisitions could continue to place, significantdemand on our administrative, operational and financial resources.    Future acquisitions are a key component of our anticipated growth. We may not be able to identify or complete future acquisitions. A significant portion of the industries that we serve are mature industries. As a result, our recentgrowth has resulted in large part from, and our future growth will depend in part on, the successful acquisition and integration of businesses into our existing operations. While we are focused on adding strategic pieces to our operations byacquiring companies, manufacturing and service assets and technologies that complement our three existing businesses, we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions, obtain financing for future acquisitions onsatisfactory terms, obtain regulatory approval or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future.    RISKS RELATED TO THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE    We operate in very competitive markets. We may not be able to compete effectively with our competitors, and competitive pressures could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our three business segments compete with a number of larger and smaller companies in the markets we serve. Some of our competitors have greater financial, production, research and development or other resources than we do. Within BarnesAerospace, certain of our OEM customers compete with our repair and overhaul business. Some of our OEM customers in the aerospace industry also compete with us where they have the ability to manufacture the components and assemblies that we supplyto them but have chosen, for capacity limitations, cost considerations or other reasons, to outsource the manufacture to us. Our three businesses compete on the basis of price, service, quality, reliability of supply, technology, innovation and, inthe case of Associated Spring and Barnes Aerospace, design. We must continue to make investments to maintain and improve our competitive position. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments orthat we will be successful in maintaining our competitive position. Our competitors may develop products or services, or methods of delivering those products or services, that are superior to our products, services or methods. Our competitors mayalso adapt more quickly than we to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. Pricing pressures could cause us to adjust the prices of certain of our products to stay competitive. We cannot assure you that we will be able to competesuccessfully with our existing or future competitors. Also, if consolidation of our existing competitors occurs, we expect the competitive pressures   9 Table of Contentswe face to increase. Our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.   Our customers businesses are generally cyclical.Weaknesses in the industries in which our customers operate could impact our revenues and profitability. The industries to which we sell our products are cyclical and tend to decline in response to overall declines in industrial production.Associated Spring is dependent on the transportation industry, and Barnes Aerospace is heavily dependent on the aerospace industry. As a result, our business is also cyclical and impacted by overall levels of industrial production and fluctuationsin the transportation and aerospace industries. In addition, many of our customers have historically experienced periodic downturns, which often have had a negative effect on demand for our products. For example, lower production rates in thetransportation markets and reduced overall sales of telecommunications and electronics products adversely affect the volume and price of orders placed for products used to manufacture these products, including our springs. Prior industry downturnshave negatively affected our net sales, gross margin, net income and cash flows. For instance, the aerospace industry recently had a period of downturn. While there has been a recovery in commercial air traffic, the commercial airline industrycontinues to be subject to financial difficulties, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    Original equipment manufacturers in the automotive and aerospace industries have significant pricing leverage over suppliers and may be able to achieveprice reductions over time. There is substantial and continuing pressure from OEMs in the automotive and aerospace industries to reduce the prices they pay to suppliers. We attempt to manage such downward pricing pressure, while trying topreserve our business relationships with our customers, by seeking to reduce our production costs through various measures, including purchasing raw materials and components at lower prices and implementing cost-effective process improvements.However, our suppliers, in the past, have resisted and, in the future, may resist pressure to lower their prices and may seek to impose price increases. In 2005, our efforts to convince our key automotive OEM customers to share in raw material priceincreases were met with limited success. If we are unable to offset OEM price reductions through these measures, our gross margins, profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, OEMs have substantial leverage in settingpurchasing and payment terms, including the terms of accelerated payment programs under which payments are made prior to the account due date in return for an early payment discount. OEMs can unexpectedly change their purchasing policies or paymentpractices, which could have a negative impact on our short-term working capital.    Demand for our defense-related products depends on government spending. An increasing portion of Barnes Aerospaces sales are derived from the military market. The military market is largely dependent upongovernment budgets, particularly the U.S. defense budget. The funding of government programs is subject to Congressional appropriation. Although multi-year contracts may be authorized in connection with major procurements, Congress generallyappropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may be expected to continue for several years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations.We cannot assure you that an increase in defense spending will be allocated to programs that would benefit our business. Moreover, we cannot assure you that new military aircraft programs in which we participate will enter full-scale production asexpected. A decrease in levels of defense spending or the governments termination of, or failure to fully fund, one or more of the contracts for the programs in which we participate could have a material adverse effect on our financialposition and results of operations.    A downturn in theautomotive industry could adversely affect our business and financial results. We derive a significant portion of our sales from sales to the automotive industry. Recently, the automotive industry has suffered from certain financial pressureswhich have had negative consequences for companies in or with customers in the automotive industry. The automotive industry has generally suffered from unfavorable pricing pressures in North America and Europe. The operation of our business withinthe automotive industry subjects us to the pressures applicable to all companies operating in the automotive industry. While the precise effects of such instability on the automotive industry are difficult to determine, they may negatively impactour business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.   10 Table of ContentsThe consolidation occurring in the industries in which we operate could adversely affect our businessand financial results. The industries in which we operate have been experiencing consolidation, particularly in the aerospace industry. There has been consolidation of both suppliers, including us and our competitors, and the customers we serve.Supplier consolidation is in part attributable to OEMs more frequently awarding long-term sole source or preferred supplier contracts to the most capable suppliers in an effort to reduce the total number of suppliers from whom components and systemsare purchased. We cannot assure you that our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows will not be adversely impacted as a result of consolidation by our competitors or customers.    The aerospace industry is highly regulated. Complications related toaerospace regulations may adversely affect Barnes Aerospace. A substantial portion of our income is derived from our aerospace business. The aerospace industry is highly regulated in the United States by the Federal Aviation Administration, orFAA, and in other countries by similar regulatory agencies. We must be certified by these agencies and, in some cases, by individual OEMs in order to engineer and service systems and components used in specific aircraft models. If materialauthorizations or approvals were delayed in being issued, revoked or suspended, Barnes Aerospace would be adversely affected. New or more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted, or industry oversight heightened, in the future, and we mayincur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or any heightened industry oversight.    Environmental regulations impose costs and regulatory requirements on our operations. Environmental compliance may be more costly than we expect, andwe may be subject to material environmental-based claims in the future. Our past and present business operations and past and present ownership and operations of real property subject us to extensive and changing federal, state and localenvironmental laws and regulations, as well as those of other countries, pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, the handling and disposition of wastes (including hazardous wastes) or otherwise relating to protection of theenvironment. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations. In addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery ofpreviously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become subject to new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, resultsof operations and cash flows.    We use and generate hazardoussubstances and wastes in our operations. In addition, many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we monitor hazardous waste management and applicable environmental permitting and reportingfor compliance with applicable laws at our locations in the ordinary course of our business. We may be subject to potential material liabilities relating to any investigation and clean-up of our locations or properties where we delivered hazardouswaste for handling or disposal that may be contaminated and to claims alleging personal injury.    High fuel prices may impact our operating results. Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of operating expenses for companies in the aerospaceindustry. Recent hurricanes caused widespread disruption to oil production, refinery operations and pipeline capacity in certain areas of the United States, and, as a result, the price of jet fuel has increased significantly. Because many of ourcustomers and we are in the aerospace industry, increased fuel costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, the sales force of our distribution business incurs significant fuel costsin the course of business.   "
