6,FUL,FULLER (H. B.) CO,2024-01-24,"Risk Factors
  As a global manufacturer of adhesives, sealants and other specialty chemical products, we operate in a business environment that is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Below are the most significant factors that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Strategic and Operational Risks Increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials have adversely affected, and could continue to erode, our profit margins, and could negatively impact our operating results. In 2023, raw material costs made up approximately 75 percent of our cost of sales. Based on 2023 financial results, a hypothetical one percent change in our raw material costs would have resulted in a change in net income of approximately $13.3 million or $0.24 per diluted share.  Accordingly, changes in the cost of raw materials, due to scarcity, supplier disruptions, inflation and for other reasons, can significantly impact our earnings. Raw materials needed to manufacture products are obtained from a number of suppliers and many of the raw materials are petroleum and natural gas based derivatives. Under normal market conditions, these raw materials are generally available on the open market from a variety of producers. While alternate supplies of most key raw materials are available, supplier production outages may lead to strained supply-demand situations for certain raw materials. The substitution of key raw materials requires us to identify new supply sources, reformulate and re-test and may require seeking re-approval from our customers using those products. From time to time, the prices and availability of these raw materials may fluctuate, which could impair our ability to procure necessary materials, or increase the cost of manufacturing products. If the prices of raw materials increase in a short period of time, we may be unable to pass these increases on to our customers in a timely manner and could experience reductions to our profit margins. We are at risk of cyber-attacks or other security breaches that could compromise sensitive business information, undermine our ability to operate effectively and expose us to liability, which could cause our business and reputation to suffer. Increasingly, companies are subject to a wide variety of attacks on their networks on an ongoing basis. In addition to traditional computer “hackers,” malicious code (such as viruses and worms), phishing attempts, ransomware, employee theft or misuse, and denial of service attacks, sophisticated nation-state and nation-state supported actors engage in intrusions and attacks (including advanced persistent threat intrusions) and add to the risks to internal networks, cloud deployed enterprise and customer-facing environments and the information they store and process. Despite significant efforts to create security barriers to such threats, it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate these risks. We, and our third-party software and service providers, have experienced and will continue to experience security threats and attacks from a variety of sources.  As part of our business, we store our data, including intellectual property, and certain data about our employees, customers and vendors in our information technology systems. Our security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise. Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, or other information to gain access to our customers' data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems. In addition, given their size and complexity, our information systems could be vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, third-party vendors and/or business partners, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties attempting to gain unauthorized access to our products, systems or confidential information.         9     Table of Contents We are subject to increasingly complex and evolving laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls, that govern privacy and cybersecurity.  These laws and regulations have been adopted by multiple agencies at the federal and state level, as well as in foreign jurisdictions, and the regimes have not been harmonized.  Our failure to comply with these regulatory regimes may result in significant liabilities or penalties. If a third party gained unauthorized access to our data, including any data regarding our employees, customers or vendors, the security breach could expose us to risks. Such unauthorized access and a failure to effectively recover from breaches could compromise confidential information, disrupt our business, harm our reputation, result in the loss of customer confidence, business and assets (including trade secrets and other intellectual property), result in regulatory proceedings and legal claims, and have a negative impact on our financial results. Our business and operations have been, and may in the future, be adversely affected by epidemics, pandemics, outbreaks of disease and other adverse public health developments. Epidemics, pandemics, outbreaks of novel diseases and other adverse public health developments in countries and states where we operate may arise at any time. Such developments, including the COVID-19 pandemic, have had, and in the future may have, an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These effects include a potentially negative impact on the availability of our key personnel, labor shortages and increased turnover, temporary closures of our facilities or facilities of our business partners, customers, suppliers, third-party service providers or other vendors, and interruption of domestic and global supply chains, distribution channels and liquidity and capital or financial markets. In particular, restrictions on or disruptions of transportation, port closures or increased border controls or closures, or other impacts on domestic and global supply chains or distribution channels, could increase our costs for raw materials and commodity costs, increase demand for raw materials and commodities from competing purchasers, limit our ability to meet customer demand or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or cash flows. Precautionary measures that we may take in the future intended to limit the impact of any epidemic, pandemic, disease outbreak or other public health development, may result in additional costs. In addition, such epidemics, pandemics, disease outbreaks or other public health developments may adversely affect economies and financial markets throughout the world, such as the effect that COVID-19 has had on world economies and financial markets, which may affect our ability to obtain additional financing for our businesses and demand for our products and services. The extent to which major public health issues impact our business and our financial results in the future will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. As a result, it is not possible to predict the overall future impact of major public health issues on our business, liquidity, capital resources and financial results. We experience substantial competition in each of the operating segments and geographic areas in which we operate. Our wide variety of products are sold in numerous markets, each of which is highly competitive. Our competitive position in markets is, in part, subject to external factors. For example, supply and demand for certain of our products is driven by end-use markets and worldwide capacities which, in turn, impact demand for and pricing of our products. Many of our direct competitors are part of large multinational companies and may have more resources than we do. Any increase in competition may result in lost market share or reduced prices, which could result in reduced profit margins. This may impair the ability to grow or even to maintain current levels of revenues and earnings. While we have an extensive customer base, loss of certain top customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations until such business is replaced, and no assurances can be made that we would be able to regain or replace any lost customers. Failure to develop and/or acquire new products and protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our future performance and growth.  Ongoing innovation and product development are important factors in our competitiveness, as is acquisition of new technologies. Failure to create and/or acquire new products and generate new ideas could negatively impact our ability to grow and deliver strong financial results. We may face difficulties marketing products produced using new technologies including, but not limited to, sustainable adhesives, which may adversely impact our sales and financial results.  Failure of the products to work as predicted could lead to liability and damage to our reputation. We continually apply for and obtain U.S. and foreign patents to protect the results of our research for use in our operations and licensing. We are party to a number of patent licenses and other technology agreements. We rely on patents, confidentiality agreements and internal security measures to protect our intellectual property. Failure to protect this intellectual property could negatively affect our future performance and growth.        10     Table of Contents Our operations may present health and safety risks. Notwithstanding our emphasis on the safety of our employees and contractors and the precautions we take related to health and safety, we may be unable to avoid safety incidents relating to our operations that result in injuries or deaths. Certain safety incidents may result in legal or regulatory action that could result in increased expenses or reputational damage. We maintain workers' compensation insurance to address the risk of incurring material liabilities for injuries or deaths, but there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage will be adequate or will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could result in material liabilities to us for any injuries or deaths. Changes to federal, state and local employee health and safety regulations, and legislative, regulatory or societal responses to safety incidents may result in heightened regulations or public scrutiny that may increase our compliance costs or result in reputational damage. A failure in our information technology systems could negatively impact our business.  We rely on information technology to record and process transactions, manage our business and maintain the financial accuracy of our records. Our computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from various sources, including power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, vandalism, catastrophic events and human error. Interruptions of our computer systems could disrupt our business, for example by leading to plant downtime and/or power outages and could result in the loss of business and cause us to incur additional expense. We are in the process of implementing a global Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system, including upgrading to SAP S/4HANA® which is anticipated to occur at the beginning of fiscal 2025, that we refer to as Project ONE, which will upgrade and standardize our information system. Implementation of Project ONE began in our North America adhesives business in 2014 and, through 2023, we completed implementation of this system in various parts of our business including Latin America (except Brazil), Australia and various other businesses in North America and Europe, India, Middle East and Africa (EIMEA). During 2024 and beyond, we will continue implementation in North America; Europe, India, the Middle East and Africa (""EIMEA""); Brazil and Asia Pacific. Any delays or other failure to achieve our implementation goals may adversely impact our financial results. In addition, the failure to either deliver the application on time or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs could lead to business disruption and loss of business. Failure or abandonment of any part of the ERP system could result in a write-off of part or all of the costs that have been capitalized on the project. Risks associated with acquisitions could have an adverse effect on us and the inability to execute organizational restructuring may affect our results. As part of our growth strategy, we have made, and will likely continue to make, acquisitions of complementary businesses or products. The ability to grow through acquisitions depends upon our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate suitable acquisitions. If we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing business, our results of operations and our cash flows could be adversely affected. Our acquisition strategy also involves other risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return on capital, unidentified issues not discovered in our investigations and evaluations of those strategies and acquisitions, and difficulties implementing and maintaining consistent standards, controls, procedures, policies and systems. Future acquisitions could result in additional debt and other liabilities, and increased interest expense, restructuring charges and amortization expense related to intangible assets. Our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the United States, where there is the potential for significant economic and political disruptions. Our operations in these markets may be subject to greater risks than those faced by our operations in the United States, including political and economic instability, project delay or abandonment due to unanticipated government actions, inadequate investment in infrastructure, undeveloped property rights and legal systems, unfamiliar regulatory environments, relationships with local partners, language and cultural differences and increased difficulty recruiting, training and retaining qualified employees. In addition, our profitability is dependent on our ability to drive sustainable productivity improvements such as cost savings through organizational restructuring. Delays or unexpected costs may prevent us from realizing the full operational and financial benefits of such restructuring initiatives and may potentially disrupt our operations.        11     Table of Contents Macroeconomic Risks Uncertainties in foreign economic, political, regulatory and social conditions and fluctuations in foreign currency may adversely affect our results.  Approximately 56 percent, or $2.0 billion, of our net revenue was generated outside the United States in 2023. International operations could be adversely affected by changes in economic, political, regulatory, and social conditions, especially in Brazil, Russia, China, the Middle East, including Turkey and Egypt, and other developing or emerging markets where we do business. An economic downturn in the businesses or geographic areas in which we sell our products could reduce demand for these products and result in a decrease in sales volume that could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Product demand often depends on end-use markets. Economic conditions that reduce consumer confidence or discretionary spending may reduce product demand. Challenging economic conditions may also impair the ability of our customers to pay for products they have purchased, and as a result, our reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. In addition, trade protection measures, anti-bribery and anti-corruption regulations, restrictions on repatriation of earnings and cash, currency controls implemented by foreign governments, differing intellectual property rights and changes in legal and regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs could adversely affect our results of operations. Fluctuations and volatility in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could potentially result in increases or decreases in net revenue, cost of raw materials and earnings and may adversely affect the value of our assets outside the United States. In 2023, the change in foreign currencies negatively impacted our net revenue by approximately $88.5 million. In 2023, we spent approximately $1.9 billion for raw materials worldwide of which approximately $1.0 billion was purchased outside the United States. Based on 2023 financial results, a hypothetical one percent change in our cost of sales due to foreign currency rate changes would have resulted in a change in net income of approximately $9.4 million or $0.17 per diluted share. Although we utilize risk management tools, including hedging, as appropriate, to mitigate market fluctuations in foreign currencies, any changes in strategy in regard to risk management tools can also affect revenue, expenses and results of operations and there can be no assurance that such measures will result in cost savings or that all market fluctuation exposure will be eliminated. Distressed financial markets may result in dramatic deflation of financial asset valuations and high interest rates may disrupt the availability of capital.  Adverse equity market conditions and volatility in the credit markets could have a negative impact on the value of our pension trust assets, our future estimated pension liabilities and other postretirement benefit plans. In addition, we could be required to provide increased pension plan funding. As a result, our financial results could be negatively impacted. In a rising interest rate environment, more costly debt and reduced access to capital markets may affect our ability to invest in strategic growth initiatives such as acquisitions. In addition, the reduced credit availability could limit our customers’ ability to invest in their businesses, refinance maturing debt obligations, or meet their ongoing working capital needs. If these customers do not have sufficient access to the financial markets, demand for our products may decline. The military conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas, and the global response to these events, could adversely impact our revenues, gross margins and financial results. The U.S. government and other nations have imposed significant restrictions on most companies’ ability to do business in Russia as a result of the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Increases in energy demand and supply disruptions caused by the Russia and Ukraine conflict have resulted in significantly higher energy prices, particularly in Europe. Further, in October 2023, a military conflict commenced between Israel and Hamas. It is not possible to predict the broader or longer-term consequences of these conflicts, which could include further sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, energy shortages, geopolitical shifts and adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, security conditions, currency exchange rates and financial markets. Such geopolitical instability and uncertainty could have a negative impact on our ability to sell to, ship products to, collect payments from, and support customers in certain regions based on trade restrictions, embargoes and export control law restrictions, and logistics restrictions including closures of air space, and could increase the costs, risks and adverse impacts from these new challenges. We may also be the subject of increased cyber-attacks.  While the countries involved in these conflicts do not constitute a material portion of our business, a significant escalation or expansion of economic disruption or the conflicts' current scope could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.        12     Table of Contents Catastrophic events could disrupt our operations or the operations of our suppliers or customers, having a negative impact on our financial results. Unexpected events, including global pandemics, natural disasters and severe weather events, fires or explosions at our facilities or those of our suppliers, acts of war or terrorism, supply disruptions or breaches of security of our information technology systems could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm our operations, our customers and our suppliers. Such events could reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers and deliver products to our customers. Legal and Regulatory Risks The impact of changing laws or regulations or the manner of interpretation or enforcement of existing laws or regulations could adversely impact our financial performance and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase our cost of doing business and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. In addition, compliance with laws and regulations is complicated by our substantial global footprint, which will require significant and additional resources to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the various countries where we conduct business. Our global operations expose us to trade and economic sanctions and other restrictions imposed by the U.S., the EU and other governments and organizations. The U.S. Departments of Justice, Commerce, State, Homeland Security, and Treasury and other federal agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals for violations of economic sanctions laws, export control laws, the FCPA and other federal statutes and regulations, including those established by the OFAC. Under these laws and regulations, as well as other anti-corruption laws, anti-money-laundering laws, export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations, various government agencies may require export licenses, may seek to impose modifications to business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned persons or entities and modifications to compliance programs, including import restrictions, which may increase compliance costs, and may subject us to fines, penalties and other sanctions. A violation of these laws, regulations, policies or procedures could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we have implemented policies and procedures in these areas, we cannot assure that our policies and procedures are sufficient or that directors, officers, employees, representatives, manufacturers, suppliers and agents have not engaged and will not engage in conduct in violation of such policies and procedures. Costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental laws and regulations may negatively impact our operations and financial results.  We are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that impose various environmental controls on us or otherwise relate to environmental protection, the sale and export of certain chemicals or hazardous materials, and various health and safety matters. The costs of complying with these laws and regulations can be significant and may increase as applicable requirements and their enforcement become more stringent and new rules are implemented. Adverse developments and/or periodic settlements could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a discussion of current environmental matters. Climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change, may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations. Climate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could present risks to our future operations from natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, wildfires or flooding. Such extreme weather conditions could pose physical risks to our facilities and disrupt operation of our supply chain and may increase operational costs. The impacts of climate change on global water resources may result in water scarcity, which could in the future impact our ability to access sufficient quantities of water in certain locations and result in increased costs. Concern over climate change continues to result in new legal or regulatory requirements designed to mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment, such as the EU's CSRD, California’s Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act and Climate Related Financial Risk Act, and similar regulations under consideration by the SEC. We are experiencing increased compliance burdens and costs to meet the regulatory obligations and these regulatory obligations may adversely affect raw material sourcing, manufacturing operations and the distribution of our products.        13     Table of Contents Our business exposes us to potential product liability, warranty, and tort claims, and recalls, which may negatively impact our operations, financial results, and reputation. The development, manufacture and sale of adhesives, sealants, and other specialty chemical products by us, including products produced for the medical device, automotive, food and beverage, aerospace and defense, construction, and hygiene products end markets, involves a risk of exposure to product liability, warranty, and tort claims, product recalls, product seizures and related adverse publicity. A product liability, warranty, or tort claim or judgment against us could also result in substantial and unexpected expenditures, affect customer confidence in our products, and divert management's attention from other responsibilities. Although we maintain product liability insurance, there can be no assurance that the level of coverage is adequate, that coverage will apply, or that we will be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all. We also have contracting policies and controls in place to limit our exposure to third party claims, though we might not always be able to limit our exposure to those claims. We have lawsuits and claims against us with uncertain outcomes. Our operations from time to time are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. The results of any future litigation or settlement of such lawsuits and claims are inherently unpredictable, but such outcomes could be adverse and material in amount. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a discussion of current litigation. The Company’s effective tax rate could be volatile and materially change as a result of the adoption of new tax legislation and other factors. A change in tax laws is one of many factors that impact the Company’s effective tax rate. The U.S. Congress and other government agencies in jurisdictions where the Company does business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. As a result, the tax laws in the U.S. and other countries in which the Company does business could change, and any such changes could adversely impact our effective tax rate, financial condition and results of operations. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (""OECD""), an international association of 38 countries including the United States, finalized and adopted numerous changes to long-standing tax principles. Certain of these changes become effective for the Company in 2025 and will likely increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes. Additional income tax expense or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a negative impact on our financial results.  We are subject to income tax laws and regulations in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. Our income tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Our income tax provision and income tax liabilities could be adversely affected by the jurisdictional mix of earnings, changes in valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and regulations. In the ordinary course of our business, we are also subject to continuous examinations of our income tax returns by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final results of any tax examination or related litigation could be materially different from our related historical income tax provisions and accruals. Adverse developments in an audit, examination or litigation related to previously filed tax returns, or in the relevant jurisdiction’s tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles and interpretations could have a material effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. The decision to repatriate foreign earnings could result in higher withholding taxes. Financial Risks We may be required to record impairment charges on our goodwill or long-lived assets.  Weak demand may cause underutilization of our manufacturing capacity or elimination of product lines; contract terminations or customer shutdowns may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment; or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific product or customer events may require us to record an impairment on tangible assets, such as facilities and equipment, as well as intangible assets, such as intellectual property or goodwill, which would have a negative impact on our financial results.        14     Table of Contents Our current indebtedness could have a negative impact on our liquidity or restrict our activities. Our current indebtedness contains various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. Our overall leverage and the terms of our financing arrangements could:   ●  limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity, particularly if any ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward;   ●  make it more difficult to satisfy our obligations under the terms of our indebtedness;   ●  limit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all;   ●  limit our flexibility to plan for and adjust to changing business and market conditions in the industries in which we operate and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;   ●  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to make interest and principal payments on our debt, thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future acquisitions, working capital, business activities and other general corporate requirements;   ●  subject us to higher levels of indebtedness than our competitors, which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce our flexibility in responding to increased competition; and   ●  expose us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates. This could negatively impact our earnings, cash flows and our ability to grow. For example, a one percentage point increase in the average interest rate on our floating rate debt at December 2, 2023 would increase future interest expense by approximately $5.3 million per year.  In addition, the restrictive covenants require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests will depend on our ongoing financial and operating performance, which, in turn, will be subject to economic conditions and to financial, market and competitive factors, many of which are beyond our control. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the instruments governing our indebtedness. "
3,FUL,FULLER (H. B.) CO,2023-01-24,"Risk Factors
  As a global manufacturer of adhesives, sealants and other specialty chemical products, we operate in a business environment that is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Below are the most significant factors that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Strategic and Operational Risks Our business and operations have been, and may in the future, be adversely affected by epidemics, pandemics, outbreaks of disease and other adverse public health developments, including COVID-19. Epidemics, pandemics, outbreaks of novel diseases and other adverse public health developments in countries and states where we operate may arise at any time. Such developments, including the COVID-19 pandemic, have had, and in the future may have, an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These effects include a potentially negative impact on the availability of our key personnel, labor shortages and increased turnover, temporary closures of our facilities or facilities of our business partners, customers, suppliers, third-party service providers or other vendors, and interruption of domestic and global supply chains, distribution channels and liquidity and capital or financial markets. In particular, restrictions on or disruptions of transportation, port closures or increased border controls or closures, or other impacts on domestic and global supply chains or distribution channels, could increase our costs for raw materials and commodity costs, increase demand for raw materials and commodities from competing purchasers, limit our ability to meet customer demand or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or cash flows. Precautionary measures that we may take in the future intended to limit the impact of any epidemic, pandemic, disease outbreak or other public health development, may result in additional costs. In addition, such epidemics, pandemics, disease outbreaks or other public health developments may adversely affect economies and financial markets throughout the world, such as the effect that COVID-19 has had on world economies and financial markets, which may affect our ability to obtain additional financing for our businesses and demand for our products and services. The extent to which COVID-19 or other pandemics will impact our business and our financial results in the future will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Such developments may include ongoing spread of the virus, disease severity, outbreak duration, extent of any reoccurrence of the coronavirus or any evolutions or mutations of the virus, and availability, administration and effectiveness of vaccines and development of therapeutic treatments that can restore consumer and business economic confidence. As a result, it is not possible to predict the overall future impact of COVID-19 on our business, liquidity, capital resources and financial results.        7     Table of Contents Increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials have adversely affected, and could continue to erode, our profit margins, and could negatively impact our operating results. In 2022, raw material costs made up approximately 75 percent of our cost of sales. Based on 2022 financial results, a hypothetical one percent change in our raw material costs would have resulted in a change in net income of approximately $15.7 million or $0.28 per diluted share.  Accordingly, changes in the cost of raw materials, due to scarcity, supplier disruptions, inflation and for other reasons, can significantly impact our earnings. Raw materials needed to manufacture products are obtained from a number of suppliers and many of the raw materials are petroleum and natural gas based derivatives. Under normal market conditions, these raw materials are generally available on the open market from a variety of producers. While alternate supplies of most key raw materials are available, supplier production outages may lead to strained supply-demand situations for certain raw materials. The substitution of key raw materials requires us to identify new supply sources, reformulate and re-test and may require seeking re-approval from our customers using those products. From time to time, the prices and availability of these raw materials may fluctuate, which could impair our ability to procure necessary materials, or increase the cost of manufacturing products. If the prices of raw materials increase in a short period of time, we may be unable to pass these increases on to our customers in a timely manner and could experience reductions to our profit margins. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on raw material prices, which could continue in the future. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic and responses to it have significantly limited or prevented the movement of goods and services worldwide, which has resulted in and could continue to result in disruptions in our supply chain and our difficulty in procuring or inability to procure raw materials necessary for the manufacturing of our products. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and responses to it has increased and could continue to increase the costs of making and distributing our products or result in delays in delivering, or an inability to deliver, them to our customers. We experience substantial competition in each of the operating segments and geographic areas in which we operate.  Our wide variety of products are sold in numerous markets, each of which is highly competitive. Our competitive position in markets is, in part, subject to external factors. For example, supply and demand for certain of our products is driven by end-use markets and worldwide capacities which, in turn, impact demand for and pricing of our products. Many of our direct competitors are part of large multinational companies and may have more resources than we do. Any increase in competition may result in lost market share or reduced prices, which could result in reduced profit margins. This may impair the ability to grow or even to maintain current levels of revenues and earnings. While we have an extensive customer base, loss of certain top customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations until such business is replaced, and no assurances can be made that we would be able to regain or replace any lost customers. Failure to develop new products and protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our future performance and growth.  Ongoing innovation and product development are important factors in our competitiveness. Failure to create new products and generate new ideas could negatively impact our ability to grow and deliver strong financial results. We continually apply for and obtain U.S. and foreign patents to protect the results of our research for use in our operations and licensing. We are party to a number of patent licenses and other technology agreements. We rely on patents, confidentiality agreements and internal security measures to protect our intellectual property. Failure to protect this intellectual property could negatively affect our future performance and growth. Our operations may present health and safety risks. Notwithstanding our emphasis on the safety of our employees and contractors and the precautions we take related to health and safety, we may be unable to avoid safety incidents relating to our operations that result in injuries or deaths. Certain safety incidents may result in legal or regulatory action that could result in increased expenses or reputational damage. We maintain workers' compensation insurance to address the risk of incurring material liabilities for injuries or deaths, but there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage will be adequate or will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could result in material liabilities to us for any injuries or deaths. Changes to federal, state and local employee health and safety regulations, and legislative, regulatory or societal responses to safety incidents may result in heightened regulations or public scrutiny that may increase our compliance costs or result in reputational damage. A failure in our information technology systems could negatively impact our business.  We rely on information technology to record and process transactions, manage our business and maintain the financial accuracy of our records. Our computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from various sources, including power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, vandalism, catastrophic events and human error. Interruptions of our computer systems could disrupt our business, for example by leading to plant downtime and/or power outages, and could result in the loss of business and cause us to incur additional expense. We are in the process of implementing a global Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system that we refer to as Project ONE, which will upgrade and standardize our information system. Implementation of Project ONE began in our North America adhesives business in 2014 and, through 2022, we completed implementation of this system in various parts of our business including Latin America (except Brazil), Australia and various other businesses in North America and EIMEA. During 2023 and beyond, we will continue implementation in North America, EIMEA and Asia Pacific. Any delays or other failure to achieve our implementation goals may adversely impact our financial results. In addition, the failure to either deliver the application on time or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs could lead to business disruption and loss of business. Failure or abandonment of any part of the ERP system could result in a write-off of part or all of the costs that have been capitalized on the project. We are at risk of cyber-attacks or other security breaches that could compromise sensitive business information, undermine our ability to operate effectively and expose us to liability, which could cause our business and reputation to suffer. Increasingly, companies are subject to a wide variety of attacks on their networks on an ongoing basis. In addition to traditional computer “hackers,” malicious code (such as viruses and worms), phishing attempts, employee theft or misuse, and denial of service attacks, sophisticated nation-state and nation-state supported actors engage in intrusions and attacks (including advanced persistent threat intrusions) and add to the risks to internal networks, cloud deployed enterprise and customer-facing environments and the information they store and process. Despite significant efforts to create security barriers to such threats, it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate these risks. We, and our third-party software and service providers, may face security threats and attacks from a variety of sources.         8     Table of Contents As part of our business, we store our data, including intellectual property, and certain data about our employees, customers and vendors in our information technology systems. Our security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise. Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, or other information to gain access to our customers' data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems. In addition, given their size and complexity, our information systems could be vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, third-party vendors and/or business partners, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties attempting to gain unauthorized access to our products, systems or confidential information.  If a third party gained unauthorized access to our data, including any data regarding our employees, customers or vendors, the security breach could expose us to risks. Such unauthorized access and a failure to effectively recover from breaches could compromise confidential information, disrupt our business, harm our reputation, result in the loss of customer confidence, business and assets (including trade secrets and other intellectual property), result in regulatory proceedings and legal claims, and have a negative impact on our financial results. Risks associated with acquisitions could have an adverse effect on us and the inability to execute organizational restructuring may affect our results. As part of our growth strategy, from time to time, we have made acquisitions of complementary businesses or products. The ability to grow through acquisitions depends upon our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate suitable acquisitions. If we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing business, our results of operations and our cash flows could be adversely affected. Our acquisition strategy also involves other risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return on capital, unidentified issues not discovered in our investigations and evaluations of those strategies and acquisitions, and difficulties implementing and maintaining consistent standards, controls, procedures, policies and systems. Future acquisitions could result in additional debt and other liabilities, and increased interest expense, restructuring charges and amortization expense related to intangible assets. Our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the United States, where there is the potential for significant economic and political disruptions. Our operations in these markets may be subject to greater risks than those faced by our operations in the United States, including political and economic instability, project delay or abandonment due to unanticipated government actions, inadequate investment in infrastructure, undeveloped property rights and legal systems, unfamiliar regulatory environments, relationships with local partners, language and cultural differences and increased difficulty recruiting, training and retaining qualified employees. In addition, our profitability is dependent on our ability to drive sustainable productivity improvements such as cost savings through organizational restructuring. Delays or unexpected costs may prevent us from realizing the full operational and financial benefits of such restructuring initiatives and may potentially disrupt our operations. Legal and Regulatory Risks The impact of changing laws or regulations or the manner of interpretation or enforcement of existing laws or regulations could adversely impact our financial performance and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase our cost of doing business and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. In addition, compliance with laws and regulations is complicated by our substantial global footprint, which will require significant and additional resources to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the various countries where we conduct business. Our global operations expose us to trade and economic sanctions and other restrictions imposed by the U.S., the EU and other governments and organizations. The U.S. Departments of Justice, Commerce, State, Homeland Security, and Treasury and other federal agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals for violations of economic sanctions laws, export control laws, the FCPA and other federal statutes and regulations, including those established by the OFAC. Under these laws and regulations, as well as other anti-corruption laws, anti-money-laundering laws, export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations, various government agencies may require export licenses, may seek to impose modifications to business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned persons or entities and modifications to compliance programs, including import restrictions, which may increase compliance costs, and may subject us to fines, penalties and other sanctions. A violation of these laws, regulations, policies or procedures could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we have implemented policies and procedures in these areas, we cannot assure that our policies and procedures are sufficient or that directors, officers, employees, representatives, manufacturers, suppliers and agents have not engaged and will not engage in conduct in violation of such policies and procedures. Costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental laws and regulations may negatively impact our operations and financial results.   We are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that impose various environmental controls on us or otherwise relate to environmental protection, the sale and export of certain chemicals or hazardous materials, and various health and safety matters. The costs of complying with these laws and regulations can be significant and may increase as applicable requirements and their enforcement become more stringent and new rules are implemented. Adverse developments and/or periodic settlements could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a discussion of current environmental matters.        9     Table of Contents Climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change, may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations. Climate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could present risks to our future operations from natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, wildfires or flooding. Such extreme weather conditions could pose physical risks to our facilities and disrupt operation of our supply chain and may increase operational costs. The impacts of climate change on global water resources may result in water scarcity, which could in the future impact our ability to access sufficient quantities of water in certain locations and result in increased costs. Concern over climate change could result in new legal or regulatory requirements designed to mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. If such laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory requirements, we may experience increased compliance burdens and costs to meet the regulatory obligations and may adversely affect raw material sourcing, manufacturing operations and the distribution of our products.  We have lawsuits and claims against us with uncertain outcomes. Our operations from time to time are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. The results of any future litigation or settlement of such lawsuits and claims are inherently unpredictable, but such outcomes could be adverse and material in amount. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a discussion of current litigation. The Company’s effective tax rate could be volatile and materially change as a result of the adoption of new tax legislation and other factors. A change in tax laws is one of many factors that impact the Company’s effective tax rate. The U.S. Congress and other government agencies in jurisdictions where the Company does business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. As a result, the tax laws in the U.S. and other countries in which the Company does business could change, and any such changes could adversely impact our effective tax rate, financial condition and results of operations. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (""OECD""), an international association of 38 countries including the United States, has proposed changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. These proposals, if finalized and adopted by the associated countries, will likely increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes. The current U.S. presidential administration could enact changes in tax laws that could negatively impact the Company’s effective tax rate. Prior to the U.S. presidential election, President Biden proposed an increase in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 21% to 28%, doubling the rate of tax on certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries, the creation of a 10% penalty on certain imports and a 15% minimum tax on worldwide book income. Additionally, the proposed changes include significant provisions related to the deductibility of interest. If any or all of these (or similar) proposals are ultimately enacted into law, in whole or in part, they could have a negative impact to the Company’s effective tax rate. Additional income tax expense or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a negative impact on our financial results.  We are subject to income tax laws and regulations in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. Our income tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Our income tax provision and income tax liabilities could be adversely affected by the jurisdictional mix of earnings, changes in valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and regulations. In the ordinary course of our business, we are also subject to continuous examinations of our income tax returns by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final results of any tax examination or related litigation could be materially different from our related historical income tax provisions and accruals. Adverse developments in an audit, examination or litigation related to previously filed tax returns, or in the relevant jurisdiction’s tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles and interpretations could have a material effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. Financial Risks We may be required to record impairment charges on our goodwill or long-lived assets.  Weak demand may cause underutilization of our manufacturing capacity or elimination of product lines; contract terminations or customer shutdowns may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment; or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific product or customer events may require us to record an impairment on tangible assets, such as facilities and equipment, as well as intangible assets, such as intellectual property or goodwill, which would have a negative impact on our financial results. Our current indebtedness could have a negative impact on our liquidity or restrict our activities. Our current indebtedness contains various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. Our overall leverage and the terms of our financing arrangements could:   ●  limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions;   ●  make it more difficult to satisfy our obligations under the terms of our indebtedness;   ●  limit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all;   ●  limit our flexibility to plan for and adjust to changing business and market conditions in the industries in which we operate and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;   ●  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to make interest and principal payments on our debt, thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future acquisitions, working capital, business activities and other general corporate requirements;   ●  limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, to fund growth or for general corporate purposes, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity, particularly if any ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward; and   ●  subject us to higher levels of indebtedness than our competitors, which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce our flexibility in responding to increased competition.         10     Table of Contents In addition, the restrictive covenants require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests will depend on our ongoing financial and operating performance, which, in turn, will be subject to economic conditions and to financial, market and competitive factors, many of which are beyond our control. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the instruments governing our indebtedness. The interest rates of our term loans are priced using a spread over LIBOR. LIBOR, the London Interbank Offered Rate, is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. We typically use LIBOR as a reference rate or index in our term loans such that the interest due to our creditors pursuant to a term loan extended to us is calculated using LIBOR. Most of our term loan agreements contain a stated minimum value for LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the entity that calculates LIBOR, announced that LIBOR was to be phased out by the end of 2021. Subsequently, on March 5, 2021, LIBOR’s administrator announced that publication of overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and 12-month U.S. dollar LIBOR would cease immediately following publication of such interest rates on June 30, 2023, and that publication of all other currency and tenor variants would cease immediately following publication on December 31, 2021. In December 2022, the FASB released an exposure draft that proposes deferring the sunset date of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) Topic 848, Reference Rate Reform, which provides optional relief for contract modifications that are related to reference rate reform, from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024.  The U.S. Federal Reserve has selected the Secured Overnight Funding Rate (""SOFR"") as the preferred alternate rate to LIBOR. We are planning for this transition and will amend any agreements to accommodate the SOFR rate where required. While our term loan is calculated using LIBOR as its underlying rate, our revolver has transitioned to now using SOFR as its underlying rate. We continue to evaluate the potential impact of the transition to the SOFR rate, which remains subject to uncertainty. MacroeconomicRisks Uncertainties in foreign economic, political, regulatory and social conditions and fluctuations in foreign currency may adversely affect our results.  Approximately 55 percent, or $2.1 billion, of our net revenue was generated outside the United States in 2022. International operations could be adversely affected by changes in economic, political, regulatory, and social conditions, especially in Brazil, Russia, China, the Middle East, including Turkey and Egypt, and other developing or emerging markets where we do business. An economic downturn in the businesses or geographic areas in which we sell our products could reduce demand for these products and result in a decrease in sales volume that could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Product demand often depends on end-use markets. Economic conditions that reduce consumer confidence or discretionary spending may reduce product demand. Challenging economic conditions may also impair the ability of our customers to pay for products they have purchased, and as a result, our reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. In addition, trade protection measures, anti-bribery and anti-corruption regulations, restrictions on repatriation of earnings, differing intellectual property rights and changes in legal and regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs could adversely affect our results of operations. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could potentially result in increases or decreases in net revenue, cost of raw materials and earnings and may adversely affect the value of our assets outside the United States. In 2022, the change in foreign currencies negatively impacted our net revenue by approximately $191.7 million. In 2022, we spent approximately $2.2 billion for raw materials worldwide of which approximately $1.2 billion was purchased outside the United States. Based on 2022 financial results, a hypothetical one percent change in our cost of sales due to foreign currency rate changes would have resulted in a change in net income of approximately $10.5 million or $0.19 per diluted share. Although we utilize risk management tools, including hedging, as appropriate, to mitigate market fluctuations in foreign currencies, any changes in strategy in regard to risk management tools can also affect revenue, expenses and results of operations and there can be no assurance that such measures will result in cost savings or that all market fluctuation exposure will be eliminated. Distressed financial markets may result in dramatic deflation of financial asset valuations and a general disruption in capital markets.   Adverse equity market conditions and volatility in the credit markets could have a negative impact on the value of our pension trust assets, our future estimated pension liabilities and other postretirement benefit plans. In addition, we could be required to provide increased pension plan funding. As a result, our financial results could be negatively impacted. Reduced access to capital markets may affect our ability to invest in strategic growth initiatives such as acquisitions. In addition, the reduced credit availability could limit our customers’ ability to invest in their businesses, refinance maturing debt obligations, or meet their ongoing working capital needs. If these customers do not have sufficient access to the financial markets, demand for our products may decline. The military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the global response to it, could adversely impact our revenues, gross margins and financial results. The U.S. government and other nations have imposed significant restrictions on most companies’ ability to do business in Russia as a result of the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Increases in energy demand and supply disruptions caused by the Russia and Ukraine conflict have resulted in significantly higher energy prices, particularly in Europe. It is not possible to predict the broader or longer-term consequences of this conflict, which could include further sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, energy shortages, geopolitical shifts and adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, security conditions, currency exchange rates and financial markets. Such geo-political instability and uncertainty could have a negative impact on our ability to sell to, ship products to, collect payments from, and support customers in certain regions based on trade restrictions, embargoes and export control law restrictions, and logistics restrictions including closures of air space, and could increase the costs, risks and adverse impacts from these new challenges. We may also be the subject of increased cyber-attacks.  While Russia does not constitute a material portion of our business, a significant escalation or expansion of economic disruption or the conflict's current scope could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Catastrophic events could disrupt our operations or the operations of our suppliers or customers, having a negative impact on our financial results. Unexpected events, including global pandemics, natural disasters and severe weather events, fires or explosions at our facilities or those of our suppliers, acts of war or terrorism, supply disruptions or breaches of security of our information technology systems could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm our operations, our customers and our suppliers. Such events could reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers and deliver products to our customers.        11     Table of Contents "
10,FUL,FULLER (H. B.) CO,2022-01-25,"Risk Factors
 As a global manufacturer of adhesives, sealants and other specialty chemical products, we operate in a business environment that is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Below are the most significant factors that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Strategic and Operational Risks The COVID-19 pandemic has affected and will continue to affect our operations and financial results. In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, which became a global pandemic. Throughout fiscal year 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to have a significant disruptive impact on global economies, supply chains and industrial production. We have effectively managed our global operations throughout the pandemic, implementing rigorous protocols focused on the health and safety of our employees and ensuring business continuity across our supplier, manufacturing and distribution networks. These actions enabled us to meet our customers’ increased demands for adhesive solutions, effectively allocate our resources and manage expenses, and deliver strong financial results, while maintaining a safe workplace for employees. Concerns remain that there could be a prolonged resurgence of cases triggering additional government mandated lockdowns or similar restrictions, for example due to the emergence of new variants against which existing vaccines are not as effective or which may be more easily transmitted. Due to the evolving and highly uncertain nature of the pandemic, it is currently not possible to estimate any additional direct or indirect impacts this outbreak may have on our business. Any disruption of the manufacturing of our products, commerce and related activity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, including ongoing labor shortages and supply chain constraints, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials have adversely affected, and could continue to erode, our profit margins, and could negatively impact our operating results. In 2021, raw material costs made up approximately 75 percent of our cost of sales. Based on 2021 financial results, a hypothetical one percent change in our raw material costs would have resulted in a change in net income of approximately $13.2 million or $0.24 per diluted share.  Accordingly, changes in the cost of raw materials, due to scarcity, supplier disruptions, inflation and for other reasons, can significantly impact our earnings. Raw materials needed to manufacture products are obtained from a number of suppliers and many of the raw materials are petroleum and natural gas based derivatives. Under normal market conditions, these raw materials are generally available on the open market from a variety of producers. While alternate supplies of most key raw materials are available, supplier production outages may lead to strained supply-demand situations for certain raw materials. The substitution of key raw materials requires us to identify new supply sources, reformulate and re-test and may require seeking re-approval from our customers using those products. From time to time, the prices and availability of these raw materials may fluctuate, which could impair our ability to procure necessary materials, or increase the cost of manufacturing products. If the prices of raw materials increase in a short period of time, we may be unable to pass these increases on to our customers in a timely manner and could experience reductions to our profit margins. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on raw material prices, which could continue in the future. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic and responses to it have significantly limited or prevented the movement of goods and services worldwide, which has resulted in and could continue to result in disruptions in our supply chain and our difficulty in procuring or inability to procure raw materials necessary for the manufacturing of our products. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and responses to it has increased and could continue to increase the costs of making and distributing our products or result in delays in delivering, or an inability to deliver, them to our customers. We experience substantial competition in each of the operating segments and geographic areas in which we operate.  Our wide variety of products are sold in numerous markets, each of which is highly competitive. Our competitive position in markets is, in part, subject to external factors. For example, supply and demand for certain of our products is driven by end-use markets and worldwide capacities which, in turn, impact demand for and pricing of our products. Many of our direct competitors are part of large multinational companies and may have more resources than we do. Any increase in competition may result in lost market share or reduced prices, which could result in reduced profit margins. This may impair the ability to grow or even to maintain current levels of revenues and earnings. While we have an extensive customer base, loss of certain top customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations until such business is replaced, and no assurances can be made that we would be able to regain or replace any lost customers.        6     Table of Contents Failure to develop new products and protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our future performance and growth.  Ongoing innovation and product development are important factors in our competitiveness. Failure to create new products and generate new ideas could negatively impact our ability to grow and deliver strong financial results. We continually apply for and obtain U.S. and foreign patents to protect the results of our research for use in our operations and licensing. We are party to a number of patent licenses and other technology agreements. We rely on patents, confidentiality agreements and internal security measures to protect our intellectual property. Failure to protect this intellectual property could negatively affect our future performance and growth. A failure in our information technology systems could negatively impact our business.  We rely on information technology to record and process transactions, manage our business and maintain the financial accuracy of our records. Our computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from various sources, including power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, vandalism, catastrophic events and human error. Interruptions of our computer systems could disrupt our business, for example by leading to plant downtime and/or power outages, and could result in the loss of business and cause us to incur additional expense. Information technology security threats are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Our information technology systems could be breached by unauthorized outside parties or misused by employees or other insiders intent on extracting sensitive information, corrupting information or disrupting business processes. Such unauthorized access and a failure to effectively recover from breaches could compromise confidential information, disrupt our business, harm our reputation, result in the loss of assets including trade secrets and other intellectual property, customer confidence and business, result in regulatory proceedings and legal claims, and have a negative impact on our financial results. We are in the process of implementing a global Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system that we refer to as Project ONE, which will upgrade and standardize our information system. Implementation of Project ONE began in our North America adhesives business in 2014 and, through 2021, we completed implementation of this system in various parts of our business including Latin America (except Brazil), Australia and various other businesses in North America and EIMEA. During 2022 and beyond, we will continue implementation in North America, EIMEA and Asia Pacific. Any delays or other failure to achieve our implementation goals may adversely impact our financial results. In addition, the failure to either deliver the application on time or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs could lead to business disruption and loss of business. Failure or abandonment of any part of the ERP system could result in a write-off of part or all of the costs that have been capitalized on the project. Risks associated with acquisitions could have an adverse effect on us and the inability to execute organizational restructuring may affect our results. As part of our growth strategy, from time to time, we have made acquisitions of complementary businesses or products. The ability to grow through acquisitions depends upon our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate suitable acquisitions. If we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing business, our results of operations and our cash flows could be adversely affected. Our acquisition strategy also involves other risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return on capital, unidentified issues not discovered in our investigations and evaluations of those strategies and acquisitions, and difficulties implementing and maintaining consistent standards, controls, procedures, policies and systems. Future acquisitions could result in additional debt and other liabilities, and increased interest expense, restructuring charges and amortization expense related to intangible assets. In addition, our profitability is dependent on our ability to drive sustainable productivity improvements such as cost savings through organizational restructuring. Delays or unexpected costs may prevent us from realizing the full operational and financial benefits of such restructuring initiatives and may potentially disrupt our operations. Legal and Regulatory Risks The impact of changing laws or regulations or the manner of interpretation or enforcement of existing laws or regulations could adversely impact our financial performance and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase our cost of doing business and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. In addition, compliance with laws and regulations is complicated by our substantial global footprint, which will require significant and additional resources to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the various countries where we conduct business. Our global operations expose us to trade and economic sanctions and other restrictions imposed by the U.S., the EU and other governments and organizations.

Under these laws and regulations, as well as other anti-corruption laws, anti-money-laundering laws, export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations, various government agencies may require export licenses, may seek to impose modifications to business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned persons or entities and modifications to compliance programs, which may increase compliance costs, and may subject us to fines, penalties and other sanctions. A violation of these laws, regulations, policies or procedures could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we have implemented policies and procedures in these areas, we cannot assure that our policies and procedures are sufficient or that directors, officers, employees, representatives, manufacturers, suppliers and agents have not engaged and will not engage in conduct in violation of such policies and procedures. Costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental laws and regulations may negatively impact our operations and financial results.   We are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that impose various environmental controls on us or otherwise relate to environmental protection, the sale and export of certain chemicals or hazardous materials, and various health and safety matters.

Our overall leverage and the terms of our financing arrangements could:   ●  limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions;   ●  make it more difficult to satisfy our obligations under the terms of our indebtedness;   ●  limit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all;   ●  limit our flexibility to plan for and adjust to changing business and market conditions in the industries in which we operate and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;   ●  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to make interest and principal payments on our debt, thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future acquisitions, working capital, business activities, and other general corporate requirements;   ●  limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, to fund growth or for general corporate purposes, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity, particularly if any ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward; and   ●  subject us to higher levels of indebtedness than our competitors, which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce our flexibility in responding to increased competition.         8     Table of Contents In addition, the restrictive covenants require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests will depend on our ongoing financial and operating performance, which, in turn, will be subject to economic conditions and to financial, market and competitive factors, many of which are beyond our control. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the instruments governing our indebtedness. The interest rates of our term loans are priced using a spread over LIBOR. LIBOR, the London Interbank Offered Rate, is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. We typically use LIBOR as a reference rate or index in our term loans such that the interest due to our creditors pursuant to a term loan extended to us is calculated using LIBOR. Most of our term loan agreements contain a stated minimum value for LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the entity that calculates LIBOR, announced that LIBOR should be phased out by the end of 2021. Subsequently, on March 5, 2021, LIBOR’s administrator announced that publication of overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and 12-month U.S. dollar LIBOR would cease immediately following publication of such interest rates on June 30, 2023, and that publication of all other currency and tenor variants would cease immediately following publication on December 31, 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions and other market participants, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities (“SOFR”). Whether or not SOFR attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question. SOFR is observed and backward looking, which stands in contrast with LIBOR under the current methodology, which can be an estimated forward-looking rate and relies, to some degree, on the expert judgment of submitting panel members. Given that SOFR is a secured rate backed by government securities, it will be a rate that does not take into account bank credit risk (as is the case with LIBOR). The SOFR rate is therefore likely to be lower than LIBOR rates and is less likely to correlate with the funding costs of financial institutions. If LIBOR ceases to exist prior to the maturity of our contracts, we will be required to substitute an index such as the Prime Rate or renegotiate our credit agreements that utilize LIBOR as the reference rate, and substitute an index to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established. If we borrow under the Prime Rate, we will see increased borrowing costs until the agreements are amended or renegotiated to incorporate the new SOFR borrowing rate or another substitute index. MacroeconomicRisks Uncertainties in foreign economic, political, regulatory and social conditions and fluctuations in foreign currency may adversely affect our results.  Approximately 57 percent, or $1.9 billion, of our net revenue was generated outside the United States in 2021. International operations could be adversely affected by changes in economic, political, regulatory, and social conditions, especially in Brazil, Russia, China, the Middle East, including Turkey and Egypt, and other developing or emerging markets where we do business. An economic downturn in the businesses or geographic areas in which we sell our products could reduce demand for these products and result in a decrease in sales volume that could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Product demand often depends on end-use markets. Economic conditions that reduce consumer confidence or discretionary spending may reduce product demand. Challenging economic conditions may also impair the ability of our customers to pay for products they have purchased, and as a result, our reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. In addition, trade protection measures, anti-bribery and anti-corruption regulations, restrictions on repatriation of earnings, differing intellectual property rights and changes in legal and regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs could adversely affect our results of operations. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could potentially result in increases or decreases in net revenue, cost of raw materials and earnings and may adversely affect the value of our assets outside the United States. In 2021, the change in foreign currencies positively impacted our net revenue by approximately $64.0 million. In 2021, we spent approximately $1.8 billion for raw materials worldwide of which approximately $996.7 million was purchased outside the United States. Based on 2021 financial results, a hypothetical one percent change in our cost of sales due to foreign currency rate changes would have resulted in a change in net income of approximately $9.4 million or $0.17 per diluted share. Although we utilize risk management tools, including hedging, as appropriate, to mitigate market fluctuations in foreign currencies, any changes in strategy in regard to risk management tools can also affect revenue, expenses and results of operations and there can be no assurance that such measures will result in cost savings or that all market fluctuation exposure will be eliminated. Distressed financial markets may result in dramatic deflation of financial asset valuations and a general disruption in capital markets.   Adverse equity market conditions and volatility in the credit markets could have a negative impact on the value of our pension trust assets, our future estimated pension liabilities and other postretirement benefit plans. In addition, we could be required to provide increased pension plan funding. As a result, our financial results could be negatively impacted. Reduced access to capital markets may affect our ability to invest in strategic growth initiatives such as acquisitions. In addition, the reduced credit availability could limit our customers’ ability to invest in their businesses, refinance maturing debt obligations, or meet their ongoing working capital needs. If these customers do not have sufficient access to the financial markets, demand for our products may decline. Catastrophic events could disrupt our operations or the operations of our suppliers or customers, having a negative impact on our financial results. Unexpected events, including global pandemics, natural disasters and severe weather events, fires or explosions at our facilities or those of our suppliers, acts of war or terrorism, supply disruptions or breaches of security of our information technology systems could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm our operations, our customers and our suppliers. Such events could reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers and deliver products to our customers. "
0,FUL,FULLER (H. B.) CO,2021-01-26,"Risk Factors
 As a global manufacturer of adhesives, sealants and other specialty chemical products, we operate in a business environment that is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Below are the most significant factors that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Strategic and Operational Risks The COVID-19 pandemic has affected and will continue to affect our operations and financial results. In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, which became a global pandemic. Throughout fiscal year 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant disruptive impact on global economies, supply chains and industrial production, which resulted in reduced demand in some markets, while at the same time driving elevated demand for adhesive solutions for paper products, food and e-commerce packaging, and hygiene and medical goods. We effectively managed our global operations throughout the pandemic, implementing rigorous protocols focused on the health and safety of our employees and ensuring business continuity across our supplier, manufacturing and distribution networks. These actions enabled us to meet our customers’ increased demands for adhesive solutions for essential goods, effectively allocate our resources and manage expenses, and deliver strong financial results, while maintaining a safe workplace for employees. However, due to the evolving and highly uncertain nature of this event, it is currently not possible to estimate any additional direct or indirect impacts this outbreak may have on our business. Any disruption of the manufacturing of our products, commerce and related activity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results.  In 2020, raw material costs made up approximately 75 percent of our cost of sales. Accordingly, changes in the cost of raw materials can significantly impact our earnings. Raw materials needed to manufacture products are obtained from a number of suppliers and many of the raw materials are petroleum and natural gas based derivatives. Under normal market conditions, these raw materials are generally available on the open market from a variety of producers. While alternate supplies of most key raw materials are available, supplier production outages may lead to strained supply-demand situations for certain raw materials. The substitution of key raw materials requires us to identify new supply sources, reformulate and re-test and may require seeking re-approval from our customers using those products. From time to time, the prices and availability of these raw materials may fluctuate, which could impair our ability to procure necessary materials, or increase the cost of manufacturing products. If the prices of raw materials increase in a short period of time, we may be unable to pass these increases on to our customers in a timely manner and could experience reductions to our profit margins. Based on 2020 financial results, a hypothetical one percent change in our raw material costs would have resulted in a change in net income of approximately $11.0 million or $0.21 per diluted share.        7     Table of Contents We experience substantial competition in each of the operating segments and geographic areas in which we operate.  Our wide variety of products are sold in numerous markets, each of which is highly competitive. Our competitive position in markets is, in part, subject to external factors. For example, supply and demand for certain of our products is driven by end-use markets and worldwide capacities which, in turn, impact demand for and pricing of our products. Many of our direct competitors are part of large multinational companies and may have more resources than we do. Any increase in competition may result in lost market share or reduced prices, which could result in reduced profit margins. This may impair the ability to grow or even to maintain current levels of revenues and earnings. While we have an extensive customer base, loss of certain top customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations until such business is replaced, and no assurances can be made that we would be able to regain or replace any lost customers. Failure to develop new products and protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our future performance and growth.  Ongoing innovation and product development are important factors in our competitiveness. Failure to create new products and generate new ideas could negatively impact our ability to grow and deliver strong financial results. We continually apply for and obtain U.S. and foreign patents to protect the results of our research for use in our operations and licensing. We are party to a number of patent licenses and other technology agreements. We rely on patents, confidentiality agreements and internal security measures to protect our intellectual property. Failure to protect this intellectual property could negatively affect our future performance and growth. A failure in our information technology systems could negatively impact our business.  We rely on information technology to record and process transactions, manage our business and maintain the financial accuracy of our records. Our computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from various sources, including power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, vandalism, catastrophic events and human error. Interruptions of our computer systems could disrupt our business, for example by leading to plant downtime and/or power outages, and could result in the loss of business and cause us to incur additional expense. Information technology security threats are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Our information technology systems could be breached by unauthorized outside parties or misused by employees or other insiders intent on extracting sensitive information, corrupting information or disrupting business processes. Such unauthorized access and a failure to effectively recover from breaches could compromise confidential information, disrupt our business, harm our reputation, result in the loss of assets including trade secrets and other intellectual property, customer confidence and business, result in regulatory proceedings and legal claims, and have a negative impact on our financial results.        8     Table of Contents We are in the process of implementing a global Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system that we refer to as Project ONE, which will upgrade and standardize our information system. Implementation of Project ONE began in our North America adhesives business in 2014 and, through 2020, we completed implementation of this system in various parts of our business including Latin America (except Brazil), Australia and various other businesses in North America. During 2021 and beyond, we will continue implementation in North America, EIMEA and Asia Pacific. Any delays or other failure to achieve our implementation goals may adversely impact our financial results. In addition, the failure to either deliver the application on time or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs could lead to business disruption and loss of business. Failure or abandonment of any part of the ERP system could result in a write-off of part or all of the costs that have been capitalized on the project. Risks associated with acquisitions could have an adverse effect on us and the inability to execute organizational restructuring may affect our results. As part of our growth strategy, from time to time, we have made acquisitions of complementary businesses or products. The ability to grow through acquisitions depends upon our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate suitable acquisitions. If we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing business, our results of operations and our cash flows could be adversely affected. Our acquisition strategy also involves other risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return on capital, unidentified issues not discovered in our investigations and evaluations of those strategies and acquisitions, and difficulties implementing and maintaining consistent standards, controls, procedures, policies and systems. Future acquisitions could result in additional debt and other liabilities, and increased interest expense, restructuring charges and amortization expense related to intangible assets. In addition, our profitability is dependent on our ability to drive sustainable productivity improvements such as cost savings through organizational restructuring. Delays or unexpected costs may prevent us from realizing the full operational and financial benefits of such restructuring initiatives and may potentially disrupt our operations. Legal and Regulatory Risks The impact of changing laws or regulations or the manner of interpretation or enforcement of existing laws or regulations could adversely impact our financial performance and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase our cost of doing business and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. In addition, compliance with laws and regulations is complicated by our substantial global footprint, which will require significant and additional resources to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the various countries where we conduct business. Our global operations expose us to trade and economic sanctions and other restrictions imposed by the U.S., the EU and other governments and organizations. The U.S. Departments of Justice, Commerce, State and Treasury and other federal agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals for violations of economic sanctions laws, export control laws, the FCPA and other federal statutes and regulations, including those established by the OFAC. Under these laws and regulations, as well as other anti-corruption laws, anti-money-laundering laws, export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations, various government agencies may require export licenses, may seek to impose modifications to business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned persons or entities and modifications to compliance programs, which may increase compliance costs, and may subject us to fines, penalties and other sanctions. A violation of these laws, regulations, policies or procedures could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we have implemented policies and procedures in these areas, we cannot assure that our policies and procedures are sufficient or that directors, officers, employees, representatives, manufacturers, suppliers and agents have not engaged and will not engage in conduct in violation of such policies and procedures. Costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental laws and regulations may negatively impact our operations and financial results.   We are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that impose various environmental controls on us or otherwise relate to environmental protection, the sale and export of certain chemicals or hazardous materials, and various health and safety matters. The costs of complying with these laws and regulations can be significant and may increase as applicable requirements and their enforcement become more stringent and new rules are implemented. Adverse developments and/or periodic settlements could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a discussion of current environmental matters.  We have lawsuits and claims against us with uncertain outcomes. Our operations from time to time are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. The results of any future litigation or settlement of such lawsuits and claims are inherently unpredictable, but such outcomes could be adverse and material in amount. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a discussion of current litigation.        9     Table of Contents The Company’s effective tax rate could be volatile and materially change as a result of the adoption of new tax legislation and other factors. A change in tax laws is one of many factors that impact the Company’s effective tax rate. The U.S. Congress and other government agencies in jurisdictions where the Company does business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations.  As a result, the tax laws in the U.S. and other countries in which the Company does business could change, and any such changes could adversely impact our effective tax rate, financial condition and results of operations. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association of 34 countries including the United States, has proposed changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. These proposals, if finalized and adopted by the associated countries, will likely increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes. On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law H.R. 1, originally known as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act”, hereafter referred to as “U.S. Tax Reform”. Since the passing of U.S. Tax Reform, additional guidance in the form of notices and proposed regulations which interpret various aspects of U.S. Tax Reform have been issued.  Changes could be made to the proposed regulations as they become finalized, future legislation could be enacted, more regulations and notices could be issued, all of which may impact our financial results. We will continue to monitor all of these changes and will reflect the impact as appropriate in future financial statements. Many state and local tax jurisdictions are still determining how they will interpret elements of U.S. Tax Reform. Final state and local governments’ conformity, legislation and guidance relating to U.S. Tax Reform may impact our financial results. The results of the U.S. presidential election could lead to changes in tax laws that could negatively impact the Company’s effective tax rate. Prior to the U.S. presidential election, President Biden proposed an increase in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 21% to 28%, doubling the rate of tax on certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries, the creation of a 10% penalty on certain imports and a 15% minimum tax on worldwide book income. If any or all of these (or similar) proposals are ultimately enacted into law, in whole or in part, they could have a negative impact to the Company’s effective tax rate. Additional income tax expense or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a negative impact on our financial results.  We are subject to income tax laws and regulations in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions.  Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes.  Our income tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions.  Our income tax provision and income tax liabilities could be adversely affected by the jurisdictional mix of earnings, changes in valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and regulations. In the ordinary course of our business, we are also subject to continuous examinations of our income tax returns by tax authorities.  Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final results of any tax examination or related litigation could be materially different from our related historical income tax provisions and accruals. Adverse developments in an audit, examination or litigation related to previously filed tax returns, or in the relevant jurisdiction’s tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles and interpretations could have a material effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. Financial Risks We may be required to record impairment charges on our goodwill or long-lived assets.  Weak demand may cause underutilization of our manufacturing capacity or elimination of product lines; contract terminations or customer shutdowns may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment; or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific product or customer events may require us to record an impairment on tangible assets, such as facilities and equipment, as well as intangible assets, such as intellectual property or goodwill, which would have a negative impact on our financial results.        10     Table of Contents Our current indebtedness could have a negative impact on our liquidity or restrict our activities. Our current indebtedness contains various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. Our overall leverage and the terms of our financing arrangements could:   ●  limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions;   ●  make it more difficult to satisfy our obligations under the terms of our indebtedness;   ●  limit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all;   ●  limit our flexibility to plan for and adjust to changing business and market conditions in the industries in which we operate and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;   ●  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to make interest and principal payments on our debt, thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future acquisitions, working capital, business activities, and other general corporate requirements;   ●  limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, to fund growth or for general corporate purposes, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity, particularly if any ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward; and   ●  subject us to higher levels of indebtedness than our competitors, which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce our flexibility in responding to increased competition.  In addition, the restrictive covenants require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests will depend on our ongoing financial and operating performance, which, in turn, will be subject to economic conditions and to financial, market and competitive factors, many of which are beyond our control. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the instruments governing our indebtedness. The interest rates of our term loans are priced using a spread over LIBOR. LIBOR, the London interbank offered rate, is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. We typically use LIBOR as a reference rate in our term loans such that the interest due to our creditors pursuant to a term loan extended to us is calculated using LIBOR. Most of our term loan agreements contain a stated minimum value for LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear if at that time whether or not LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities (“SOFR”). SOFR is observed and backward looking, which stands in contrast with LIBOR under the current methodology, which is an estimated forward-looking rate and relies, to some degree, on the expert judgment of submitting panel members. Given that SOFR is a secured rate backed by government securities, it will be a rate that does not take into account bank credit risk (as is the case with LIBOR). SOFR is therefore likely to be lower than LIBOR and is less likely to correlate with the funding costs of financial institutions. Whether or not SOFR attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question. In a November 30, 2020 announcement, LIBOR’s administrator signaled to the market that USD LIBOR for the most liquid maturities is now likely to continue to be published until June 30, 2023, which would allow time for most legacy contracts to mature before USD LIBOR is no longer available, and would also allow for more time for SOFR to develop.  If LIBOR ceases to exist prior to the maturity of our contracts, we may need to renegotiate our credit agreements that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established. MacroeconomicRisks Uncertainties in foreign economic, political, regulatory and social conditions and fluctuations in foreign currency may adversely affect our results.  Approximately 55 percent, or $1.5 billion, of our net revenue was generated outside the United States in 2020. International operations could be adversely affected by changes in economic, political, regulatory, and social conditions, especially in Brazil, Russia, China, the Middle East, including Turkey and Egypt, and other developing or emerging markets where we do business. An economic downturn in the businesses or geographic areas in which we sell our products could reduce demand for these products and result in a decrease in sales volume that could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Product demand often depends on end-use markets. Economic conditions that reduce consumer confidence or discretionary spending may reduce product demand. Challenging economic conditions may also impair the ability of our customers to pay for products they have purchased, and as a result, our reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. In addition, trade protection measures, anti-bribery and anti-corruption regulations, restrictions on repatriation of earnings, differing intellectual property rights and changes in legal and regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs could adversely affect our results of operations.        11     Table of Contents Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could potentially result in increases or decreases in net revenue, cost of raw materials and earnings and may adversely affect the value of our assets outside the United States. In 2020, the change in foreign currencies negatively impacted our net revenue by approximately $46.3 million. In 2020, we spent approximately $1.5 billion for raw materials worldwide of which approximately $791.3 million was purchased outside the United States. Based on 2020 financial results, a hypothetical one percent change in our cost of sales due to foreign currency rate changes would have resulted in a change in net income of approximately $7.9 million or $0.15 per diluted share. Although we utilize risk management tools, including hedging, as appropriate, to mitigate market fluctuations in foreign currencies, any changes in strategy in regard to risk management tools can also affect revenue, expenses and results of operations and there can be no assurance that such measures will result in cost savings or that all market fluctuation exposure will be eliminated. Distressed financial markets may result in dramatic deflation of financial asset valuations and a general disruption in capital markets.   Adverse equity market conditions and volatility in the credit markets could have a negative impact on the value of our pension trust assets, our future estimated pension liabilities and other postretirement benefit plans. In addition, we could be required to provide increased pension plan funding. As a result, our financial results could be negatively impacted. Reduced access to capital markets may affect our ability to invest in strategic growth initiatives such as acquisitions. In addition, the reduced credit availability could limit our customers’ ability to invest in their businesses, refinance maturing debt obligations, or meet their ongoing working capital needs. If these customers do not have sufficient access to the financial markets, demand for our products may decline. Catastrophic events could disrupt our operations or the operations of our suppliers or customers, having a negative impact on our financial results. Unexpected events, including global pandemics, natural disasters and severe weather events, fires or explosions at our facilities or those of our suppliers, acts of war or terrorism, supply disruptions or breaches of security of our information technology systems could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm our operations, our customers and our suppliers. Such events could reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers and deliver products to our customers. "

 As a global manufacturer of adhesives, sealants and other specialty chemical products, we operate in a business environment that is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Below are the most significant factors that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.      6   Table of Contents Macroeconomic and Industry Risks Uncertainties in foreign economic, political, regulatory and social conditions and fluctuations in foreign currency may adversely affect our results.  Approximately 55 percent, or $1.6 billion, of our net revenue was generated outside the United States in 2019. International operations could be adversely affected by changes in economic, political, regulatory, and social conditions, especially in Brazil, Russia, China, the Middle East, including Turkey and Egypt, and other developing or emerging markets where we do business.

In 2019, the change in foreign currencies negatively impacted our net revenue by approximately $100.0 million. In 2019, we spent approximately $1.5 billion for raw materials worldwide of which approximately $807.4 million was purchased outside the United States. Based on 2019 financial results, a hypothetical one percent change in our cost of sales due to foreign currency rate changes would have resulted in a change in net income of approximately $8.1 million or $0.16 per diluted share.

Whether or not SOFR attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question. As such, the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain. In preparation for the potential phase out of LIBOR, we may need to renegotiate our financial obligations and derivative instruments that utilize LIBOR. However, these efforts may not be successful in mitigating the legal and financial risk from changing the reference rate in our legacy agreements. Furthermore, the discontinuation of LIBOR may adversely impact our ability to manage and hedge exposures to fluctuations in interest rates using derivative instruments.      7   Table of Contents Operational Risks Increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results.  In 2019, raw material costs made up approximately 75 percent of our cost of sales. Accordingly, changes in the cost of raw materials can significantly impact our earnings. Raw materials needed to manufacture products are obtained from a number of suppliers and many of the raw materials are petroleum and natural gas based derivatives. Under normal market conditions, these raw materials are generally available on the open market from a variety of producers. While alternate supplies of most key raw materials are available, supplier production outages may lead to strained supply-demand situations for certain raw materials. The substitution of key raw materials requires us to identify new supply sources, reformulate and re-test and may require seeking re-approval from our customers using those products. From time to time, the prices and availability of these raw materials may fluctuate, which could impair our ability to procure necessary materials, or increase the cost of manufacturing products. If the prices of raw materials increase in a short period of time, we may be unable to pass these increases on to our customers in a timely manner and could experience reductions to our profit margins. Based on 2019 financial results, a hypothetical one percent change in our raw material costs would have resulted in a change in net income of approximately $11.5 million or $0.22 per diluted share. We experience substantial competition in each of the operating segments and geographic areas in which we operate.  Our wide variety of products are sold in numerous markets, each of which is highly competitive. Our competitive position in markets is, in part, subject to external factors. For example, supply and demand for certain of our products is driven by end-use markets and worldwide capacities which, in turn, impact demand for and pricing of our products. Many of our direct competitors are part of large multinational companies and may have more resources than we do. Any increase in competition may result in lost market share or reduced prices, which could result in reduced profit margins. This may impair the ability to grow or even to maintain current levels of revenues and earnings. While we have an extensive customer base, loss of certain top customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations until such business is replaced, and no assurances can be made that we would be able to regain or replace any lost customers. Failure to develop new products and protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our future performance and growth.  Ongoing innovation and product development are important factors in our competitiveness. Failure to create new products and generate new ideas could negatively impact our ability to grow and deliver strong financial results. We continually apply for and obtain U.S. and foreign patents to protect the results of our research for use in our operations and licensing. We are party to a number of patent licenses and other technology agreements. We rely on patents, confidentiality agreements and internal security measures to protect our intellectual property. Failure to protect this intellectual property could negatively affect our future performance and growth. We may be required to record impairment charges on our goodwill or long-lived assets.  Weak demand may cause underutilization of our manufacturing capacity or elimination of product lines; contract terminations or customer shutdowns may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment; or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific product or customer events may require us to record an impairment on tangible assets, such as facilities and equipment, as well as intangible assets, such as intellectual property or goodwill, which would have a negative impact on our financial results. For the fiscal 2019 impairment test, our Flooring and EIMEA (Europe, India, Middle East and Africa) reporting units had headroom of 8 percent and 21 percent, respectively. The recoverability of goodwill is dependent upon the continued growth of cash flows from our business activities. If the economy or business environment falter and we are unable to achieve our assumed revenue growth rates or profit margin percentages, our projections used would need to be remeasured, which could impact the carrying value of our goodwill in one or more of our reporting units. Most significantly, for our Flooring and EIMEA reporting units, a decrease in the planned volume revenue growth would negatively impact the fair value of the reporting units and the calculation of excess carrying value.      8   Table of Contents Catastrophic events could disrupt our operations or the operations of our suppliers or customers, having a negative impact on our financial results. Unexpected events, including natural disasters and severe weather events, fires or explosions at our facilities or those of our suppliers, acts of war or terrorism, supply disruptions or breaches of security of our information technology systems could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm our operations, our customers and our suppliers. Such events could reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers and deliver products to our customers. A failure in our information technology systems could negatively impact our business.  We rely on information technology to record and process transactions, manage our business and maintain the financial accuracy of our records. Our computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from various sources, including power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, vandalism, catastrophic events and human error. Interruptions of our computer systems could disrupt our business, for example by leading to plant downtime and/or power outages, and could result in the loss of business and cause us to incur additional expense. Information technology security threats are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Our information technology systems could be breached by unauthorized outside parties or misused by employees or other insiders intent on extracting sensitive information, corrupting information or disrupting business processes. Such unauthorized access and a failure to effectively recover from breaches could compromise confidential information, disrupt our business, harm our reputation, result in the loss of assets including trade secrets and other intellectual property, customer confidence and business, result in regulatory proceedings and legal claims, and have a negative impact on our financial results. We are in the process of implementing a global Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system that we refer to as Project ONE, which will upgrade and standardize our information system. The North America adhesives business went live in 2014. In 2017, we began the implementation and upgrade of our ERP system in our Latin America adhesives business and implementation for all countries, with the exception of Brazil, was completed as of the end of 2018.  During 2019, other entities in our North America adhesives business went live and in 2020 and beyond, we will continue implementation in North America, EIMEA and Asia Pacific.    Any delays or other failure to achieve our implementation goals may adversely impact our financial results. In addition, the failure to either deliver the application on time or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs could lead to business disruption and loss of business. Failure or abandonment of any part of the ERP system could result in a write-off of part or all of the costs that have been capitalized on the project. Risks Related to Acquisitions Risks associated with acquisitions could have an adverse effect on us and the inability to execute organizational restructuring may affect our results.  As part of our growth strategy, we have made and intend to pursue additional acquisitions of complementary businesses or products and joint ventures. The ability to grow through acquisitions or joint ventures depends upon our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate suitable acquisitions or joint venture arrangements. If we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing business, our results of operations and our cash flows could be adversely affected. Our acquisition strategy also involves other risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return on capital, unidentified issues not discovered in our investigations and evaluations of those strategies and acquisitions and difficulties implementing and maintaining consistent standards, controls, procedures, policies and systems. Future acquisitions could result in debt, dilution, liabilities, increased interest expense, restructuring charges and amortization expenses related to intangible assets. In addition, our profitability is dependent on our ability to drive sustainable productivity improvements such as cost savings through organizational restructuring. Delays or unexpected costs may prevent us from realizing the full operational and financial benefits of such restructuring initiatives and may potentially disrupt our operations.      9   Table of Contents We may not realize the revenue growth opportunities and cost synergies that are anticipated from the Royal Adhesives acquisition as we may experience difficulties in integrating Royal Adhesives’ business with ours. The benefits that are expected to result from the Royal Adhesives acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated revenue growth opportunities and cost synergies as a result of the acquisition. Our success in realizing these revenue growth opportunities and cost synergies, and the timing of this realization, depends on the successful integration of Royal Adhesives. There is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating an acquisition as sizable as Royal Adhesives. The process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, our Royal Adhesives’ activities. Members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage our company, service existing customers, attract new customers and develop new products or strategies. If senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer. There can be no assurance that we will successfully or cost-effectively integrate Royal Adhesives. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Even if we are able to integrate Royal Adhesives successfully, this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the growth opportunities and cost synergies that we currently expect from this integration, and we cannot guarantee that these benefits will be achieved within anticipated timeframes or at all. For example, we may not be able to eliminate duplicative costs. Moreover, we may incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of Royal Adhesives. While it is anticipated that certain expenses will be incurred to achieve cost synergies, such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately, and may exceed current estimates. Accordingly, the benefits from the acquisition may be offset by costs incurred to, or delays in, integrating the businesses. The debt incurred in connection with the Royal Adhesives acquisition could have a negative impact on our liquidity or restrict our activities. As a result of the Royal Adhesives acquisition, our outstanding indebtedness has significantly increased. Our current indebtedness contains various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. Our overall leverage and the terms of our financing arrangements could:   ●  limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions;   ●  make it more difficult to satisfy our obligations under the terms of our indebtedness;   ●  limit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all;   ●  limit our flexibility to plan for and adjust to changing business and market conditions in the industries in which we operate and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;   ●  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to make interest and principal payments on our debt, thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future acquisitions, working capital, business activities, and other general corporate requirements;   ●  limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, to fund growth or for general corporate purposes, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity, particularly if any ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward; and   ●  subject us to higher levels of indebtedness than our competitors, which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce our flexibility in responding to increased competition.  In addition, the restrictive covenants require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests will depend on our ongoing financial and operating performance, which, in turn, will be subject to economic conditions and to financial, market and competitive factors, many of which are beyond our control. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the instruments governing our indebtedness. Legal and Regulatory Risks The impact of changing laws or regulations or the manner of interpretation or enforcement of existing laws or regulations could adversely impact our financial performance and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase our cost of doing business and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. In addition, compliance with laws and regulations is complicated by our substantial global footprint, which will require significant and additional resources to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the various countries where we conduct business.      10   Table of Contents Our global operations expose us to trade and economic sanctions and other restrictions imposed by the U.S., the EU and other governments and organizations. The U.S. Departments of Justice, Commerce, State and Treasury and other federal agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals for violations of economic sanctions laws, export control laws, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and other federal statutes and regulations, including those established by OFAC. Under these laws and regulations, as well as other anti-corruption laws, anti-money laundering laws, export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations, various government agencies may require export licenses, may seek to impose modifications to business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned persons or entities and modifications to compliance programs, which may increase compliance costs, and may subject us to fines, penalties and other sanctions. A violation of these laws, regulations, policies or procedures could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we have implemented policies and procedures in these areas, we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures are sufficient or that directors, officers, employees, representatives, manufacturers, suppliers and agents have not engaged and will not engage in conduct in violation of such policies and procedures. We have lawsuits and claims against us with uncertain outcomes. Our operations from time to time are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. The results of any future litigation or settlement of such lawsuits and claims are inherently unpredictable, but such outcomes could be adverse and material in amount. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a discussion of current litigation. Costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental laws and regulations may negatively impact our operations and financial results.   We are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that impose various environmental controls on us or otherwise relate to environmental protection, the sale and export of certain chemicals or hazardous materials, and various health and safety matters. The costs of complying with these laws and regulations can be significant and may increase as applicable requirements and their enforcement become more stringent and new rules are implemented. Adverse developments and/or periodic settlements could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a discussion of current environmental matters. Additional income tax expense or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a negative impact on our financial results.  We are subject to income tax laws and regulations in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions.  Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes.  Our income tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions.  Our income tax provision and income tax liabilities could be adversely affected by the jurisdictional mix of earnings, changes in valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and regulations.  In the ordinary course of our business, we are also subject to continuous examinations of our income tax returns by tax authorities.  Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final results of any tax examination or related litigation could be materially different from our related historical income tax provisions and accruals.  Adverse developments in an audit, examination or litigation related to previously filed tax returns, or in the relevant jurisdiction’s tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles and interpretations could have a material effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. Income tax law changes could have unforeseen effects on our financial condition and results of operations.  On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law H.R. 1, originally known as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act”, hereafter referred to as “U.S. Tax Reform”. Since the passing of U.S. Tax Reform, additional guidance in the form of notices and proposed regulations which interpret various aspects of U.S. Tax Reform have been issued. As of the filing of this document, additional guidance is expected. Changes could be made to the proposed regulations as they become finalized, future legislation could be enacted, more regulations and notices could be issued, all of which may impact our financial results. We will continue to monitor all of these changes and will reflect the impact as appropriate in future financial statements. Many state and local tax jurisdictions are still determining how they will interpret elements of U.S. Tax Reform. Final state and local governments’ conformity, legislation and guidance relating to U.S. Tax Reform may impact our financial results. In general, foreign tax changes could have an impact on our deferred taxes, as well as, the Company’s tax expense. We continue to monitor such reform and record any such impact in the appropriate period.      11   Table of Contents "
14,FUL,FULLER (H. B.) CO,2019-01-28,"Risk Factors
 As a global manufacturer of adhesives, sealants and other specialty chemical products, we operate in a business environment that is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Below are the most significant factors that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Macroeconomic and Industry Risks Uncertainties in foreign economic, political, regulatory and social conditions and fluctuations in foreign currency may adversely affect our results.  Approximately 55 percent, or $1.7 billion, of our net revenue was generated outside the United States in 2018. International operations could be adversely affected by changes in economic, political, regulatory, and social conditions, especially in Brazil, Russia, China, the Middle East, including Turkey and Egypt, and other developing or emerging markets where we do business. An economic downturn in the businesses or geographic areas in which we sell our products could reduce demand for these products and result in a decrease in sales volume that could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Product demand often depends on end-use markets. Economic conditions that reduce consumer confidence or discretionary spending may reduce product demand. Challenging economic conditions may also impair the ability of our customers to pay for products they have purchased, and as a result, our reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. In addition, trade protection measures, anti-bribery and anti-corruption regulations, restrictions on repatriation of earnings, differing intellectual property rights and changes in legal and regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs could adversely affect our results of operations. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could potentially result in increases or decreases in net revenue, cost of raw materials and earnings and may adversely affect the value of our assets outside the United States. In 2018, the change in foreign currencies negatively impacted our net revenue by approximately $2.0 million. In 2018, we spent approximately $1.7 billion for raw materials worldwide of which approximately $869.1 million was purchased outside the United States. Based on 2018 financial results, a hypothetical one percent change in our cost of sales due to foreign currency rate changes would have resulted in a change in net income of approximately $8.3 million or $0.16 per diluted share. Although we utilize risk management tools, including hedging, as appropriate, to mitigate market fluctuations in foreign currencies, any changes in strategy in regard to risk management tools can also affect revenue, expenses and results of operations and there can be no assurance that such measures will result in cost savings or that all market fluctuation exposure will be eliminated. Distressed financial markets may result in dramatic deflation of financial asset valuations and a general disruption in capital markets.   Adverse equity market conditions and volatility in the credit markets could have a negative impact on the value of our pension trust assets, our future estimated pension liabilities and other postretirement benefit plans. In addition, we could be required to provide increased pension plan funding. As a result, our financial results could be negatively impacted. Reduced access to capital markets may affect our ability to invest in strategic growth initiatives such as acquisitions. In addition, the reduced credit availability could limit our customers’ ability to invest in their businesses, refinance maturing debt obligations, or meet their ongoing working capital needs. If these customers do not have sufficient access to the financial markets, demand for our products may decline. The interest rates of our term loans are priced using a spread over LIBOR. LIBOR, the London interbank offered rate, is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. We typically use LIBOR as a reference rate in our term loans such that the interest due to our creditors pursuant to a term loan extended to us is calculated using LIBOR. Most of our term loan agreements contain a stated minimum value for LIBOR. 7Table of Contents On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear if at that time whether or not LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities (“SOFR”). SOFR is observed and backward looking, which stands in contrast with LIBOR under the current methodology, which is an estimated forward-looking rate and relies, to some degree, on the expert judgment of submitting panel members. Given that SOFR is a secured rate backed by government securities, it will be a rate that does not take into account bank credit risk (as is the case with LIBOR). SOFR is therefore likely to be lower than LIBOR and is less likely to correlate with the funding costs of financial institutions. Whether or not SOFR attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question. As such, the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate our credit agreements with that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established. Operational Risks Increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results.  In 2018, raw material costs made up approximately 75 percent of our cost of sales. Accordingly, changes in the cost of raw materials can significantly impact our earnings. Raw materials needed to manufacture products are obtained from a number of suppliers and many of the raw materials are petroleum and natural gas based derivatives. Under normal market conditions, these raw materials are generally available on the open market from a variety of producers. While alternate supplies of most key raw materials are available, supplier production outages may lead to strained supply-demand situations for certain raw materials. The substitution of key raw materials requires us to identify new supply sources, reformulate and re-test and may require seeking re-approval from our customers using those products. From time to time, the prices and availability of these raw materials may fluctuate, which could impair our ability to procure necessary materials, or increase the cost of manufacturing products. If the prices of raw materials increase in a short period of time, we may be unable to pass these increases on to our customers in a timely manner and could experience reductions to our profit margins. Based on 2018 financial results, a hypothetical one percent change in our raw material costs would have resulted in a change in net income of approximately $12.1 million or $0.23 per diluted share. We experience substantial competition in each of the operating segments and geographic areas in which we operate.  Our wide variety of products are sold in numerous markets, each of which is highly competitive. Our competitive position in markets is, in part, subject to external factors. For example, supply and demand for certain of our products is driven by end-use markets and worldwide capacities which, in turn, impact demand for and pricing of our products. Many of our direct competitors are part of large multinational companies and may have more resources than we do. Any increase in competition may result in lost market share or reduced prices, which could result in reduced profit margins. This may impair the ability to grow or even to maintain current levels of revenues and earnings. While we have an extensive customer base, loss of certain top customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations until such business is replaced, and no assurances can be made that we would be able to regain or replace any lost customers. Failure to develop new products and protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our future performance and growth.  Ongoing innovation and product development are important factors in our competitiveness. Failure to create new products and generate new ideas could negatively impact our ability to grow and deliver strong financial results. We continually apply for and obtain U.S. and foreign patents to protect the results of our research for use in our operations and licensing. We are party to a number of patent licenses and other technology agreements. We rely on patents, confidentiality agreements and internal security measures to protect our intellectual property. Failure to protect this intellectual property could negatively affect our future performance and growth. We may be required to record impairment charges on our goodwill or long-lived assets.  Weak demand may cause underutilization of our manufacturing capacity or elimination of product lines; contract terminations or customer shutdowns may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment; or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific product or customer events may require us to record an impairment on tangible assets, such as facilities and equipment, as well as intangible assets, such as intellectual property or goodwill, which would have a negative impact on our financial results. 8Table of Contents Catastrophic events could disrupt our operations or the operations of our suppliers or customers, having a negative impact on our financial results. Unexpected events, including natural disasters and severe weather events, fires or explosions at our facilities or those of our suppliers, acts of war or terrorism, supply disruptions or breaches of security of our information technology systems could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm our operations, our customers and our suppliers. Such events could reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers and deliver products to our customers. A failure in our information technology systems could negatively impact our business.  We rely on information technology to record and process transactions, manage our business and maintain the financial accuracy of our records. Our computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from various sources, including power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, vandalism, catastrophic events and human error. Interruptions of our computer systems could disrupt our business, for example by leading to plant downtime and/or power outages, and could result in the loss of business and cause us to incur additional expense. Information technology security threats are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Our information technology systems could be breached by unauthorized outside parties or misused by employees or other insiders intent on extracting sensitive information, corrupting information or disrupting business processes. Such unauthorized access and a failure to effectively recover from breaches could compromise confidential information, disrupt our business, harm our reputation, result in the loss of assets including trade secrets and other intellectual property, customer confidence and business, result in regulatory proceedings and legal claims, and have a negative impact on our financial results. We are in the process of implementing a global Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system that we refer to as Project ONE, which will upgrade and standardize our information system. The North America adhesives business went live in 2014. In 2017, we began the implementation and upgrade of our ERP system in our Latin America adhesives business and implementation for all countries, with the exception of Brazil, has been completed as of the end of 2018. During 2019 and beyond, we will continue implementation in North America, EIMEA (Europe, India, Middle East and Africa) and Asia Pacific.     Any delays or other failure to achieve our implementation goals may adversely impact our financial results. In addition, the failure to either deliver the application on time or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs could lead to business disruption and loss of business. Failure or abandonment of any part of the ERP system could result in a write-off of part or all of the costs that have been capitalized on the project. Risks Related to Acquisitions Risks associated with acquisitions could have an adverse effect on us and the inability to execute organizational restructuring may affect our results.  As part of our growth strategy, we have made and intend to pursue additional acquisitions of complementary businesses or products and joint ventures. The ability to grow through acquisitions or joint ventures depends upon our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate suitable acquisitions or joint venture arrangements. If we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing business, our results of operations and our cash flows could be adversely affected. Our acquisition strategy also involves other risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return on capital, unidentified issues not discovered in our investigations and evaluations of those strategies and acquisitions and difficulties implementing and maintaining consistent standards, controls, procedures, policies and systems. Future acquisitions could result in debt, dilution, liabilities, increased interest expense, restructuring charges and amortization expenses related to intangible assets. In addition, our profitability is dependent on our ability to drive sustainable productivity improvements such as cost savings through organizational restructuring. Delays or unexpected costs may prevent us from realizing the full operational and financial benefits of such restructuring initiatives and may potentially disrupt our operations. 9Table of Contents We may not realize the revenue growth opportunities and cost synergies that are anticipated from the Royal Adhesives acquisition as we may experience difficulties in integrating Royal Adhesives’ business with ours. The benefits that are expected to result from the Royal Adhesives acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated revenue growth opportunities and cost synergies as a result of the acquisition. Our success in realizing these revenue growth opportunities and cost synergies, and the timing of this realization, depends on the successful integration of Royal Adhesives. There is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating an acquisition as sizable as Royal Adhesives. The process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, our Royal Adhesives’ activities. Members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage our company, service existing customers, attract new customers and develop new products or strategies. If senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer. There can be no assurance that we will successfully or cost-effectively integrate Royal Adhesives. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Even if we are able to integrate Royal Adhesives successfully, this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the growth opportunities and cost synergies that we currently expect from this integration, and we cannot guarantee that these benefits will be achieved within anticipated timeframes or at all. For example, we may not be able to eliminate duplicative costs. Moreover, we may incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of Royal Adhesives. While it is anticipated that certain expenses will be incurred to achieve cost synergies, such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately, and may exceed current estimates. Accordingly, the benefits from the acquisition may be offset by costs incurred to, or delays in, integrating the businesses. The debt incurred in connection with the Royal Adhesives acquisition could have a negative impact on our liquidity or restrict our activities. As a result of the Royal Adhesives acquisition, our outstanding indebtedness has significantly increased. Our current indebtedness contains various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. Our overall leverage and the terms of our financing arrangements could:  ●limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions; ●make it more difficult to satisfy our obligations under the terms of our indebtedness; ●limit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all; ●limit our flexibility to plan for and adjust to changing business and market conditions in the industries in which we operate and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; ●require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to make interest and principal payments on our debt, thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future acquisitions, working capital, business activities, and other general corporate requirements; ●limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, to fund growth or for general corporate purposes, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity, particularly if any ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward; and ●subject us to higher levels of indebtedness than our competitors, which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce our flexibility in responding to increased competition. In addition, the restrictive covenants require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests will depend on our ongoing financial and operating performance, which, in turn, will be subject to economic conditions and to financial, market and competitive factors, many of which are beyond our control. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the instruments governing our indebtedness. Legal and Regulatory Risks The impact of changing laws or regulations or the manner of interpretation or enforcement of existing laws or regulations could adversely impact our financial performance and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase our cost of doing business and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. In addition, compliance with laws and regulations is complicated by our substantial global footprint, which will require significant and additional resources to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the various countries where we conduct business. 10Table of Contents Our global operations expose us to trade and economic sanctions and other restrictions imposed by the U.S., the EU and other governments and organizations. The U.S. Departments of Justice, Commerce, State and Treasury and other federal agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals for violations of economic sanctions laws, export control laws, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and other federal statutes and regulations, including those established by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). Under these laws and regulations, as well as other anti-corruption laws, anti-money-laundering laws, export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations, various government agencies may require export licenses, may seek to impose modifications to business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned persons or entities and modifications to compliance programs, which may increase compliance costs, and may subject us to fines, penalties and other sanctions. A violation of these laws, regulations, policies or procedures could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we have implemented policies and procedures in these areas, we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures are sufficient or that directors, officers, employees, representatives, manufacturers, suppliers and agents have not engaged and will not engage in conduct in violation of such policies and procedures. We have lawsuits and claims against us with uncertain outcomes. Our operations from time to time are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. The results of any future litigation or settlement of such lawsuits and claims are inherently unpredictable, but such outcomes could be adverse and material in amount. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a discussion of current litigation. Costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental laws and regulations may negatively impact our operations and financial results.   We are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that impose various environmental controls on us or otherwise relate to environmental protection, the sale and export of certain chemicals or hazardous materials, and various health and safety matters. The costs of complying with these laws and regulations can be significant and may increase as applicable requirements and their enforcement become more stringent and new rules are implemented. Adverse developments and/or periodic settlements could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a discussion of current environmental matters. Additional income tax expense or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a negative impact on our financial results.  We are subject to income tax laws and regulations in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions.  Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes.  Our income tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions.  Our income tax provision and income tax liabilities could be adversely affected by the jurisdictional mix of earnings, changes in valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and regulations.  In the ordinary course of our business, we are also subject to continuous examinations of our income tax returns by tax authorities.  Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final results of any tax examination or related litigation could be materially different from our related historical income tax provisions and accruals.  Adverse developments in an audit, examination or litigation related to previously filed tax returns, or in the relevant jurisdiction’s tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles and interpretations could have a material effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. Federal income tax reform could have unforeseen effects on our financial condition and results of operations.  On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law H.R. 1, originally known as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act”, hereafter referred to as “U.S. Tax Reform”. Since the passing of U.S. Tax Reform, additional guidance in the form of notices and proposed regulations which interpret various aspects of U.S. Tax Reform have been issued.  As of the filing of this document, additional guidance is expected.  Changes could be made to the proposed regulations as they become finalized, future legislation could be enacted, more regulations and notices could be issued, all of which may impact our financial results.  We will continue to monitor all of these changes and will reflect the impact as appropriate in future financial statements.  Many state and local tax jurisdictions are still determining how they will interpret elements of U.S. Tax Reform.  Final state and local governments’ conformity, legislation and guidance relating to U.S. Tax Reform may impact our financial results. 11Table of Contents "
9,FUL,FULLER (H. B.) CO,2018-01-31,"Risk Factors
 As a global manufacturer of adhesives, sealants and other specialty chemical products, we operate in a business environment that is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Below are the most significant factors that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 7Table of Contents Macroeconomic and Industry Risks Uncertainties in foreign economic, political, regulatory and social conditions and fluctuations in foreign currency may adversely affect our results.  Approximately 58 percent, or $1.3 billion, of our net revenue was generated outside the United States in 2017. After the acquisitions of Royal Adhesives and Adecol, we expect our revenue generated outside the United States to be approximately 58 percent. International operations could be adversely affected by changes in economic, political, regulatory, and social conditions, especially in Brazil, Russia, China, the Middle East, including Turkey and Egypt, and other developing or emerging markets where we do business. An economic downturn in the businesses or geographic areas in which we sell our products could reduce demand for these products and result in a decrease in sales volume that could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Product demand often depends on end-use markets. Economic conditions that reduce consumer confidence or discretionary spending may reduce product demand. Challenging economic conditions may also impair the ability of our customers to pay for products they have purchased, and as a result, our reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. In addition, trade protection measures, anti-bribery and anti-corruption regulations, restrictions on repatriation of earnings, differing intellectual property rights and changes in legal and regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs could adversely affect our results of operations.  Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could potentially result in increases or decreases in net revenue, cost of raw materials and earnings and may adversely affect the value of our assets outside the United States. In 2017, the change in foreign currencies negatively impacted our net revenue by approximately $46 million. In 2017, we spent approximately $1.3 billion for raw materials worldwide of which approximately $705.6 million was purchased outside the United States. Based on 2017 financial results, a hypothetical one percent change in our cost of sales due to foreign currency rate changes would have resulted in a change in net income of approximately $7.0 million or $0.14 per diluted share. Although we utilize risk management tools, including hedging, as appropriate, to mitigate market fluctuations in foreign currencies, any changes in strategy in regard to risk management tools can also affect revenue, expenses and results of operations and there can be no assurance that such measures will result in cost savings or that all market fluctuation exposure will be eliminated. Distressed financial markets may result in dramatic deflation of asset valuations and a general disruption in capital markets.   Adverse equity market conditions and volatility in the credit markets could have a negative impact on the value of our pension trust assets, our future estimated pension liabilities and other postretirement benefit plans. In addition, we could be required to provide increased pension plan funding. As a result, our financial results could be negatively impacted. Reduced access to capital markets may affect our ability to invest in strategic growth initiatives such as acquisitions. In addition, the reduced credit availability could limit our customers’ ability to invest in their businesses, refinance maturing debt obligations, or meet their ongoing working capital needs. If these customers do not have sufficient access to the financial markets, demand for our products may decline. Operational Risks Increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results.  In 2017, raw material costs made up over 76 percent of our cost of sales. Accordingly, changes in the cost of raw materials can significantly impact our earnings. Raw materials needed to manufacture products are obtained from a number of suppliers and many of the raw materials are petroleum and natural gas based derivatives. Under normal market conditions, these raw materials are generally available on the open market from a variety of producers. While alternate supplies of most key raw materials are available, supplier production outages may lead to strained supply-demand situations for certain raw materials. The substitution of key raw materials requires us to identify new supply sources, reformulate and re-test and may require seeking re-approval from our customers using those products. From time to time, the prices and availability of these raw materials may fluctuate, which could impair our ability to procure necessary materials, or increase the cost of manufacturing products. If the prices of raw materials increase in a short period of time, we may be unable to pass these increases on to our customers in a timely manner and could experience reductions to our profit margins. Based on 2017 financial results, a hypothetical one percent change in our raw material costs would have resulted in a change in net income of approximately $10.0 million or $0.19 per diluted share. We experience substantial competition in each of the operating segments and geographic areas in which we operate.  Our wide variety of products are sold in numerous markets, each of which is highly competitive. Our competitive position in markets is, in part, subject to external factors. For example, supply and demand for certain of our products is driven by end-use markets and worldwide capacities which, in turn, impact demand for and pricing of our products. Many of our direct competitors are part of large multinational companies and may have more resources than we do. Any increase in competition may result in lost market share or reduced prices, which could result in reduced profit margins. This may impair the ability to grow or even to maintain current levels of revenues and earnings. While we have an extensive customer base, loss of certain top customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations until such business is replaced, and no assurances can be made that we would be able to regain or replace any lost customers. 8Table of Contents Failure to develop new products and protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our future performance and growth.  Ongoing innovation and product development are important factors in our competitiveness. Failure to create new products and generate new ideas could negatively impact our ability to grow and deliver strong financial results. We continually apply for and obtain U.S. and foreign patents to protect the results of our research for use in our operations and licensing. We are party to a number of patent licenses and other technology agreements. We rely on patents, confidentiality agreements and internal security measures to protect our intellectual property. Failure to protect this intellectual property could negatively affect our future performance and growth. We may be required to record impairment charges on our long-lived assets.  Weak demand may cause underutilization of our manufacturing capacity or elimination of product lines; contract terminations or customer shutdowns may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment; or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific product or customer events may require us to record an impairment on tangible assets, such as facilities and equipment, as well as intangible assets, such as intellectual property or goodwill, which would have a negative impact on our financial results. Catastrophic events could disrupt our operations or the operations of our suppliers or customers, having a negative impact on our financial results. Unexpected events, including natural disasters and severe weather events, fires or explosions at our facilities or those of our suppliers, acts of war or terrorism, supply disruptions or breaches of security of our information technology systems could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm our operations, our customers and our suppliers. Such events could reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers and deliver products to our customers. A failure in our information technology systems could negatively impact our business.  We rely on information technology to record and process transactions, manage our business and maintain the financial accuracy of our records. Our computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from various sources, including power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, vandalism, catastrophic events and human error. Interruptions of our computer systems could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of business and cause us to incur additional expense. Information technology security threats are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Our information technology systems could be breached by unauthorized outside parties or misused by employees or other insiders intent on extracting sensitive information, corrupting information or disrupting business processes. Such unauthorized access could compromise confidential information, disrupt our business, harm our reputation, result in the loss of assets, customer confidence and business and have a negative impact on our financial results. We are in the process of implementing a global Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system, which we refer to as Project ONE, which will upgrade and standardize our information system. The North America adhesives business went live in 2014, and the implementation process proved to be more difficult than we originally anticipated resulting in disruptions in our manufacturing network, lower productivity and deteriorated customer service levels. By the end of 2014, most of the problems associated with the software implementation had been remediated and the business was stable and running at capacity with productivity levels approaching the levels experienced prior to the new software implementation. In late 2014, we suspended any further implementation projects in other geographic regions until we complete the optimization of the current platform for the North America adhesives business. In 2017, we re-initiated the project and began the implementation and upgrade of our ERP system in our Latin America adhesives business.  The new ERP system went live in Argentina at the beginning of fiscal 2018.  We expect full implementation of our ERP system in in the remaining countries within our Latin America adhesives business in early 2019, followed by continued implementation in North America (including our acquired businesses and Construction Products business), EIMEA and Asia Pacific.   Any delays or other failure to achieve our implementation goals may adversely impact our financial results. In addition, the failure to either deliver the application on time or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs could lead to business disruption and loss of business. Failure or abandonment of any part of the ERP system could result in a write-off of part or all of the costs that have been capitalized on the project. 9Table of Contents Risks associated with acquisitions could have an adverse effect on us and the inability to execute organizational restructuring may affect our results.  As part of our growth strategy, we have made and intend to pursue additional acquisitions of complementary businesses or products and joint ventures. The ability to grow through acquisitions or joint ventures depends upon our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate suitable acquisitions or joint venture arrangements. If we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing business, our results of operations and our cash flows could be adversely affected. Our acquisition strategy also involves other risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return on capital, unidentified issues not discovered in our investigations and evaluations of those strategies and acquisitions and difficulties implementing and maintaining consistent standards, controls, procedures, policies and systems. Future acquisitions could result in debt, dilution, liabilities, increased interest expense, restructuring charges and amortization expenses related to intangible assets. In addition, our profitability is dependent on our ability to drive sustainable productivity improvements such as cost savings through organizational restructuring. Delays or unexpected costs may prevent us from realizing the full operational and financial benefits of such restructuring initiatives and may potentially disrupt our operations. Risks Related to the Royal Adhesives Acquisition We may not realize the revenue growth opportunities and cost synergies that are anticipated from the Royal Adhesives acquisition as we may experience difficulties in integrating Royal Adhesives’ business with ours. The benefits that are expected to result from the Royal Adhesives acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated revenue growth opportunities and cost synergies as a result of the acquisition. Our success in realizing these revenue growth opportunities and cost synergies, and the timing of this realization, depends on the successful integration of Royal Adhesives. There is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating an acquisition as sizable as Royal Adhesives. The process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, our and Royal Adhesives’ activities. Members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage our company, service existing customers, attract new customers and develop new products or strategies. If senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer. There can be no assurance that we will successfully or cost-effectively integrate Royal Adhesives. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Even if we are able to integrate Royal Adhesives successfully, this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the growth opportunities and cost synergies that we currently expect from this integration, and we cannot guarantee that these benefits will be achieved within anticipated timeframes or at all. For example, we may not be able to eliminate duplicative costs. Moreover, we may incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of Royal Adhesives. While it is anticipated that certain expenses will be incurred to achieve cost synergies, such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately, and may exceed current estimates. Accordingly, the benefits from the acquisition may be offset by costs incurred to, or delays in, integrating the businesses. The debt incurred in connection with the Royal Adhesives acquisition could have a negative impact on our liquidity or restrict our activities. As a result of the Royal Adhesives acquisition, our outstanding indebtedness has significantly increased. Our current indebtedness contains various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. Our overall leverage and the terms of our financing arrangements could:  ●limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions; ●make it more difficult to satisfy our obligations under the terms of our indebtedness; ●limit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all; 10Table of Contents  ●limit our flexibility to plan for and adjust to changing business and market conditions in the industries in which we operate and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; ●require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to make interest and principal payments on our debt, thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future acquisitions, working capital, business activities, and other general corporate requirements; ●limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, to fund growth or for general corporate purposes, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity, particularly if any ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward; and ●subject us to higher levels of indebtedness than our competitors, which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce our flexibility in responding to increased competition. In addition, the restrictive covenants require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests will depend on our ongoing financial and operating performance, which, in turn, will be subject to economic conditions and to financial, market, and competitive factors, many of which are beyond our control. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the instruments governing our indebtedness. Royal Adhesives may have liabilities that are not known, probable or estimable at this time. As a result of the Royal Adhesives acquisition, Royal Adhesives became our subsidiary and it will remain subject to all of its liabilities. There could be unasserted claims or assessments that we failed or were unable to discover or identify in the course of performing due diligence investigations of Royal Adhesives. In addition, there may be liabilities that are neither probable nor estimable at this time that may become probable or estimable in the future. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. We may learn additional information about Royal Adhesives that adversely affects us, such as unknown, unasserted or contingent liabilities and issues relating to compliance with applicable laws. Without limitation to the generality of the foregoing, Royal Adhesives is subject to various rules, regulations, laws and other legal requirements, enforced by governments or other public authorities. Misconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by any of Royal Adhesives’ directors, officers, employees or agents could have a significant impact on Royal Adhesives’ business and reputation and could subject Royal Adhesives to fines and penalties, criminal, civil and administrative legal sanctions and suspension from contracting (including with public bodies), resulting in reduced revenues and profits. Such misconduct could include the failure to comply with regulations prohibiting bribery, regulations on lobbying or similar activities, control over financial reporting, environmental laws and any other applicable laws or regulations. As a result of the Royal Adhesives acquisition, we may become subject to additional risks and uncertainties relating to Royal Adhesives and its business. As a result of the Royal Adhesives acquisition, we are subject to additional risks associated with Royal Adhesives, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The integration process may be complex, costly and time-consuming, as Royal Adhesives was not previously operating as a public company. The difficulties of integrating the businesses include, among others:  ●failure to implement our business plan for the combined company; ●unanticipated issues in integrating equipment, logistics, information, communications and other systems; ●possible inconsistencies in standards, controls, contracts, procedures and policies; ●impacts of change in control provisions in contracts and agreements; ●failure to retain key customers and suppliers; ●unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations; ●failure to recruit and retain key employees to operate the combined business; ●increased competition within the industries in which Royal Adhesives operates; ●inherent operating risks in the business; ●unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities; ●additional reporting requirements pursuant to applicable rules and regulations; and ●additional requirements relating to internal control over financial reporting. 11Table of Contents  Legal and Regulatory Risks We have lawsuits and claims against us with uncertain outcomes. Our operations from time to time are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. The results of any future litigation or settlement of such lawsuits and claims are inherently unpredictable, but such outcomes could be adverse and material in amount. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a discussion of current litigation. Costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental laws and regulations may negatively impact our operations and financial results.   We are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that impose various environmental controls on us or otherwise relate to environmental protection, the sale and export of certain chemicals or hazardous materials, and various health and safety matters. The costs of complying with these laws and regulations can be significant and may increase as applicable requirements and their enforcement become more stringent and new rules are implemented. Adverse developments and/or periodic settlements could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a discussion of current environmental matters. Additional income tax expense or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a negative impact on our financial results.  We are subject to income tax laws and regulations in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions.  Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes.  Our income tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions.  Our income tax provision and income tax liabilities could be adversely affected by the jurisdictional mix of earnings, changes in valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and regulations.  In the ordinary course of our business, we are also subject to continuous examinations of our income tax returns by tax authorities.  Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final results of any tax examination or related litigation could be materially different from our related historical income tax provisions and accruals.  Adverse developments in an audit, examination, litigation related to previously filed tax returns, or in the relevant jurisdiction’s tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles and interpretations could have a material effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. Federal income tax reform could have unforeseen effects on our financial condition and results of operations. On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law H.R. 1, originally known as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act”, hereafter referred to as “U.S. Tax Reform”. The Company is in the process of determining the impact to the financial statements of all aspects of U.S. Tax Reform and will reflect the impact of such reform in the financial statements during the period in which such amounts can be reasonably estimated.  U.S. Tax Reform includes a number of provisions, including the lowering of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018, which will result in a blended federal tax rate for fiscal year 2018.  There are also provisions that may partially offset the benefit of such rate reduction, such as the repeal of the deduction for domestic production activities.  U.S. Tax Reform also includes international provisions, which generally establish a territorial-style system for taxing foreign-source income of domestic multinational corporations.   Financial statement impacts will include adjustments for the re-measurement of deferred tax assets (liabilities) and the accrual for deemed repatriation tax on unremitted foreign earnings and profits.  While there are benefits, there is also substantial uncertainty regarding the details of U.S. Tax Reform. The intended and unintended consequences of U.S. Tax Reform on our business and on holders of our common shares is uncertain and could be adverse.  The Company anticipates that the impact of U.S. Tax Reform may be material to the income tax expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income and related income tax balances on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Statement of Cash Flows.  "
13,FUL,FULLER (H. B.) CO,2017-01-31,"Risk Factors
 As a global manufacturer of adhesives, sealants and other specialty chemical products, we operate in a business environment that is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Below are the most significant factors that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Macroeconomic and Industry Risks Uncertainties in foreign economic, political, regulatory and social conditions and fluctuations in foreign currency may adversely affect our results.  Approximately 58 percent, or $1.2 billion, of our net revenue was generated outside the United States in 2016. International operations could be adversely affected by changes in economic, political, regulatory, and social conditions, especially in Russia, China, the Middle East, including Turkey and Egypt, and other developing or emerging markets where we do business. An economic downturn in the businesses or geographic areas in which we sell our products could reduce demand for these products and result in a decrease in sales volume that could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Product demand often depends on end-use markets. Economic conditions that reduce consumer confidence or discretionary spending may reduce product demand. Challenging economic conditions may also impair the ability of our customers to pay for products they have purchased, and as a result, our reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. In addition, trade protection measures, anti-bribery and anti-corruption regulations, restrictions on repatriation of earnings, differing intellectual property rights and changes in legal and regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs could adversely affect our results of operations.   7Table Of Contents  Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could potentially result in increases or decreases in net revenue, cost of raw materials and earnings and may adversely affect the value of our assets outside the United States. In 2016, the change in foreign currencies negatively impacted our net revenue by approximately $38 million. In 2016, we spent approximately $1.1 billion for raw materials worldwide of which approximately $623.3 million was purchased outside the United States. Based on 2016 financial results, a hypothetical one percent change in our cost of sales due to foreign currency rate changes would have resulted in a change in net income of approximately $4.7 million or $0.09 per diluted share. Although we utilize risk management tools, including hedging, as appropriate, to mitigate market fluctuations in foreign currencies, any changes in strategy in regard to risk management tools can also affect revenue, expenses and results of operations and there can be no assurance that such measures will result in cost savings or that all market fluctuation exposure will be eliminated. Distressed financial markets may result in dramatic deflation of asset valuations and a general disruption in capital markets.   Adverse equity market conditions and volatility in the credit markets could have a negative impact on the value of our pension trust assets, our future estimated pension liabilities and other postretirement benefit plans. In addition, we could be required to provide increased pension plan funding. As a result, our financial results could be negatively impacted. Reduced access to capital markets may affect our ability to invest in strategic growth initiatives such as acquisitions. In addition, the reduced credit availability could limit our customers’ ability to invest in their businesses, refinance maturing debt obligations, or meet their ongoing working capital needs. If these customers do not have sufficient access to the financial markets, demand for our products may decline. Operational Risks Increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results.  In 2016, raw material costs made up over 75 percent of our cost of sales. Accordingly, changes in the cost of raw materials can significantly impact our earnings. Raw materials needed to manufacture products are obtained from a number of suppliers and many of the raw materials are petroleum and natural gas based derivatives. Under normal market conditions, these raw materials are generally available on the open market from a variety of producers. While alternate supplies of most key raw materials are available, supplier production outages may lead to strained supply-demand situations for certain raw materials. The substitution of key raw materials requires us to identify new supply sources, reformulate, re-test and may require seeking re-approval from our customers using those products. From time to time, the prices and availability of these raw materials may fluctuate, which could impair our ability to procure necessary materials, or increase the cost of manufacturing products. If the prices of raw materials increase in a short period of time, we may be unable to pass these increases on to our customers in a timely manner and could experience reductions to our profit margins. Based on 2016 financial results, a hypothetical one percent change in our raw material costs would have resulted in a change in net income of approximately $7.7 million or $0.15 per diluted share. We experience substantial competition in each of the operating segments and geographic areas in which we operate.  Our wide variety of products are sold in numerous markets, each of which is highly competitive. Our competitive position in markets is, in part, subject to external factors. For example, supply and demand for certain of our products is driven by end-use markets and worldwide capacities which, in turn, impact demand for and pricing of our products. Many of our direct competitors are part of large multinational companies and may have more resources than we do. Any increase in competition may result in lost market share or reduced prices, which could result in reduced profit margins. This may impair the ability to grow or even to maintain current levels of revenues and earnings. While we have an extensive customer base, loss of certain top customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations until such business is replaced, and no assurances can be made that we would be able to regain or replace any lost customers.  8Table Of Contents  Failure to develop new products and protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our future performance and growth.  Ongoing innovation and product development are important factors in our competitiveness. Failure to create new products and generate new ideas could negatively impact our ability to grow and deliver strong financial results. We continually apply for and obtain U.S. and foreign patents to protect the results of our research for use in our operations and licensing. We are party to a substantial number of patent licenses and other technology agreements. We rely on patents, confidentiality agreements and internal security measures to protect our intellectual property. Failure to protect this intellectual property could negatively affect our future performance and growth. We may be required to record impairment charges on our long-lived assets.  Weak demand may cause underutilization of our manufacturing capacity or elimination of product lines; contract terminations or customer shutdowns may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment; or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific product or customer events may require us to record an impairment on tangible assets, such as facilities and equipment, as well as intangible assets, such as intellectual property or goodwill, which would have a negative impact on our financial results. Catastrophic events could disrupt our operations or the operations of our suppliers or customers, having a negative impact on our financial results.  Unexpected events, including natural disasters and severe weather events, fires or explosions at our facilities or those of our suppliers, acts of war or terrorism, supply disruptions or breaches of security of our information technology systems could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm our operations, our customers and our suppliers. Such events could reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers and deliver products to our customers. A failure in our information technology systems could negatively impact our business.  We rely on information technology to record and process transactions, manage our business and maintain the financial accuracy of our records. Our computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from various sources, including power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, vandalism, catastrophic events and human error. Interruptions of our computer systems could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of business and cause us to incur additional expense. Information technology security threats are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Our information technology systems could be breached by unauthorized outside parties or misused by employees or other insiders intent on extracting sensitive information, corrupting information or disrupting business processes. Such unauthorized access could compromise confidential information, disrupt our business, harm our reputation, result in the loss of assets, customer confidence and business and have a negative impact on our financial results. We are in the process of implementing a global Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system, which we refer to as Project ONE, which will upgrade and standardize our information system. The implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years. The North America adhesives business went live in 2014, and the implementation process proved to be more difficult than we originally anticipated resulting in disruptions in our manufacturing network, lower productivity and deteriorated customer service levels. By the end of 2014, most of the problems associated with the software implementation had been remediated and the business was stable and running at capacity with productivity levels approaching the levels experienced prior to the new software implementation. In late 2014, we suspended any further implementation projects in other geographic regions until we complete the optimization of the current platform in North America. We are preparing a revised implementation plan that leverages the experiences of our first go-live event and reduces the risk of significant business interruption. We expect to start subsequent implementations in the first half of 2017 with completion of the second phase in the Latin America region expected in 2018.  Any delays or other failure to achieve our implementation goals may adversely impact our financial results. In addition, the failure to either deliver the application on time or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs could lead to business disruption and loss of business. Failure or abandonment of any part of the ERP system could result in a write-off of part or all of the costs that have been capitalized on the project.    9Table Of Contents  Risks associated with acquisitions could have an adverse effect on us and the inability to execute organizational restructuring may affect our results.  As part of our growth strategy, we have made and intend to pursue additional acquisitions of complementary businesses or products and joint ventures. The ability to grow through acquisitions or joint ventures depends upon our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate suitable acquisitions or joint venture arrangements. If we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing business, our results of operations and our cash flows could be adversely affected. Our acquisition strategy also involves other risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return on capital, unidentified issues not discovered in our investigations and evaluations of those strategies and acquisitions and difficulties implementing and maintaining consistent standards, controls, procedures, policies and systems. Future acquisitions could result in debt, dilution, liabilities, increased interest expense, restructuring charges and amortization expenses related to intangible assets. In addition, our profitability is dependent on our ability to drive sustainable productivity improvements such as cost savings through organizational restructuring. Delays or unexpected costs may prevent us from realizing the full operational and financial benefits of such restructuring initiatives and may potentially disrupt our operations.  Legal and Regulatory Risks We have lawsuits and claims against us with uncertain outcomes. Our operations from time to time are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. The results of any future litigation or settlement of such lawsuits and claims are inherently unpredictable, but such outcomes could be adverse and material in amount. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a discussion of current litigation. Costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental laws and regulations may negatively impact our operations and financial results.   We are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that impose various environmental controls on us or otherwise relate to environmental protection, the sale and export of certain chemicals or hazardous materials, and various health and safety matters.

7,FUL,FULLER (H. B.) CO,2016-01-27,"Risk Factors
 As a global manufacturer of adhesives, sealants and other specialty chemical products, we operate in a business environment that is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Below are the most significant factors that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Adverse conditions in the global economy could negatively impact our customers and therefore our financial results.  An economic downturn in the businesses or geographic areas in which we sell our products could reduce demand for these products and result in a decrease in sales volume that could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Product demand often depends on end-use markets. Economic conditions that reduce consumer confidence or discretionary spending may reduce product demand. Challenging economic conditions may also impair the ability of customers to pay for products they have purchased, and as a result, our reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. Increases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results.  In 2015, raw material costs made up over 75 percent of our cost of sales. Accordingly, changes in the cost of raw materials can significantly impact our earnings. Raw materials needed to manufacture products are obtained from a number of suppliers and many of the raw materials are petroleum and natural gas based derivatives. Under normal market conditions, these raw materials are generally available on the open market from a variety of producers. While alternate supplies of most key raw materials are available, supplier production outages may lead to strained supply-demand situations for certain raw materials. The substitution of key raw materials requires us to identify new supply sources, reformulate, retest and may require seeking re-approval from our customers using those products. From time to time, the prices and availability of these raw materials may fluctuate, which could impair our ability to procure necessary materials, or increase the cost of manufacturing products. If the prices of raw materials increase in a short period of time, we may be unable to pass these increases on to our customers in a timely manner and could experience reductions to our profit margins. Based on 2015 financial results, a hypothetical one percent change in our raw material costs would have resulted in a change in net income of approximately $7.3 million or $0.14 per diluted share. Uncertainties in foreign social, political and economic conditions and fluctuations in foreign currency may adversely affect our results.  Approximately 57 percent, or $1.2 billion, of our net revenue was generated outside the United States in 2015. International operations could be adversely affected by changes in social, political and economic conditions, especially in the Middle East, Russia, China and other developing or emerging markets where we do business. The Tonsan aquisition significantly increased our net revenue in China, thus increasing our potential exposure to changes in its social, political and economic conditions. In addition, trade protection measures, anti-bribery and anti-corruption regulations, restrictions on repatriation of earnings, differing intellectual property rights and changes in legal and regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs could adversely affect our results of operations.   7  Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could potentially result in increases or decreases in net revenue, cost of raw materials and earnings and may adversely affect the value of our assets outside the United States. In 2015 the change in foreign currencies negatively impacted our net revenue by approximately $126.0 million. In 2015 we spent approximately $1.2 billion for raw materials worldwide of which approximately $638.8 million was purchased outside the United States. Based on 2015 financial results, a hypothetical one percent change in our cost of sales due to foreign currency rate changes would have resulted in a change in net income of approximately $5.2 million or $0.10 per diluted share. Although we utilize risk management tools, including hedging, as appropriate, to mitigate market fluctuations in foreign currencies, any changes in strategy in regard to risk management tools can also affect sales revenue, expenses and results of operations and there can be no assurance that such measures will result in cost savings or that all market fluctuation exposure will be eliminated. We experience substantial competition in each of the operating segments and geographic areas in which we operate.  Our wide variety of products are sold in numerous markets, each of which is highly competitive. Our competitive position in markets is, in part, subject to external factors. For example, supply and demand for certain of our products is driven by end-use markets and worldwide capacities which, in turn, impact demand for and pricing of our products. Many of our direct competitors are part of large multinational companies and may have more resources than we do. Any increase in competition may result in lost market share or reduced prices, which could result in reduced profit margins. This may impair the ability to grow or even to maintain current levels of revenues and earnings. While we have an extensive customer base, loss of certain top customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations until such business is replaced, and no assurances can be made that we would be able to regain or replace any lost customers. Failure to develop new products and protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our future performance and growth. Ongoing innovation and product development are important factors in our competitiveness. Failure to create new products and generate new ideas could negatively impact our ability to grow and deliver strong financial results. We continually apply for and obtain U.S. and foreign patents to protect the results of our research for use in our operations and licensing. We are party to a substantial number of patent licenses and other technology agreements. We rely on patents, confidentiality agreements and internal security measures to protect our intellectual property. Failure to protect this intellectual property could negatively affect our future performance and growth. We may be required to record impairment charges on our long-lived assets. Weak demand may cause underutilization of our manufacturing capacity or elimination of product lines; contract terminations or customer shutdowns may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment; or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific product or customer events may require us to record an impairment on tangible assets, such as facilities and equipment, as well as intangible assets, such as intellectual property or goodwill, which would have a negative impact on our financial results. We have lawsuits and claims against us with uncertain outcomes. Our operations from time to time are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. The results of any future litigation or settlement of such lawsuits and claims are inherently unpredictable, but such outcomes could be adverse and material in amount. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a discussion of current litigation. Costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental laws and regulations may negatively impact our operations and financial results.  We are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that impose various environmental controls on us or otherwise relate to environmental protection, the sale and export of certain chemicals or hazardous materials, and various health and safety matters. The costs of complying with these laws and regulations can be significant and may increase as applicable requirements and their enforcement become more stringent and new rules are implemented. Adverse developments and/or periodic settlements could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a discussion of current environmental matters.  8  Additional income tax expense or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a negative impact on our financial results. We are subject to income tax laws and regulations in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions.  Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes.  Our income tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions.  Our income tax provision and income tax liabilities could be adversely affected by the jurisdictional mix of earnings, changes in valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and regulations.  In the ordinary course of our business, we are also subject to continuous examinations of our income tax returns by tax authorities.  Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final results of any tax examination or related litigation could be materially different from our related historical income tax provisions and accruals.  Adverse developments in an audit, examination, litigation related to previously filed tax returns, or in the relevant jurisdiction’s tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles and interpretations could have a material effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods.   Distressed financial markets may result in dramatic deflation of asset valuations and a general disruption in capital markets.  Adverse equity market conditions and volatility in the credit markets could have a negative impact on the value of our pension trust assets and our future estimated pension liabilities, and other postretirement benefit plans. In addition, we could be required to provide increased pension plan funding. As a result, our financial results could be negatively impacted. Reduced access to capital markets may affect our ability to invest in strategic growth initiatives such as acquisitions. In addition, the reduced credit availability could limit our customers’ ability to invest in their businesses, refinance maturing debt obligations, or meet their ongoing working capital needs. If these customers do not have sufficient access to the financial markets, demand for our products may decline. Catastrophic events could disrupt our operations or the operations of our suppliers or customers, having a negative impact on our financial results. Unexpected events, including natural disasters and severe weather events, fires or explosions at our facilities or those of our suppliers, acts of war or terrorism, supply disruptions or breaches of security of our information technology systems could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm our operations, our customers and our suppliers. Such events could reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers and deliver products to our customers. A failure in our information technology systems could negatively impact our business. We rely on information technology to record and process transactions, manage our business and maintain the financial accuracy of our records. Our computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from various sources, including power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, vandalism, catastrophic events and human error. Interruptions of our computer systems could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of business and cause us to incur additional expense. Information technology security threats are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Our information technology systems could be breached by unauthorized outside parties or misused by employees or other insiders intent on extracting sensitive information, corrupting information or disrupting business processes. Such unauthorized access could compromise confidential information, disrupt our business, harm our reputation, result in the loss of assets, customer confidence and business and have a negative impact on our financial results. We are in the process of implementing a global Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, which we refer to as Project ONE, that will upgrade and standardize our information system. The implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years. The North America adhesives business went live in 2014, and the implementation process proved to be more difficult than we originally anticipated resulting in disruptions in our manufacturing network, lower productivity and deteriorated customer service levels. By the end of 2014, most of the problems associated with the software implementation had been remediated and the business was stable and running at capacity with productivity levels approaching the levels experienced prior to the new software implementation. In late 2014, we suspended any further implementation projects in other geographic regions until we complete the optimization of the current platform in North America. We are preparing a revised implementation plan that leverages the experiences of our first go-live event and reduces the risk of significant business interruption. We expect to start subsequent implementations in the second half of 2016 with completion of the second phase expected in early 2017.   9  Any delays or other failure to achieve our implementation goals may adversely impact our financial results. In addition, the failure to either deliver the application on time or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs could lead to business disruption and loss of business. Failure or abandonment of any part of the ERP system could result in a write-off of part or all of the costs that have been capitalized on the project.  The inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could adversely impact our business. Sustaining and growing our business depends on the recruitment, development and retention of qualified employees. The inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations. The inability to make or effectively integrate future acquisitions may affect our results.  As part of our growth strategy, we intend to pursue additional acquisitions of complementary businesses or products and joint ventures. The ability to grow through acquisitions or joint ventures depends upon our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate suitable acquisitions or joint venture arrangements. If we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing business, our results of operations and our cash flows could be adversely affected. "

  As a global manufacturer of adhesives, sealants, paints and other specialty chemical products, we operate in a business environment that is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Below are the mostsignificant factors that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Adverse conditions in theglobal economy could negatively impact our customers and therefore our financial results.  An economic downturn in the businesses orgeographic areas in which we sell our products could reduce demand for these products and result in a decrease in sales volume that could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Product demand often depends on end-use markets. Economicconditions that reduce consumer confidence or discretionary spending may reduce product demand. Challenging economic conditions may also impair the ability of customers to pay for products they have purchased, and as a result, our reserves fordoubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase.  Increases in prices and declines in the availability of rawmaterials could negatively impact our financial results.  Raw materials needed to manufacture products are obtained from a number ofsuppliers and many of the raw materials are petroleum-based derivatives, minerals and metals. Under normal market conditions, these raw materials are generally available on the open market from a variety of producers. While alternate supplies ofmost key raw materials are available, supplier production outages may lead to strained supply-demand situations for certain raw materials. The substitution of key raw materials requires us to identify new supply sources, reformulate, retest and mayrequire seeking re-approval from our customers using those products. From time to time, the prices and availability of these raw materials may fluctuate, which could impair our ability to procure necessary materials, or increase the cost ofmanufacturing products. If the prices of raw materials increase in a short period of time, we may be unable to pass these increases on to our customers in a timely manner and could experience reductions to our profit margins. Uncertainties in foreign political and economic conditions and fluctuations in foreign currency may adversely affect our results. Approximately 61 percent, or $944 million, of our net revenue was generated outside the United States in 2011. International operations could be adverselyaffected by changes in political and economic conditions, trade protection measures, restrictions on repatriation of earnings, differing intellectual property rights and changes in regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products orincrease costs. Also, fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could potentially result in increases or decreases in earnings and may adversely affect the value of our assets outside the United States. Although weutilize risk management tools, including hedging, as appropriate, to mitigate market fluctuations in foreign currencies, any changes in strategy in regard to risk management tools can also affect sales revenue, expenses and results of operations andthere can be no assurance that such measures will result in cost savings or that all market fluctuation exposure will be eliminated.   7 Table of ContentsWe experience substantial competition in each of the operating segments and geographic areas in which weoperate.

The inability to recruit and retain keypersonnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations.  The pending acquisition of the global industrialadhesives business of Forbo Group may present certain risks to our business and operations both before and after completion of the acquisition.  On December 21, 2011, we entered into a Master Purchase Agreement to acquire Forbos global industrial adhesives business (the target business). We or our designated subsidiaries will purchaseForbos subsidiaries that operate the business and will directly purchase certain assets used in the business that are not owned by such subsidiaries. We will pay Forbo 370 million Swiss Francs, or approximately $394 million to purchasethe business on a cash-free and debt-free basis. The purchase price will be paid in cash at closing. We have committed bridge financing in place to complete the transaction and intend to arrange permanent financing through a private placement andsyndicated bank loan markets prior to closing.  Our board of directors and Forbos board of directors have separately approved theacquisition subject to customary closing conditions including the absence of a material adverse change to the business and regulatory approvals. The transaction is expected to close as soon as March 2012. This pending acquisition presents certain risks to our business and operations prior to the closing of the acquisition, including, among other things,risks that:      the acquisition is subject to the expiration or termination of waiting periods and receipt of clearances or approvals from various regulatoryauthorities, which may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on us or, if not obtained, could prevent completion of the acquisition;      any delay in completing the acquisition will delay the realization of the benefits expected to be achieved thereafter;     any delay in completing the acquisition could adversely affect the future business and operations of the target business;     uncertainties associated with the acquisition may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees which could adversely affect the futurebusiness and operations of the target business;      we may encounter difficulty or high costs associated with securing permanent financing;     if the acquisition is not completed by October 6, 2012, we or Forbo may choose not to proceed with the acquisition. In addition, certain risks will continue to exist after the closing of the acquisition, including, among other things, risks that:     the mix of markets served and business operations of Forbo differ somewhat from our markets and our business operations, and the combined business willhave a different business mix than our business prior to the acquisition, presenting different operational risks and challenges;   9 Table of Contents   we may be unable to integrate successfully the business of Forbo and realize the anticipated benefits of the merger;     we will have substantial indebtedness following the acquisition and our future credit ratings or our subsidiaries credit ratings may be different fromwhat we currently expect;      the acquisition integration may involve unexpected costs, unexpected liabilities or unexpected delays;     our business may suffer as a result of uncertainty surrounding the acquisition and disruptions from the acquisition may harm relationships withcustomers, suppliers and employees;      evaluation of, and estimation of potential losses arising from lawsuits, claims, contingencies and legal proceedings could prove to be inaccurate"

Also, changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could potentially resultin increases or decreases in earnings and may adversely affect the value of the companys assets outside the United States. Although the company utilizes risk management tools, including hedging, as appropriate, to mitigate market fluctuationsin foreign currencies, any changes in strategy in regard to risk management tools can also affect sales revenue, expenses and results of operations and there can be no assurance that such measures will result in cost savings or that all marketfluctuation exposure will be eliminated.    Raw Materials: Raw materials neededto manufacture products are obtained from a number of suppliers. Many of these raw materials are petroleum-based derivatives, minerals and metals. Under normal market conditions, these materials are generally available on the open market from avariety of producers. From time to time, however, the prices and availability of these raw materials fluctuate, which could impair the ability to procure necessary materials, or increase the cost of manufacturing products. If the prices of rawmaterials increase, the company may be unable to pass these increases on to its customers and could experience reductions to its profit margins. Raw material prices can increase in a shorter period of time than the company is able to adjust sellingprices to its customer base, which may reduce the companys profit margins.   5 Table of ContentsLitigation: The companys operations from time to time are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims,investigations, and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended inthe ordinary course of business. While the company is unable to predict the outcome of these matters, it does not believe, based upon currently available information, that the ultimate resolution of any pending matter will have a material adverseeffect on its long-term financial condition. However, adverse developments and/or periodic settlements could negatively impact the companys results of operations or cash flows in one or more future quarters. See Item 3. Legal Proceedingsfor a discussion of current litigation.    Environmental: The company is subjectto numerous environmental laws and regulations that impose various environmental controls on the company or otherwise relate to environmental protection, the sale and export of certain chemicals or hazardous materials, and various health and safetymatters. Expenditures related to environmental matters have not had, and, based on currently available information, are not expected to have, a material adverse effect on the companys long-term financial condition. However, adversedevelopments and/or periodic settlements could negatively impact the companys results of operations or cash flows in one or more future quarters. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a discussion of current environmental matters.   Economic: Substantial deterioration in economic conditions, especially in the UnitedStates and Europe, have had and may continue to have negative effects on the companys results of operations and cash flows. The economic conditions affect the companys sales volumes, pricing levels and overall profitability. Demand formany of the companys products depends on end-use markets. Economic conditions that reduce consumer confidence or discretionary spending may reduce demand for the companys products. Challenging economic conditions may also impair theability of customers to pay for products they have purchased, and as a result, the companys reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase.    Capital Markets: Distressed financial markets in 2008 have resulted in dramatic deflation of asset valuations and a general disruption incapital markets. This disruption has resulted in diminished liquidity and credit availability. There can be no assurance that government actions will have a positive impact on the capital markets. Reduced access to capital markets may affect thecompanys ability to invest in strategic growth initiatives such as acquisitions. In addition, the reduced credit availability may affect the companys customers from investing in their businesses, refinancing maturing debt obligations, ormeeting their ongoing working capital needs. If these customers do not have sufficient access to the financial markets, demand for the companys products may decline.    Additional factors that could affect future results include: (i) economic matters over which the company has no control, including changes ininflation, tax rates, and interest rates; (ii) changes in fiscal, governmental and other regulatory policies; (iii) the loss or insolvency of a major customer or distributor; (iv) natural or manmade disasters (including material actsof terrorism or hostilities that impact the companys markets); (v) loss of, or changes in, executive management; and (vi) changes in accounting standards that are adverse to the company. In addition, the company notes that its stockprice can be affected by fluctuations in quarterly earnings.   "
