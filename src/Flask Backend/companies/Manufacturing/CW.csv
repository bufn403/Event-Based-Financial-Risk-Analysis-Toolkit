.We have summarized the known, material risks to our business below. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely impacted if any of these risks materialize. Additional risk factors not currently known to us or that we believe are immaterial may also impair our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows, and require significant management time and attention. The risk factors below should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as other required filings by us to the Securities Exchange Commission, such as our Form 10-Q’s, Form 8-K’s, proxy statements for our annual shareholder meetings, and subsequent amendments, if any.RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONSIntrusion on our systems could damage our business.We store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, and confidential employee information on our servers and databases. As a result, we are increasingly dependent upon our information systems to operate our business. Our ability to effectively manage our business depends on the security, reliability, and adequacy of our information systems. In addition, various privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations, both in the U.S. and globally, require us to manage and protect sensitive and confidential information, including personal data of our employees, from disclosure. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective in May 2018, extends the scope of the European Union data protection laws to all companies processing data of European Union residents, regardless of the company’s location. Additionally, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, additional costs to comply with increased cybersecurity protections for our customers, including the U.S. government. Despite our implementation of firewalls, switchgear, and other network security measures, our servers, databases, and other systems may be vulnerable to various cyber and other security threats, including those caused by computer hackers, physical or electronic break-ins, sabotage, computer viruses, malware, worms, and similar disruptions from unauthorized access and tampering with our computer systems, including through social engineering such as phishing attacks, coordinated denial-of-service attacks, and similar incidents. The occurrence of some of these risks may be increased due to the work-from-home arrangements that we have implemented for many of our office-based employees. We continue to review and enhance our computer systems as well as provide training to our employees in an attempt to prevent unauthorized and unlawful intrusions. However, it is possible that we may not be able to prevent all intrusions. Such intrusions could result in our network security or computer systems being compromised and possibly result in the misappropriation or corruption of sensitive information, including intellectual property, or cause disruptions in our services. While we carry cyber insurance, we still may be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against, remediate, or alleviate problems caused by such intrusions. Any such intrusion could cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subject us to legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Potential product liability risks exist from the products that we sell.We may be exposed to liabilities for personal injury, death, or property damage due to the failure of a product that we have sold. We typically agree to indemnify our customers against certain liabilities resulting from the products we sell, and any third-party indemnification we seek from our suppliers and our liability insurance may not fully cover our indemnification obligations to customers. We may also not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Any liability for which third-party indemnification is not available and not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, the failure of a product that we have sold could also result in a recall of, or safety alert relating to, such product which could ultimately result, in certain cases, in the removal of such product from the marketplace and claims regarding costs associated therewith. Furthermore, an accident caused by one of our products could damage our reputation for selling quality products. We believe that our customers consider safety and reliability as key criteria in selecting our products and believe that our reputation for quality assurance is a significant competitive strength. If an accident were to be caused by one of our products, or if we were to 11otherwise fail to maintain a satisfactory record of safety and reliability, our ability to retain and attract customers may be materially adversely affected.We are subject to liability under warranty obligations.The majority of our contracts contain provisions which expose us to potential liability for warranty claims made by customers or third parties with respect to products that have been designed, manufactured, or serviced by us or our suppliers. While we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain liability claims, that insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all claims that may arise, or we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Material product warranty obligations not covered by insurance or that exceed our established reserves could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our earnings and margins depend in part on subcontractor performance, as well as raw material and component availability and pricing.Our businesses depend on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials and components. At times subcontractors perform services that we provide to our customers. Our supply chain has been and may continue to be impacted by a wide variety of factors, including labor and material shortages as well as geopolitical events, such as China’s relationship with the United States and Taiwan. Because we strive to limit the volume of raw materials and component parts on hand, our business could be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain these raw materials and components from our suppliers in the quantities that we require. We also depend on subcontractors and suppliers to meet their contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements. Nonperformance or underperformance by subcontractors and suppliers could materially impact our ability to perform obligations to our customers, which could result in a customer terminating our contract for default, expose us to liability, and substantially impair our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. Generally, raw materials and purchased components are available from a number of different suppliers, though several suppliers are our sole source of certain components. If a sole-source supplier is delayed or should cease or otherwise be unable to deliver such components, we may not be able to produce the related product in a timely manner or in sufficient quantities, if at all, which could adversely affect our operating results. A sole-source supplier of a key component could also potentially exert significant bargaining power over price, quality, warranty claims, or other terms relating to these materials, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, supply chain constraints and improving economic conditions have resulted in sustained increases in the prices we pay for many of the components and raw materials used in our products. Furthermore, we are experiencing higher labor costs due to increased competition for personnel in many regions in which we operate as well as general inflationary conditions, including higher shipping costs, labor shortages, and rising energy prices. Our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor may be adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers is unable to provide the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner. While we have attempted to mitigate the effects of increased costs through price increases, there are no assurances that higher prices can effectively be passed through to our customers, or that we will be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw materials costs through price increases on a timely basis.Our business involves risks associated with complex manufacturing processes.Our manufacturing processes depend on certain sophisticated and high-value equipment. Unexpected failures of this equipment may result in production delays, revenue loss, and significant repair costs. In addition, equipment failures could result in injuries to our employees. Moreover, the competitive nature of our businesses requires us to continuously implement process changes intended to achieve product improvements and manufacturing efficiencies. These process changes may at times result in production delays, quality concerns, and increased costs. Any disruption of operations at our facilities due to equipment failures or process interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business.RISKS RELATED TO OUR STRATEGYImplementing our acquisition strategy involves risks, and our failure to successfully implement this strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business.As part of our capital allocation strategy, we aim to grow our business by selectively pursuing acquisitions and technologies that supplement our organic growth. We are continuing to actively pursue additional acquisition opportunities, some of which may be material to our business and financial performance. Although we have been successful with this strategy in the past, we may not be able to grow our business in the future through acquisitions for several reasons, including:12•Encountering difficulties identifying and executing acquisitions; •Increased competition for targets, which may increase acquisition costs;•Consolidation in our industry, reducing the number of acquisition targets;•Competition laws and regulations preventing us from making certain acquisitions; and•Acquisition financing not being available on acceptable terms, or at all.In addition, there are potential risks associated with growing our business through acquisitions, including the failure to successfully integrate and realize the expected benefits of an acquisition. For example, with any past or future acquisition, there is the possibility that:•The business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture;•Technological and product synergies, economies of scale, or cost reductions may not occur as expected;•Management may be distracted from overseeing existing operations by the need to integrate acquired businesses;•We may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities;•We may experience unforeseen difficulties in integrating operations and systems;•We may fail to retain or assimilate employees of the acquired business;•We may experience problems in retaining customers or integrating customer bases; •We may experience increased capital requirements; •There could be insufficient internal controls over financial activities or financial reporting at an acquired company that could impact us on a consolidated basis; and•We may encounter difficulties in entering new markets in which we may have little or no experience.While we conduct financial and other due diligence in connection with our acquisitions and generally seek some form of protection, such as indemnification from the seller, insurance coverage, and sometimes placing a portion of the purchase price in escrow or a cash holdback to cover potential liabilities, such acquired companies may have weaknesses or liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition. Further, indemnities, insurance or escrow/holdback arrangements may not fully cover such matters and acquisitions of public companies typically do not include post-closing indemnities or escrows.Failure to successfully implement our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop new technologies.Virtually all products produced and sold by us are highly engineered and require sophisticated manufacturing and system-integration techniques and capabilities. The commercial and government markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies. In addition, product and program needs of our government and commercial customers change and evolve regularly. Accordingly, to remain competitive in the future, we will need to continue to invest financial resources, including through internal research and development, acquisitions, or other teaming arrangements, to: (a) identify emerging technological trends in our current and target markets; (b) develop and manufacture competitive products, systems, and services; (c) enhance our offerings by adding technological innovations that differentiate our products, systems, and services from those of our competitors; and (d) develop, manufacture, and bring those products, systems, and service to market quickly at cost-effective prices. These expenditures could divert our attention and resources from other projects, and we cannot be sure that these expenditures will ultimately lead to the timely development of new offerings and technologies or identification of and expansion into new markets. Due to the design complexity of our products, we may, in the future, experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products. Any delays could result in increased costs of development or deflect resources from other projects. In addition, there can be no assurance that the market for our products will develop or continue to expand or that we will be successful in newly identified markets as we currently anticipate.We operate in highly competitive markets.Many of our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets, and are affected by varying degrees of competition, including competition for hiring and retaining skilled labor. We compete against companies that often have higher sales volumes and greater financial, technological, research and development, human, and marketing resources than we have. These companies may also price their products and services below our selling prices, which could exert downward pressure on our product pricing and margins. As a result, they may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns. In addition, some of our largest customers could develop the capability to manufacture products or provide services similar to products that we manufacture or services that we provide. This would result in these customers supplying their own products or 13services and competing directly with us for sales of these products or services, all of which could significantly reduce our revenues. Furthermore, we are facing increased international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition. If consolidation of our competition continues to occur, we would expect the competitive pressures we face to increase. Our management believes that the principal points of competition in our markets are technology, price, product quality, product performance, sufficient supply of necessary components, technical expertise, timeliness of delivery, superior customer service and support, and continued certification under customer quality requirements and assurance programs. If we are unable to compete successfully with existing or new competitors in these areas, we may experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.We may be unable to protect the value of our intellectual property.Obtaining, maintaining, and enforcing our intellectual property rights and avoiding infringing on the intellectual property rights of others are important factors to the operation of our business. While we take precautionary steps to protect our technological advantages and intellectual property and rely in part on patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright laws, we cannot assure that the precautionary steps we have taken will completely protect our intellectual property rights. Because patent applications in the United States are maintained in secrecy until either the patent application is published or a patent is issued, we may not be aware of third-party patents, patent applications, and other intellectual property relevant to our products that may block our use of our intellectual property or may be used in third-party products that compete with our products and processes. When others infringe on our intellectual property rights, the value of our products is diminished, and we may incur substantial litigation costs to enforce our rights. Similarly, we may incur substantial litigation costs and the obligation to pay royalties if others claim we infringed on their intellectual property rights. When we develop intellectual property and technologies with funding from U.S. Government contracts, the government has the royalty-free right to use that property.In addition to our patent rights, we also rely on unpatented technology, trade secrets, and confidential information. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques or otherwise gain access to or disclose our technology. We may not be able to protect our rights in unpatented technology, trade secrets, and confidential information effectively. We generally require each of our employees and consultants to execute a confidentiality agreement at the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us. There is no guarantee that we will succeed in obtaining and retaining executed agreements from all employees or consultants. Moreover, these agreements may not provide effective protection of our information or, in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure, they may not provide adequate remedies.RISKS RELATED TO MARKET CONDITIONSA substantial portion of our revenues and earnings depends upon the continued willingness of the U.S. Government and other customers in the defense industry to buy our products and services.In 2023, approximately 46% of our total net sales were derived from or related to U.S. defense programs. U.S. defense spending has historically been cyclical, and defense budgets tend to rise when perceived threats to national security increase the level of concern over the country’s safety. At other times, spending by the military can decrease. In August 2011, Congress enacted the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA), which imposed spending caps and certain reductions in defense spending over a ten-year period through 2021. These spending caps and reductions, referred to as sequestration, went into effect in March 2013. Through a series of bipartisan agreements, Congress has been able to temporarily lift discretionary spending limits every year through 2019. On August 2, 2019, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 (BBA) was signed into law, which raised the BCA budget caps for both defense and non-defense discretionary spending in 2020 and 2021 and extended the mandatory BCA spending reductions through 2029. Absent additional legislative or other remedial action, the sequestration could require reduced U.S. federal government spending through fiscal 2029. As a result of this uncertainty, a decrease in U.S. Government defense spending or changes in spending allocation could result in one or more of our programs being reduced, delayed, or terminated. In the event that one or more of our programs are reduced, delayed, or terminated for which we provide products and services, we may experience a reduction in our revenues and earnings and a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.U.S. lawmakers on several occasions have passed legislation to raise the federal debt ceiling, including the most recent suspension to the federal debt ceiling in June 2023, which is expected to allow the U.S. government to cover its debt obligations until at least January 1, 2025. Failure by Congress to further suspend or increase the debt ceiling could delay or result in the loss of contracts for the procurement of our products and services, and we may be asked or required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. government contracts, even if the U.S. government is unable to make timely payments.A downturn in the aircraft market could adversely affect our business.14Our sales to large commercial aircraft manufacturers are cyclical in nature, and can be adversely affected by a number of factors, including current and future passenger traffic levels, increasing fuel and labor costs, environmental concerns (inclusive of climate change), intense price competition, the retirement of older aircraft, regulatory changes, outbreak of infectious disease such as COVID-19, terrorist attacks, geopolitical events, conflicts and wars (including the Russia-Ukraine war and the Hamas-Israel war), general economic conditions (including cost inflation), worldwide airline profits, and backlog levels, all of which can be unpredictable and are outside our control. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic drastically reduced air traffic as travel restrictions and social distancing measures were implemented to help control the spread of the virus. The reduced air traffic applied financial pressures on airlines, who, in order to preserve cash and liquidity, dramatically reduced flight hours and delayed the purchases of new aircraft. Furthermore, as companies and employees become accustomed to working remotely, there is a risk that business travel and the associated flight hours may not fully reach pre-pandemic levels. Any decrease in demand resulting from a downturn in the aerospace market could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our backlog is subject to reduction and cancellation, which could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.Backlog represents products or services that our customers have contractually committed to purchase from us. Total backlog includes both funded (unfilled orders for which funding is authorized, appropriated, and contractually obligated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated and/or contractually obligated by the customer). We are a subcontractor to prime contractors for the vast majority of our government business. As such, substantially all amounts in backlog are funded. Backlog excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering type contracts (e.g. Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity). Backlog is adjusted for changes in foreign exchange rates and is reduced for contract cancellations and terminations in the period in which they occur. Backlog as of December 31, 2023 was $2.9 billion. Backlog is subject to fluctuations and is not necessarily indicative of future sales. The timing of backlog may be impacted by project delays. The U.S. Government may unilaterally modify or cancel its contracts. In addition, under certain of our commercial contracts, our customers may unilaterally modify or terminate their orders at any time for their convenience. Accordingly, certain portions of our backlog can be cancelled or reduced at the option of the U.S. Government and commercial customers. Our failure to replace cancelled or reduced backlog could negatively impact our results of operations.As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to numerous procurement rules and regulations.We must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business. These regulations and other requirements regularly evolve, and new laws, regulations or procurement requirements or changes to current ones could significantly increase our costs and risks and reduce our profitability.  For example, changes to the FAR requirements for federal contractors proposed in November 2022 would require companies to make disclosure of annual greenhouse gas emissions and other disclosures to be deemed a responsible bidder on future government contracts. Such additional requirements could result in additional expense. A violation of specific laws and regulations could also result in the imposition of fines and penalties, the termination of our contracts, or debarment from bidding on contracts. These fines and penalties could be imposed for example, by failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards, receiving or paying kickbacks, or filing false claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to audits, reviews, and investigations by government agencies. The failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation. It could also result in our progress payments being withheld. In some instances, these laws and regulations impose terms or rights that are more favorable to the government than those typically available to commercial parties in negotiated transactions. For example, the U.S. Government may terminate any of our government contracts and, in general, subcontracts, at its convenience as well as for default based on performance. Upon termination for convenience of a fixed-price type contract, we normally are entitled to receive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement for allowable costs for work-in-process, and an allowance for profit on work actually completed on the contract or adjustment for loss if completion of performance would have resulted in a loss. Upon termination for convenience of a cost reimbursement contract, we normally are entitled to reimbursement of allowable costs plus a portion of the fee. Such allowable costs would normally include our cost to terminate agreements with our suppliers and subcontractors. The amount of the fee recovered, if any, is related to the portion of the work accomplished prior to termination and is determined by negotiation.A termination arising out of our default could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. In addition, on those contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor, the U.S. Government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor, irrespective of the quality of our services as a subcontractor.15Our U.S. Government contracts typically span one or more base years and multiple option years. The U.S. Government generally has the right to not exercise option periods and may not exercise an option period if the agency is not satisfied with our performance on the contract or does not receive funding to continue the program. U.S. Government procurement may adversely affect our cash flow or program profitability.Furthermore, we are subject to other risks in connection with government contracts, including without limitation:•the frequent need to bid on programs prior to completing the necessary design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and/or cost overruns;•the difficulty in forecasting long-term costs and schedules and the potential obsolescence of products related to long-term, fixed price contracts;•contracts with varying fixed terms that may not be renewed or followed by follow-on contracts upon expiration;•cancellation of the follow-on production phase of contracts if program requirements are not met in the development phase; and•the fact that government contract wins can be contested by other contractors.Our operations are subject to numerous domestic and international laws, regulations, and restrictions. Noncompliance with these laws, regulations, and restrictions could expose us to fines, penalties, suspension, or debarment, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and overall financial condition.We have contracts and operations in many parts of the world subject to United States and foreign laws and regulations, including the False Claims Act, regulations relating to import-export control (including the International Traffic in Arms Regulation promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act), sanctions programs implemented by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of Treasury, technology transfer restrictions, repatriation of earnings, exchange controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act, and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act. Although we have implemented policies and procedures and provided training that we believe are sufficient to address these risks, we cannot guarantee that our operations will always comply with these laws and regulations. From time to time, we may file voluntary disclosure reports with the U.S. Department of State, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Commerce regarding certain violations of U.S. export control laws and regulations discovered by us in the course of our business activities, employee training, or internal reviews and audits. To date, our voluntary disclosures have not resulted in a fine, penalty, or export privilege denial or restriction that has had a material adverse impact on our financial condition or ability to export. Our failure, or failure by our sales representatives or consultants to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities and could, in the extreme case, result in suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.The airline industry is heavily regulated, and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements, our results of operations could suffer.Governmental agencies throughout the world, including the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the European Aviation Safety Agency, prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components, including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although compliance with FAA requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries. We include documentation with our products sold to aircraft manufacturing customers certifying that each part complies with applicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. In order to sell our products, we as well as the products that we manufacture must also be certified by our individual OEM customers. If any of the material authorizations or approvals qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended, then the sale of such product would be prohibited by law, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.From time to time, the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations, which are usually more stringent than existing regulations. If these proposed regulations are adopted and enacted, we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.We are subject to liability under environmental and health and safety laws and regulations.Our business and facilities are subject to numerous federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to the use, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials and other waste products used in the manufacturing of certain of our products or providing certain of our services, and we are subject to potentially significant fines or penalties, 16including criminal sanctions, as well as facility shutdowns to address violations, and may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit emissions or discharges. We may also be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future, particularly as greenhouse gas emissions and climate change regulations and initiatives increase. Regulatory bodies may decide in the future to limit or ban certain materials we use in our manufacturing process due to potentially significant health and safety risks to people or the environment. Such limitations or bans may in the future require us to consider, the use of alternative raw materials or changes to our method of operations. Such alternatives often require customer approval and may result in additional costs, including higher raw material expenses, changes in operational methods, and additional customer qualifications. The formulation changes could also impact the utility of our products.Environmental laws generally impose liability for investigation, remediation, and removal of hazardous materials and other waste products on property owners and those who dispose of materials at waste sites, whether or not the waste was disposed of legally at the time in question. We are currently addressing environmental remediation at certain current and former facilities, and we have been named as a potentially responsible party along with other organizations in a number of environmental clean-up sites and may be named in connection with future sites. We are required to contribute to the costs of the investigation and remediation and to establish reserves in our financial statements for future costs deemed probable and estimable. Although we have estimated and reserved for future environmental remediation costs, the final resolution of these liabilities may significantly vary from our estimates and could potentially have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. We are also subject to federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations governing worker health and safety requirements. Failing to comply with these laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our operating results.We may be subject to periodic litigation and regulatory proceedings, which may adversely affect our business and financial performance.From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions brought or threatened against us in the ordinary course of business. These actions and proceedings may involve claims for, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, workers’ compensation, employment discrimination, or breach of contract. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such actions or proceedings. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify, as plaintiffs may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts in these types of lawsuits, and the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. In addition, plaintiffs in many types of actions may seek punitive damages, civil penalties, consequential damages or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. These proceedings could result in substantial cost and may require us to devote substantial resources to defend ourselves and distract our management from the operation of our business. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses. The ultimate resolution of these matters through settlement, mediation, or court judgment could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by climate change regulations.Climate change regulations at the federal, state, or local level or in international jurisdictions could require us to limit emissions, change our manufacturing processes, obtain substitute materials which may cost more or be less available, increase our investment in control technology for greenhouse gas emissions, fund offset projects, or undertake other costly activities. These regulations could significantly increase our costs and restrict our manufacturing operations by virtue of requirements for new equipment. New permits may be required for our current operations, or expansions thereof. Failure to timely receive permits could result in fines, suspension of production, or cessation of operations at one or more facilities. In addition, restrictions on carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas emissions could result in significant costs such as higher energy costs and the passing down of carbon taxes, emission cap and trade programs, and renewable portfolio standards by utility companies. The cost of complying, or of failing to comply, with these and other climate change and emissions regulations could have an adverse effect on our operating results.Increasing focus on environmental, social, and governance responsibility may impose additional costs on us and expose us to new risks.Regulators, stockholders, and other interested constituencies have focused increasingly on corporate responsibility, specifically related to the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) or sustainability practices of companies, including climate change, over the past few years, and expectations in this area are rapidly evolving. The criteria used to evaluate ESG practices may continue to evolve, which could result in greater expectations and may cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy new 17criteria and abide by any new disclosure requirements. Some investors have used, and may continue to use, ESG criteria to guide their investment strategies, and may not invest in us, or divest their holdings of us, if they believe our policies relating to ESG matters are inadequate. Our customers may also require us to implement environmental, social, or governance responsibility procedures or standards before they continue to do business with us. Additionally, we may face reputational challenges if our ESG procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by certain constituencies, which are often inconsistent in approach. Furthermore, from time to time, we may communicate certain initiatives or goals regarding ESG matters. Although we intend to meet these commitments, we may be required to expend significant resources to do so, which could increase our operational costs. Further, there can be no assurance of the extent to which any of our commitments will be achieved, if at all. In addition, we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals or perceived as not acting responsibly in connection with these matters. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.RISKS RELATED TO FINANCIAL MATTERSPolitical and economic changes in foreign countries and markets, including foreign currency fluctuations, may have a material effect on our operating results.During 2023, approximately 28% of our total net sales were to customers outside of the United States. Additionally, we also have operating facilities located in foreign countries. Doing business in foreign countries is subject to numerous risks, including without limitation: (a) political and economic instability and potential for social unrest; (b) the uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases; (c) restrictions on the repatriation of funds;  (d) restrictive trade policies; (e) tariff regulations; (f) difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses; (g) government financed competition; (h) changes in the local labor-relations climate; (i) economic conditions in local markets, including changes in inflation; (j) health concerns (including COVID-19 or any of its variants); (k) complying with foreign regulatory and tax requirements that are subject to change; and (l) limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies.  For example, in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the United States, along with the European Union, have imposed restrictive sanctions on Russia, Russian entities, and Russian citizens. We are subject to these governmental sanctions and export controls, which may subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws. Further, implementation of new tariff schemes by various governments, such as those implemented by the United States and China in recent years, could potentially increase the costs of our materials, increase our cost of production, and ultimately increase the landed cost of our products sold from one country into another country. While these factors or the impact of these factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations. There has been, and may continue to be, significant volatility in global stock markets and foreign currency exchange rates that could result in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business. To the extent that foreign sales are transacted in foreign currencies and we do not enter into currency hedge transactions, we are exposed to risk of losses due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly for the British Pound, Euro, and Canadian dollar.  Significant fluctuations in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our cash flows and financial condition. Our business operates in many locations under government jurisdictions that impose income taxes. Changes in domestic or foreign income tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or lower income tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain revenues or the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability. In both 2021 and 2022, the Biden administration announced, and in certain cases has enacted, several tax proposals to fund new government investments in infrastructure, healthcare, and education, among others. Certain of these proposals involve an increase in the domestic corporate tax rate, which if implemented could have a material impact on our future results of operations and cash flows. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) was signed into law, with tax provisions primarily focused on implementing a 15% minimum tax on global adjusted financial statement income and a 1% excise tax on share repurchases. Certain provisions of the IRA became effective in the beginning of fiscal 2023. We have evaluated the impact of the IRA on our business and deem it to be immaterial. Further, changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions where we operate could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). In December 2022, the European Union (EU) member states reached an agreement to implement the minimum tax component (Pillar Two) of the OECD’s tax reform initiative with certain aspects effective January 1, 2024, and other aspects effective January 1, 2025. While it is uncertain whether the U.S. will enact legislation to adopt Pillar Two, legislative changes to address Pillar Two are being adopted by taxing authorities in 18other countries where we do business.  Based on the Corporation’s preliminary assessments, it does not expect Pillar Two to have a material impact on its effective tax rate nor on its consolidated results of operation, financial position, and cash flows. Furthermore, the amount of income taxes paid by us is subject to examination by U.S. federal, state, and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from such examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of any such examinations. If the ultimate determination of our taxes owed were for an amount in excess of amounts reserved, our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.We use estimates when accounting for contracts that apply over-time revenue recognition. Changes in estimates could affect our profitability and overall financial position.Accounting for contracts that apply over-time revenue recognition requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract net sales and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total net sales and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. For example, assumptions must be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract, as costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials and allocated fixed costs. Similarly, assumptions must be made regarding the future impact of efficiency initiatives and cost reduction efforts. Incentives, awards, price escalations, liquidated damages, or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates using either the expected value method or most likely amount method. It is possible that materially different amounts could be obtained, because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, if different assumptions were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances, or estimates may have a material adverse effect upon future period financial reporting and performance. See “Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.Our future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairment charges.As of December 31, 2023, we had goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of approximately $2.1 billion, which represented approximately 46% of our total assets. Our goodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis, or more frequently, whenever events and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. Intangible assets (other than goodwill) are generally amortized over the useful life of such assets. In addition, from time to time, we may acquire or make an investment in a business that will require us to record goodwill based on the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the acquired assets. We may subsequently experience unforeseen issues with such business that adversely affect the anticipated returns of the business or value of the intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets for such business. For example, if the financial performance of such business was to decline significantly, we could incur a material non-cash charge to our income statement for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets. Future determinations of significant write-offs of goodwill or intangible assets as a result of an impairment test or any accelerated amortization of other intangible assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.Our current debt, and debt we may incur in the future, could adversely affect our business and financial position.As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $1.0 billion of debt outstanding. Our level of debt and debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness, in part because of increases in interest rates on variable rate indebtedness under our revolving credit facility, could have significant consequences for our business. For example, our indebtedness could require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay the principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, acquisitions, dividends, capital expenditures, and other investments in our business, including investments in technology and research and development; make us vulnerable to economic downturns and increases in interest rates; limit us from obtaining additional debt; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industries in which we compete; and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors, some of whom have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resource than we do.  In addition, most of our debt arrangements require us to maintain certain debt and interest coverage ratios and limit our ability to incur debt, make investments or undertake certain other business activities. These requirements could limit our ability to obtain future financing and may prevent us from taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. Our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our debt arrangements may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the restrictions could result in an event of default under our debt arrangements which, in turn, could result in an event of default under the terms of our other indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our debt arrangements, after the expiration of any grace periods, our lenders could elect to declare 19all amounts outstanding under our debt arrangements, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to happen, we cannot ensure that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the payments due under those arrangements or our other indebtedness or that we could find alternative financing to replace that indebtedness.We self-insure health benefits and may be adversely impacted by unfavorable claims experience.We are primarily self-insured for our health benefits. If the number or severity of claims increases, or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than our original assessment, our operating results would be adversely affected. Our future claims expense might exceed historical levels, which could reduce our earnings. We expect to periodically assess our self-insurance strategy. We are required to periodically evaluate and adjust our claims reserves to reflect our experience. However, ultimate results may differ from our estimates, which could result in losses over our reserved amounts. In addition, because we do not carry “stop loss” insurance, a significant increase in the number of claims that we must cover under our self-insurance retainage could adversely affect our profitability.Increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.Our earnings may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of income or expense we record for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. U.S. GAAP requires that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions relating to financial markets and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can change the assumptions. The most significant year-end assumptions used to estimate pension or other postretirement benefit expense for the following year are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, expected future medical cost inflation, and expected compensation increases. In addition, we are required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant change to equity through a reduction or increase to other comprehensive income. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement benefit plans accounting policies, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies—Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. Although U.S. GAAP expense and pension or other postretirement contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect U.S. GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash we would contribute to the pension or other postretirement plans. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law, Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and discretionary contributions to improve the plans’ funded status. An obligation to make contributions to pension plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses.GENERAL RISKSOur future growth and continued success are dependent upon our key personnel.Our success in driving business performance and executing our growth strategy is dependent upon the efforts of our senior management personnel and our ability to attract and retain other highly qualified management and technical personnel. Because of the complex nature of many of our products and services, and our focus on technological and product innovations, we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilled workforce, including our engineering talent and our sales professionals. We strive to attract and hire talented employees, as well as support their growth, development, and engagement. However, we face competition for management and qualified technical personnel from other companies and organizations, which has intensified for a variety of reasons, including wage inflation, sustained labor shortages, and a shift toward remote work.  Therefore, we may not be able to retain our existing management and technical personnel or fill new management or technical positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover at our existing compensation levels. Although we have entered into change of control agreements with some members of senior management, we do not have employment contracts with our key executives. As some of our key executives approach retirement age, we have made a concerted effort to reduce the effect of the loss of our senior management personnel through management succession planning. However, we may be required to devote significant time and resources to identify and integrate key new personnel should key management losses occur earlier than anticipated. The loss of members of our senior management and qualified technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if the United States were to withdraw from or materially modify certain international trade agreements, or if tariffs or other restrictions on the foreign-sourced goods that we sell were to increase.A significant portion of our business activities are conducted in foreign countries, including Mexico and Canada. Our business benefits from free trade agreements such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement (USMCA) and relies on 20various U.S. corporate tax provisions related to international commerce as we build, market, and sell our products globally. Although there are no immediate effects on our operations with respect to USMCA, we cannot predict future developments in the political climate involving the United States, Mexico and Canada, and thus, these may have an adverse and material impact on our operations and financial growth.The United States and other countries have levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods (such as those implemented by the United States and China in recent years). Some of our products are included in these tariffs. All of this could lead to increased costs and diminished sales opportunities in the U.S. and abroad. Media and political reactions in the affected countries could potentially exacerbate the impact on our operations in those countries. The imposition of new or increased tariffs, duties, border adjustment taxes or other trade restrictions by the United States could also result in the adoption of new or increased tariffs or other trade restrictions by other countries. The tariffs may in the future increase our cost of materials and may cause us to increase prices to our customers which we believe may reduce demand for our products. Our price increases may not be sufficient to fully offset the impact of the tariffs and result in lowering our margin on products sold. If the U.S. government increases or implements additional tariffs, or if additional tariffs or trade restrictions are implemented by other countries, the resulting trade barriers could have a significant adverse impact on our suppliers, our customers and on our business. We are not able to predict future trade policy of the U.S. or of any foreign countries in which we operate or purchase goods, or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements, or their impact on our business.Global economic conditions may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.Although we currently generate significant operating cash flows, which combined with access to the credit markets provides us with significant discretionary funding capacity, global macroeconomic uncertainty, the ongoing trade disputes between the United States and China, the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, armed conflicts around the world, such as those in Ukraine and Israel, and any conflict or threatened conflict between China and Taiwan (including the imposition of related sanctions by the United States and other countries as well as measures taken in response to such sanctions), inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, labor shortages, global supply chain disruptions, and uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets could affect our ability to fund our operations. In addition, certain of our customers and suppliers could be affected directly by an economic downturn and could face credit issues or cash flow problems that could give rise to payment delays, increased credit risk, bankruptcies, and other financial hardships, which could impact customer demand for our products as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers and suppliers. Depending on their severity and duration, the effects and consequences of a global economic downturn could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.A percentage of our workforce is employed under collective bargaining agreements.Approximately 6% of our workforce is employed under collective bargaining agreements, which from time to time are subject to renewal and negotiation. We cannot ensure that we will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements, that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor, including healthcare, pensions, or other benefits, or that a breakdown in such negotiations will not result in the disruption of our operations, including by way of strikes or work stoppages. Although we have generally enjoyed good relations with both our unionized and non-unionized employees, we may experience an adverse impact on our operating results if we are subject to labor actions.Future terror attacks, war (including the Russia-Ukraine war and Israel-Hamas war), natural disasters, climate change-related events, pandemic diseases (such as COVID-19), or other events beyond our control could adversely impact our businesses.Despite our concerted effort to minimize risk to our production capabilities and corporate information systems and to reduce the effect of unforeseen interruptions through insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms, such as our business continuity planning and disaster recovery plans, we could be adversely impacted by terror attacks, war (including the Russia-Ukraine war and Israel-Hamas war), natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, ice storms, climate change-related events, pandemic diseases such as COVID-19, or other events such as strikes by the workforce of a significant customer or supplier. Several of our facilities, because of their locations, could be subject to catastrophic loss caused by the aforementioned natural disasters. Global climate change may aggravate natural disasters and increase severe weather events that affect our business operations. These risks could negatively impact demand for or supply of our products and could also cause disruption to our facilities or systems, which could also interrupt operational processes and adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products and provide services and support to our customers. The insurance we maintain may be insufficient to cover our losses, and any incidents may result in loss of, or increased costs of, such insurance. In addition, while our existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans, including those relating to our information technology systems are well designed, they may not be fully responsive to, or minimize losses associated with, catastrophic events. As a result, any business disruption could negatively affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. 21The COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted, and may in the future adversely impact, our business, operations, and financial results.The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the global economy and adversely impacted certain elements of our business, including our supply chain, transportation networks, and production levels. Although the World Health Organization and the U.S. federal government declared an end to COVID-19 as a global and national health emergency in May 2023, any future resurgence or development of new strains or variants of COVID-19, together with preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate such crises, could impact our business, operations and financial condition in a variety of ways, such as: (i) impact our customers such that the demand for our products and services could change; (ii) disrupt our supply chain and impact the ability of our suppliers to provide products or services as required; (iii) disrupt our ability to sell and provide our products and services and otherwise operate effectively; (iv) increase incremental costs resulting from the adoption of preventative measures and compliance with regulatory requirements; (v) create financial hardship on customers, including by creating restrictions on their ability to pay for our products and services; and (vi) result in closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers or suppliers"
7,CW,CURTISS-WRIGHT CORP,2023-02-22,"Risk Factors
.We have summarized the known, material risks to our business below. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely impacted if any of these risks materialize. Additional risk factors not currently known to us or that we believe are immaterial may also impair our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows, and require significant management time and attention. In addition to the risks and uncertainties set forth in section below entitled “Risks Related to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic,"" many of the risks and uncertainties set forth in the other risk factors are exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, corresponding government and business responses, and any further resulting decline in the global business and economic environment, and may be impacted by the extent and speed of the global economic recovery. The risk factors below should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as other required filings by us to the Securities Exchange Commission, such as our Form 10-Q’s, Form 8-K’s, proxy statements for our annual shareholder meetings, and subsequent amendments, if any.RISKS RELATED TO THE CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) PANDEMICThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and is expected to continue to pose risks to our business, the nature and extent of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable.10In March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated pandemic-related responses continue to cause significant and volatile disruptions in global economies, in capital markets, and across industries. While we continue to actively monitor the pandemic and take steps to mitigate the risks posed by its spread, there is no guarantee that our efforts will mitigate the adverse impacts of COVID-19 or will be effective.The pandemic has adversely affected, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, certain elements of our business, including our supply chain, transportation networks, and production levels. As of December 31, 2022, all of our manufacturing operations are operational. However, due to the numerous uncertainties that have arisen from the pandemic, including the likelihood of resurgences and the emergence and spread of variants, we are unable to predict if there will be additional government-imposed restrictions on our ability to operate in future periods. Additionally, our ability to continue to manufacture products is highly dependent on our ability to maintain the safety and health of our factory employees. The ability of our employees to work may be significantly impacted by the individuals contracting or being exposed to COVID-19 and its variants. While we are following the requirements of governmental authorities and taking preventative and protective measures to prioritize the safety of our employees, these measures are not always successful, and we may be required to temporarily close facilities or take other measures. Potential future directives curtailing in-person operations due to illness, quarantines, government actions, facility closures or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic could change at any time. This could have an adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of such manufacturing facilities, which could in turn adversely impact our business and operations.The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the global supply chain to a certain extent and availability of raw materials, particularly electronic parts. The disruption in the supply chain has resulted in increased freight costs, raw material costs, and labor costs from the ongoing inflationary environment. Because we strive to limit the volume of raw materials and component parts on hand, our business could be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain these raw materials and components from our suppliers in the quantities we require or on favorable terms. Although we believe in most cases that we could identify alternative suppliers, or alternative raw materials or component parts, the sometimes lengthy and expensive regulatory authority and OEM certification processes could prevent efficient replacement of a supplier, raw material, or component part.We continue to monitor the situation, assessing possible implications on our operations, supply chain, liquidity, cash flow and customer orders, and will continue taking actions to mitigate adverse consequences. Recognizing the unprecedented nature, scale and uncertainty associated with this global health crisis, the duration and extent of the ongoing impacts cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONSIntrusion on our systems could damage our business.We store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, and confidential employee information on our servers and databases. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused us to modify our business practices, including empowering many of our office-based associates to work productively from home on a hybrid basis. As a result, we are increasingly dependent upon our information systems to operate our business. Our ability to effectively manage our business depends on the security, reliability, and adequacy of our information systems. In addition, various privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations, both in the U.S. and globally, require us to manage and protect sensitive and confidential information, including personal data of our employees, from disclosure. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective in May 2018, extends the scope of the European Union data protection laws to all companies processing data of European Union residents, regardless of the company’s location. Additionally, we have incurred, and expect to continue to occur, additional costs to comply with increased cybersecurity protections for our customers, including the U.S. government. Despite our implementation of firewalls, switchgear, and other network security measures, our servers, databases, and other systems may be vulnerable to computer hackers, physical or electronic break-ins, sabotage, computer viruses, worms, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. The occurrence of some of these risks may be increased due to the increase in remote working by our employees due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to review and enhance our computer systems as well as provide training to our employees in an attempt to prevent unauthorized and unlawful intrusions. However, it is possible that we may not be able to prevent all intrusions. Such intrusions could result in our network security or computer systems being compromised and possibly result in the misappropriation or corruption of sensitive information or cause disruptions in our services. While we carry cyber insurance, we still may be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against, remediate, or alleviate problems caused by such intrusions. Any such intrusion could cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subject us to legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Potential product liability risks exist from the products that we sell.11We may be exposed to liabilities for personal injury, death, or property damage due to the failure of a product that we have sold. We typically agree to indemnify our customers against certain liabilities resulting from the products we sell, and any third-party indemnification we seek from our suppliers and our liability insurance may not fully cover our indemnification obligations to customers. We may also not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Any liability for which third-party indemnification is not available and not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.In addition, an accident caused by one of our products could damage our reputation for selling quality products. We believe that our customers consider safety and reliability as key criteria in selecting our products and believe that our reputation for quality assurance is a significant competitive strength. If an accident were to be caused by one of our products, or if we were to otherwise fail to maintain a satisfactory record of safety and reliability, our ability to retain and attract customers may be materially adversely affected.We are subject to liability under warranty obligations.The majority of our contracts contain provisions which expose us to potential liability for warranty claims made by customers or third parties with respect to products that have been designed, manufactured, or serviced by us or our suppliers. While we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain liability claims, that insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all claims that may arise, or we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Material product warranty obligations not covered by insurance or that exceed our established reserves could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our earnings and margins depend in part on subcontractor performance, as well as raw material and component availability and pricing.Our businesses depend on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials and components. At times subcontractors perform services that we provide to our customers. Our supply chain has been and may continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as other geo-political events, such as China’s relationship with the United States and Taiwan. Particularly, the market for electronic components is experiencing increased demand and a global shortage of semiconductors and other electronic items, creating substantial uncertainty regarding the timing of our suppliers’ production of key components for our products, which is adversely impacting the timing of sales in our Defense Electronics segment. We expect that these delays and shortages will continue in 2023, and that such shortages could result in delays in shipments to our customers during the period of such shortages.  We depend on subcontractors and suppliers to meet their contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements. Nonperformance or underperformance by subcontractors and suppliers could materially impact our ability to perform obligations to our customers, which could result in a customer terminating our contract for default, expose us to liability, and substantially impair our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. Generally, raw materials and purchased components are available from a number of different suppliers, though several suppliers are our sole source of certain components. If a sole-source supplier should cease or otherwise be unable to deliver such components, our operating results could be adversely impacted. In addition, supply chain constraints and improving economic conditions have resulted in sustained increases in the prices we pay for many of the components and raw materials used in our products. Furthermore, we are experiencing higher labor costs due to increased competition for personnel in many regions in which we operate as well as general inflationary conditions, including higher shipping costs, labor shortages, and rising energy prices. We expect inflationary pressures to persist in 2023. Our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor may be adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers is unable to provide the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner. While we have attempted to mitigate the effects of increased costs through price increases, there are no assurances that higher prices can effectively be passed through to our customers, or that we will be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw materials costs through price increases on a timely basis.Our business involves risks associated with complex manufacturing processes.Our manufacturing processes depend on certain sophisticated and high-value equipment. Unexpected failures of this equipment may result in production delays, revenue loss, and significant repair costs. In addition, equipment failures could result in injuries to our employees. Moreover, the competitive nature of our businesses requires us to continuously implement process changes intended to achieve product improvements and manufacturing efficiencies. These process changes may at times result in production delays, quality concerns, and increased costs. Any disruption of operations at our facilities due to equipment failures or process interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business.RISKS RELATED TO OUR STRATEGYImplementing our acquisition strategy involves risks, and our failure to successfully implement this strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business.12As part of our capital allocation strategy, we aim to grow our business by selectively pursuing acquisitions and technologies that supplement our organic growth. We are continuing to actively pursue additional acquisition opportunities, some of which may be material to our business and financial performance. Although we have been successful with this strategy in the past, we may not be able to grow our business in the future through acquisitions for several reasons, including:•Encountering difficulties identifying and executing acquisitions; •Increased competition for targets, which may increase acquisition costs;•Consolidation in our industry, reducing the number of acquisition targets;•Competition laws and regulations preventing us from making certain acquisitions; and•Acquisition financing not being available on acceptable terms, or at all.In addition, there are potential risks associated with growing our business through acquisitions, including the failure to successfully integrate and realize the expected benefits of an acquisition, which could be exacerbated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, with any past or future acquisition, there is the possibility that:•The business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture;•Technological and product synergies, economies of scale, or cost reductions may not occur as expected;•Management may be distracted from overseeing existing operations by the need to integrate acquired businesses;•We may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities;•We may experience unforeseen difficulties in integrating operations and systems;•We may fail to retain or assimilate employees of the acquired business;•We may experience problems in retaining customers or integrating customer bases; •We may experience increased capital requirements; •There could be insufficient internal controls over financial activities or financial reporting at an acquired company that could impact us on a consolidated basis; and•We may encounter difficulties in entering new markets in which we may have little or no experience.While we conduct financial and other due diligence in connection with our acquisitions and generally seek some form of protection, such as indemnification from the seller, insurance coverage, and sometimes placing a portion of the purchase price in escrow or a cash holdback to cover potential liabilities, such acquired companies may have weaknesses or liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition. Further, indemnities, insurance or escrow/holdback arrangements may not fully cover such matters.Failure to successfully implement our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop new technologies.Virtually all products produced and sold by us are highly engineered and require sophisticated manufacturing and system-integration techniques and capabilities. The commercial and government markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies. In addition, product and program needs of our government and commercial customers change and evolve regularly. Accordingly, to remain competitive in the future, we will need to continue to invest financial resources, including through internal research and development, acquisitions, or other teaming arrangements, to: (a) identify emerging technological trends in our current and target markets; (b) develop and manufacture competitive products, systems, and services; (c) enhance our offerings by adding technological innovations that differentiate our products, systems, and services from those of our competitors; and (d) develop, manufacture, and bring those products, systems, and service to market quickly at cost-effective prices. These expenditures could divert our attention and resources from other projects, and we cannot be sure that these expenditures will ultimately lead to the timely development of new offerings and technologies or identification of and expansion into new markets. Due to the design complexity of our products, we may, in the future, experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products. Any delays could result in increased costs of development or deflect resources from other projects. In addition, there can be no assurance that the market for our products will develop or continue to expand or that we will be successful in newly identified markets as we currently anticipate.We operate in highly competitive markets.Many of our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets, and are affected by varying degrees of competition, including competition for hiring and retaining skilled labor. We compete against companies that often have higher sales volumes and greater financial, technological, research and development, human, and marketing resources than we have. These companies may also price their products and services below our selling prices, which could exert downward pressure on our product pricing and margins. As a result, they may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns, including withstanding the current global pandemic. In addition, some of our largest customers could develop the capability to manufacture products or provide services similar to products that we manufacture or services that we provide. This would result 13in these customers supplying their own products or services and competing directly with us for sales of these products or services, all of which could significantly reduce our revenues. Furthermore, we are facing increased international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition. If consolidation of our competition continues to occur, we would expect the competitive pressures we face to increase. Our management believes that the principal points of competition in our markets are technology, price, product quality, product performance, sufficient supply of necessary components, technical expertise, timeliness of delivery, superior customer service and support, and continued certification under customer quality requirements and assurance programs. If we are unable to compete successfully with existing or new competitors in these areas, we may experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.We may be unable to protect the value of our intellectual property.Obtaining, maintaining, and enforcing our intellectual property rights and avoiding infringing on the intellectual property rights of others are important factors to the operation of our business. While we take precautionary steps to protect our technological advantages and intellectual property and rely in part on patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright laws, we cannot assure that the precautionary steps we have taken will completely protect our intellectual property rights. Because patent applications in the United States are maintained in secrecy until either the patent application is published or a patent is issued, we may not be aware of third-party patents, patent applications, and other intellectual property relevant to our products that may block our use of our intellectual property or may be used in third-party products that compete with our products and processes. When others infringe on our intellectual property rights, the value of our products is diminished, and we may incur substantial litigation costs to enforce our rights. Similarly, we may incur substantial litigation costs and the obligation to pay royalties if others claim we infringed on their intellectual property rights. When we develop intellectual property and technologies with funding from U.S. Government contracts, the government has the royalty-free right to use that property.In addition to our patent rights, we also rely on unpatented technology, trade secrets, and confidential information. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques or otherwise gain access to or disclose our technology. We may not be able to protect our rights in unpatented technology, trade secrets, and confidential information effectively. We generally require each of our employees and consultants to execute a confidentiality agreement at the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us. There is no guarantee that we will succeed in obtaining and retaining executed agreements from all employees or consultants. Moreover, these agreements may not provide effective protection of our information or, in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure, they may not provide adequate remedies.RISKS RELATED TO MARKET CONDITIONSA substantial portion of our revenues and earnings depends upon the continued willingness of the U.S. Government and other customers in the defense industry to buy our products and services.In 2022, approximately 47% of our total net sales were derived from or related to U.S. defense programs. U.S. defense spending has historically been cyclical, and defense budgets tend to rise when perceived threats to national security increase the level of concern over the country’s safety. At other times, spending by the military can decrease. In August 2011, Congress enacted the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA), which imposed spending caps and certain reductions in defense spending over a ten-year period through 2021. These spending caps and reductions, referred to as sequestration, went into effect in March 2013. Through a series of bipartisan agreements, Congress has been able to temporarily lift discretionary spending limits every year through 2019. On August 2, 2019, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 (BBA) was signed into law, which raised the BCA budget caps for both defense and non-defense discretionary spending in 2020 and 2021 and extended the mandatory BCA spending reductions through 2029. Absent additional legislative or other remedial action, the sequestration could require reduced U.S. federal government spending from fiscal 2022 through fiscal 2029. As a result of this uncertainty, a decrease in U.S. Government defense spending or changes in spending allocation could result in one or more of our programs being reduced, delayed, or terminated. In the event that one or more of our programs are reduced, delayed, or terminated for which we provide products and services, we may experience a reduction in our revenues and earnings and a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.The BBA also temporarily suspended the public debt limit through July 31, 2021. However, on December 16, 2021, President Biden signed legislation into law increasing the debt ceiling by $2.5 trillion, which is expected to allow the U.S. government to cover its debt obligations until at least July of 2023 unless Congress takes legislative action to further extend or increase it. Failure by Congress to further suspend or increase the debt ceiling could delay or result in the loss of contracts for the procurement of our products and services, and we may be asked or required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. government contracts, even if the U.S. government is unable to make timely payments.A downturn in the aircraft market could adversely affect our business.Our sales to large commercial aircraft manufacturers are cyclical in nature, and can be adversely affected by a number of factors, including current and future passenger traffic levels, increasing fuel and labor costs, environmental concerns (inclusive 14of climate change), intense price competition, the retirement of older aircraft, regulatory changes, outbreak of infectious disease such as the COVID-19 pandemic, terrorist attacks, geopolitical events, conflicts and wars (including the Russia-Ukraine conflict), general economic conditions (including cost inflation), worldwide airline profits, and backlog levels, all of which can be unpredictable and are outside our control. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic drastically reduced air traffic as travel restrictions and social distancing measures were implemented to help control the spread of the virus. The reduced air traffic applied financial pressures on airlines, who, in order to preserve cash and liquidity, dramatically reduced flight hours and delayed the purchases of new aircraft. While U.S. domestic air travel continues to recover, international travel utilizing wide-body aircraft will take longer to fully recover. Furthermore, as companies and employees become accustomed to working remotely, business travel and the associated flight hours may not reach pre-pandemic levels. As such, we believe the commercial market may shift away from wide-body aircraft. Any decrease in demand resulting from a downturn in the aerospace market could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our backlog is subject to reduction and cancellation, which could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.Backlog represents products or services that our customers have contractually committed to purchase from us. Total backlog includes both funded (unfilled orders for which funding is authorized, appropriated, and contractually obligated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated and/or contractually obligated by the customer). We are a subcontractor to prime contractors for the vast majority of our government business; as such, substantially all amounts in backlog are funded. Backlog excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering type contracts (e.g. Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity). Backlog is adjusted for changes in foreign exchange rates and is reduced for contract cancellations and terminations in the period in which they occur.  Backlog as of December 31, 2022 was $2.6 billion. Backlog is subject to fluctuations and is not necessarily indicative of future sales. The timing of backlog may be impacted by project delays. The U.S. Government may unilaterally modify or cancel its contracts. In addition, under certain of our commercial contracts, our customers may unilaterally modify or terminate their orders at any time for their convenience. Accordingly, certain portions of our backlog can be cancelled or reduced at the option of the U.S. Government and commercial customers. We believe that these risks are heightened due to the global economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our failure to replace cancelled or reduced backlog could negatively impact our results of operations.RISKS RELATED TO LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERSAs a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to numerous procurement rules and regulations.We must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business. A violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, the termination of our contracts, or debarment from bidding on contracts. These fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards, receiving or paying kickbacks, or filing false claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to audits, reviews, and investigations by government agencies. The failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation. It could also result in our progress payments being withheld. In some instances, these laws and regulations impose terms or rights that are more favorable to the government than those typically available to commercial parties in negotiated transactions. For example, the U.S. Government may terminate any of our government contracts and, in general, subcontracts, at its convenience as well as for default based on performance. Upon termination for convenience of a fixed-price type contract, we normally are entitled to receive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement for allowable costs for work-in-process, and an allowance for profit on work actually completed on the contract or adjustment for loss if completion of performance would have resulted in a loss. Upon termination for convenience of a cost reimbursement contract, we normally are entitled to reimbursement of allowable costs plus a portion of the fee. Such allowable costs would normally include our cost to terminate agreements with our suppliers and subcontractors. The amount of the fee recovered, if any, is related to the portion of the work accomplished prior to termination and is determined by negotiation.A termination arising out of our default could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. In addition, on those contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor, the U.S. Government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor, irrespective of the quality of our services as a subcontractor.Our U.S. Government contracts typically span one or more base years and multiple option years. The U.S. Government generally has the right to not exercise option periods and may not exercise an option period if the agency is not satisfied with our performance on the contract or does not receive funding to continue the program. U.S. Government procurement may adversely affect our cash flow or program profitability.Furthermore, we are subject to other risks in connection with government contracts, including without limitation:15•the frequent need to bid on programs prior to completing the necessary design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and/or cost overruns;•the difficulty in forecasting long-term costs and schedules and the potential obsolescence of products related to long-term, fixed price contracts;•contracts with varying fixed terms that may not be renewed or followed by follow-on contracts upon expiration;•cancellation of the follow-on production phase of contracts if program requirements are not met in the development phase; and•the fact that government contract wins can be contested by other contractors.Our operations are subject to numerous domestic and international laws, regulations, and restrictions. Noncompliance with these laws, regulations, and restrictions could expose us to fines, penalties, suspension, or debarment, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and overall financial condition.We have contracts and operations in many parts of the world subject to United States and foreign laws and regulations, including the False Claims Act, regulations relating to import-export control (including the International Traffic in Arms Regulation promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act), sanctions programs implemented by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of Treasury, technology transfer restrictions, repatriation of earnings, exchange controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act, and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act. Because the COVID-19 pandemic has so negatively impacted local economies, government intervention has increased, which in turn can create elevated risk and opportunity for corruption. Although we have implemented policies and procedures and provided training that we believe are sufficient to address these risks, we cannot guarantee that our operations will always comply with these laws and regulations. From time to time, we may file voluntary disclosure reports with the U.S. Department of State, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Commerce regarding certain violations of U.S. export control laws and regulations discovered by us in the course of our business activities, employee training, or internal reviews and audits. To date, our voluntary disclosures have not resulted in a fine, penalty, or export privilege denial or restriction that has had a material adverse impact on our financial condition or ability to export. Our failure, or failure by our sales representatives or consultants to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities and could, in the extreme case, result in suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.The airline industry is heavily regulated, and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements, our results of operations could suffer.Governmental agencies throughout the world, including the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the European Aviation Safety Agency, prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components, including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although compliance with FAA requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries. We include documentation with our products sold to aircraft manufacturing customers certifying that each part complies with applicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. In order to sell our products, we as well as the products that we manufacture must also be certified by our individual OEM customers. If any of the material authorizations or approvals qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended, then the sale of such product would be prohibited by law, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.From time to time, the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations, which are usually more stringent than existing regulations. If these proposed regulations are adopted and enacted, we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.We are subject to liability under environmental and health and safety laws and regulations.Our business and facilities are subject to numerous federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to the use, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials and other waste products. We may also be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future, particularly as greenhouse gas emissions and climate change regulations and initiatives increase. Environmental laws generally impose liability for investigation, remediation, and removal of hazardous materials and other waste products on property owners and those who dispose of materials at waste sites, whether or not the waste was disposed of legally at the time in question. We are currently addressing environmental remediation at certain current and former facilities, and we have been named as a potentially responsible party along with other organizations in a number of environmental clean-up sites and may be named in connection with future sites. We are required to contribute to the costs of the investigation and remediation and to establish reserves in our financial statements for future costs deemed probable and estimable. Although we have estimated and reserved for future environmental remediation costs, the final resolution of these liabilities may significantly vary from our estimates and could potentially have an adverse effect on our 16results of operations and financial position. We are also subject to worker health and safety requirements as well as various state and local public health laws, rules, regulations and orders related to COVID-19, including mask and social distancing requirements. While we are in compliance with government health and safety regulations related to COVID-19, the cost of complying, or failing to comply, with these regulations could have an adverse effect on our operating results.We may be subject to periodic litigation and regulatory proceedings, which may adversely affect our business and financial performance.From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions brought or threatened against us in the ordinary course of business. These actions and proceedings may involve claims for, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, workers’ compensation, employment discrimination, or breach of contract. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such actions or proceedings. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify, as plaintiffs may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts in these types of lawsuits, and the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. In addition, plaintiffs in many types of actions may seek punitive damages, civil penalties, consequential damages or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. These proceedings could result in substantial cost and may require us to devote substantial resources to defend ourselves and distract our management from the operation of our business. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses. The ultimate resolution of these matters through settlement, mediation, or court judgment could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by climate change regulations.Climate change regulations at the federal, state, or local level or in international jurisdictions could require us to limit emissions, change our manufacturing processes, obtain substitute materials which may cost more or be less available, increase our investment in control technology for greenhouse gas emissions, fund offset projects, or undertake other costly activities. These regulations could significantly increase our costs and restrict our manufacturing operations by virtue of requirements for new equipment. New permits may be required for our current operations, or expansions thereof. Failure to timely receive permits could result in fines, suspension of production, or cessation of operations at one or more facilities. In addition, restrictions on carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas emissions could result in significant costs such as higher energy costs and the passing down of carbon taxes, emission cap and trade programs, and renewable portfolio standards by utility companies. The cost of complying, or of failing to comply, with these and other climate change and emissions regulations could have an adverse effect on our operating results.Increasing focus on environmental, social, and governance responsibility may impose additional costs on us and expose us to new risks.Regulators, stockholders, and other interested constituencies have focused increasingly on corporate responsibility, specifically related to the environmental, social, and governance (ESG), practices of companies, including climate change. Some investors have used, and may continue to use, ESG criteria to guide their investment strategies, and may not invest in us, or divest their holdings of us, if they believe our policies relating to ESG matters are inadequate. Our customers may also require us to implement environmental, social, or governance responsibility procedures or standards before they continue to do business with us. Additionally, we may face reputational challenges if our environmental, social, or governance responsibility procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by certain constituencies. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.RISKS RELATED TO FINANCIAL MATTERSPolitical and economic changes in foreign countries and markets, including foreign currency fluctuations, may have a material effect on our operating results.During 2022, approximately 27% of our total net sales were to customers outside of the United States. Additionally, we also have operating facilities located in foreign countries. Doing business in foreign countries is subject to numerous risks, including without limitation: (a) political and economic instability and potential for social unrest; (b) the uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases; (c) restrictions on the repatriation of funds;  (d) restrictive trade policies; (e) tariff regulations; (f) difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses; (g) government financed competition; (h) changes in the local labor-relations climate; (i) economic conditions in local markets, including changes in inflation; (j) health concerns (including the COVID-19 pandemic); (k) complying with foreign regulatory and tax requirements that are subject to change; and (l) limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies.  For example, in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the United States, along with the European Union, has imposed restrictive sanctions on Russia, Russian entities, and Russian citizens. We are subject to these governmental sanctions and export controls, which may subject us to liability if we are not in 17full compliance with applicable laws. Further, implementation of new tariff schemes by various governments, such as those implemented by the United States and China in recent years, could potentially increase the costs of our materials, increase our cost of production, and ultimately increase the landed cost of our products sold from one country into another country. While these factors or the impact of these factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations. There has been, and may continue to be, significant volatility in global stock markets and foreign currency exchange rates that result in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business. To the extent that foreign sales are transacted in foreign currencies and we do not enter into currency hedge transactions, we are exposed to risk of losses due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly for the British Pound, Euro, and Canadian dollar.  Significant fluctuations in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our cash flows and financial condition. Our business operates in many locations under government jurisdictions that impose income taxes. Changes in domestic or foreign income tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or lower income tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain revenues or the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability. In both 2021 and 2022, the Biden administration announced, and in certain cases has enacted, several tax proposals to fund new government investments in infrastructure, healthcare, and education, among others. Certain of these proposals involve an increase in the domestic corporate tax rate, which if implemented could have a material impact on our future results of operations and cash flows. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) was signed into law, with tax provisions primarily focused on implementing a 15% minimum tax on global adjusted financial statement income and a 1% excise tax on share repurchases. Certain provisions of the IRA will become effective beginning in fiscal 2023.  We have evaluated the impact of the IRA on our business, and deem it to be immaterial. In addition, on March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act, among other things, included certain changes in tax law intended to stimulate the U.S. economy due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including temporary beneficial changes to the treatment of net operating losses, interest deductibility limitations, and payroll tax matters. The CARES Act is subject to interpretation and implementation guidance by both federal and state tax authorities, as well as amendments and technical corrections. Any or all of these could impact our business unfavorably. Additionally, tax rates in various jurisdictions in which we operate or sell into may increase as a means of funding the significant cost of governmental stimulus measures enacted to assist and protect individuals and businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. It cannot be predicted whether, when, in what form, or with what effective dates, new tax laws or changes in tax rates may be enacted, or regulations and rulings may be enacted, promulgated or issued under existing or new tax laws, which could result in an increase in our tax liability or require changes in the manner in which we operate in order to minimize or mitigate any adverse effects of changes in tax law or in the interpretation thereof.Furthermore, the amount of income taxes paid by us is subject to examination by U.S. federal, state, and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from such examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of any such examinations. If the ultimate determination of our taxes owed were for an amount in excess of amounts reserved, our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.We use estimates when accounting for long-term contracts. Changes in estimates could affect our profitability and overall financial position.Long-term contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. For example, assumptions must be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract, as costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials. Similarly, assumptions must be made regarding the future impact of efficiency initiatives and cost reduction efforts. Incentives, awards, price escalations, liquidated damages, or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates using either the expected value method or most likely amount method. It is possible that materially different amounts could be obtained, because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, if different assumptions were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances, or estimates may have a material adverse effect upon future period financial reporting and performance. See “Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.Our future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairment charges.18As of December 31, 2022, we had goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of approximately $2.2 billion, which represented approximately 49% of our total assets. Our goodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and is also tested whenever events and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. Intangible assets (other than goodwill) are generally amortized over the useful life of such assets. In addition, from time to time, we may acquire or make an investment in a business that will require us to record goodwill based on the purchase price and the value of the acquired assets. We may subsequently experience unforeseen issues with such business that adversely affect the anticipated returns of the business or value of the intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets for such business. For example, if the financial performance of such business was to decline significantly, we could incur a material non-cash charge to our income statement for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets. Future determinations of significant write-offs of goodwill or intangible assets as a result of an impairment test or any accelerated amortization of other intangible assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.Our current debt, and debt we may incur in the future, could adversely affect our business and financial position.As of December 31, 2022, we had $1.3 billion of debt outstanding. Our level of debt could have significant consequences for our business. For example, our indebtedness could require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay the principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, acquisitions, dividends, capital expenditures, and other investments in our business, including investments in technology and research and development; make us vulnerable to economic downturns and increases in interest rates; limit us from obtaining additional debt; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industries in which we compete; and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors, some of whom have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resource than we do.We self-insure health benefits and may be adversely impacted by unfavorable claims experience.We are primarily self-insured for our health benefits. If the number or severity of claims increases, or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than our original assessment, our operating results would be adversely affected. Our future claims expense might exceed historical levels, which could reduce our earnings. We expect to periodically assess our self-insurance strategy. We are required to periodically evaluate and adjust our claims reserves to reflect our experience. However, ultimate results may differ from our estimates, which could result in losses over our reserved amounts. In addition, because we do not carry “stop loss” insurance, a significant increase in the number of claims that we must cover under our self-insurance retainage could adversely affect our profitability.Increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.Our earnings may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of income or expense we record for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. U.S. GAAP requires that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions relating to financial markets and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can change the assumptions. The most significant year-end assumptions used to estimate pension or other postretirement benefit expense for the following year are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, expected future medical cost inflation, and expected compensation increases. In addition, we are required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant change to equity through a reduction or increase to other comprehensive income. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement benefit plans accounting policies, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies—Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. Although U.S. GAAP expense and pension or other postretirement contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect U.S. GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash we would contribute to the pension or other postretirement plans. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law, Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and discretionary contributions to improve the plans’ funded status. An obligation to make contributions to pension plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses.GENERAL RISKSOur future growth and continued success are dependent upon our key personnel.Our success is dependent upon the efforts of our senior management personnel and our ability to attract and retain other highly qualified management and technical personnel. We face competition for management and qualified technical personnel from other companies and organizations. Additionally, it is particularly difficult to hire new employees during the COVID-19 pandemic as conducting interviews remotely makes it more difficult to ensure that we are recruiting and hiring high-quality employees. Further, the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic makes it less likely that potential candidates will be willing to leave a stable job to explore a new opportunity. Therefore, we may not be able to retain our existing management and technical personnel or fill new management or technical positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover at our existing compensation levels. Although we have entered into change of control agreements with some members of senior management, 19we do not have employment contracts with our key executives. As some of our key executives approach retirement age, we have made a concerted effort to reduce the effect of the loss of our senior management personnel through management succession planning. However, we may be required to devote significant time and resources to identify and integrate key new personnel should key management losses occur earlier than anticipated. The loss of members of our senior management and qualified technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.On September 9, 2021, President Biden directed the Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) to issue an Emergency Temporary Standard (“ETS”) requiring that all employers with at least 100 employees ensure that their employees are fully vaccinated for COVID-19 or obtain a negative COVID-19 test at least once a week. On November 4, 2021, the OSHA issued an emergency regulation to carry out this mandate, which was expected to take effect on January 4, 2022. However, OSHA withdrew the ETS on January 26, 2022 as an enforceable emergency temporary standard following the U.S. Supreme Court issuing a nationwide stay prohibiting OSHA from enforcing or implementing the ETS. OSHA explicitly did not withdraw the ETS as a proposed rule, such that it is possible that a permanent rule regarding COVID-19 vaccination and testing requirements will ultimately be issued by OSHA following a formal rulemaking process. President Biden also issued an Executive Order requiring certain COVID-19 precautions for government contractors and their subcontractors, including mandatory employee vaccination, with exemptions only for medical or religious reasons. These requirements for federal contractors have been the subject of multiple lawsuits and enforcement has been enjoined nationwide, with appeals from those decisions pending in multiple federal appellate courts. It is not currently possible to predict the impact on our business of a permanent OSHA rule, or the requirements for government contractors and their subcontractors, to the extent that such OSHA rule and requirements for federal contractors are ultimately implemented and enforced. But many states and localities are free to impose vaccine requirements. Despite the previous legal and timing uncertainties relating to these regulations, we implemented requirements regarding mandatory vaccines for U.S. based covered employees, subject to approved exemptions. It is possible that additional vaccine and testing mandates may be announced in other jurisdictions in which we operate our business. While it is not currently possible to predict with any certainty the exact impact any new state, local or foreign vaccine regulations would have on our operations, our suppliers and our customers, the implementation of such state, local or foreign government mandated vaccination or testing mandates may impact our ability to retain current employees, attract new employees, and result in labor disruptions and may have an adverse effect on future profitability. Further, implementation could also have similar consequences for our subcontractors, which may impact their ability to deliver the goods and services we need from them. In addition, any requirement to impose obligations on our suppliers under the Executive Order covering government contractors and their subcontractors could impact the price and continuity of supply of raw materials, whereby our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if the United States were to withdraw from or materially modify certain international trade agreements, or if tariffs or other restrictions on the foreign-sourced goods that we sell were to increase.A significant portion of our business activities are conducted in foreign countries, including Mexico and Canada. Our business benefits from free trade agreements such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement (USMCA) and relies on various U.S. corporate tax provisions related to international commerce as we build, market, and sell our products globally. Although there are no immediate effects on our operations with respect to USMCA, we cannot predict future developments in the political climate involving the United States, Mexico and Canada, and thus, these may have an adverse and material impact on our operations and financial growth.The United States and other countries have levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods (such as those implemented by the United States and China in recent years). Some of our products are included in these tariffs. All of this could lead to increased costs and diminished sales opportunities in the U.S. and abroad. Media and political reactions in the affected countries could potentially exacerbate the impact on our operations in those countries. The imposition of new or increased tariffs, duties, border adjustment taxes or other trade restrictions by the United States could also result in the adoption of new or increased tariffs or other trade restrictions by other countries. The tariffs may in the future increase our cost of materials and may cause us to increase prices to our customers which we believe may reduce demand for our products. Our price increases may not be sufficient to fully offset the impact of the tariffs and result in lowering our margin on products sold. If the U.S. government increases or implements additional tariffs, or if additional tariffs or trade restrictions are implemented by other countries, the resulting trade barriers could have a significant adverse impact on our suppliers, our customers and on our business. We are not able to predict future trade policy of the U.S. or of any foreign countries in which we operate or purchase goods, or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements, or their impact on our business.Global economic conditions may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.Although we currently generate significant operating cash flows, which combined with access to the credit markets provides us with significant discretionary funding capacity, global macroeconomic uncertainty, including the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing trade disputes between the United States and China, the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, the Russia-Ukraine conflict (including related sanctions as well as measures taken in response to 20such sanction), inflationary pressures, global supply chain disruptions, and uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets could affect our ability to fund our operations. In addition, certain of our customers and suppliers could be affected directly by an economic downturn and could face credit issues or cash flow problems that could give rise to payment delays, increased credit risk, bankruptcies, and other financial hardships, which could impact customer demand for our products as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers and suppliers. Depending on their severity and duration, the effects and consequences of a global economic downturn could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.A percentage of our workforce is employed under collective bargaining agreements.Approximately 7% of our workforce is employed under collective bargaining agreements, which from time to time are subject to renewal and negotiation. We cannot ensure that we will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements, that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor, including healthcare, pensions, or other benefits, or that a breakdown in such negotiations will not result in the disruption of our operations, including by way of strikes or work stoppages. Although we have generally enjoyed good relations with both our unionized and non-unionized employees, we may experience an adverse impact on our operating results if we are subject to labor actions.Future terror attacks, war (including the Russia-Ukraine conflict), natural disasters, climate change-related events, pandemic diseases (including the COVID-19 pandemic), or other events beyond our control could adversely impact our businesses.Despite our concerted effort to minimize risk to our production capabilities and corporate information systems and to reduce the effect of unforeseen interruptions through insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms, such as our business continuity planning and disaster recovery plans, we could be adversely impacted by terror attacks, war (including the Russia-Ukraine conflict), natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, ice storms, climate change-related events, pandemic diseases such as COVID-19, or other events such as strikes by the workforce of a significant customer or supplier. Several of our facilities, because of their locations, could be subject to catastrophic loss caused by the aforementioned natural disasters. Global climate change may aggravate natural disasters and increase severe weather events that affect our business operations. These risks could negatively impact demand for or supply of our products and could also cause disruption to our facilities or systems, which could also interrupt operational processes and adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products and provide services and support to our customers. The insurance we maintain may be insufficient to cover our losses, and any incidents may result in loss of, or increased costs of, such insurance. In addition, while our existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans (including those relating to our information technology systems) are well designed, they may not be fully responsive to, or minimize losses associated with, catastrophic events. As a result, any business disruption could negatively affect our business, operating results, or financial condition"
13,CW,CURTISS-WRIGHT CORP,2022-02-24,"Risk Factors
.We have summarized the known, material risks to our business below. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely impacted if any of these risks materialize. Additional risk factors not currently known to us or that we believe are immaterial may also impair our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows, and require significant management time and attention. In addition to the risks and uncertainties set forth in section below entitled “Risks Related to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic,"" many of the risks and uncertainties set forth in the other risk factors are exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, corresponding government and business responses, and any further resulting decline in the global business and economic environment, and may be impacted by the extent and speed of the global economic recovery. The risk factors below should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as other required filings by us to the Securities Exchange Commission, such as our Form 10-Q’s, Form 8-K’s, proxy statements for our annual shareholder meetings, and subsequent amendments, if any.RISKS RELATED TO THE CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) PANDEMICThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and is expected to continue to pose risks to our business, the nature and extent of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable.In March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated pandemic-related responses continue to cause significant and volatile disruptions in global economies, in capital markets, and across industries. While we continue to actively monitor the pandemic and take steps to mitigate the risks posed by its spread, there is no guarantee that our efforts will mitigate the adverse impacts of COVID-19 or will be effective.The pandemic has adversely affected, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, certain elements of our business, including our supply chain and production levels. As of December 31, 2021, all of our manufacturing operations are operational. However, we are unable to predict if there will be additional government-imposed restrictions on our ability to operate in future periods. Additionally, our ability to continue to manufacture products is highly dependent on our ability to maintain the safety and health of our factory employees. The ability of our employees to work may be significantly impacted by the individuals contracting or being exposed to COVID-19 and its variants. While we are following the requirements of governmental authorities and taking preventative and protective measures to prioritize the safety of our employees, these measures are not always successful, and we may be required to temporarily close facilities or take other measures. Potential future directives curtailing in-person operations due to illness, quarantines, government actions, facility closures or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic could change at any time. This could have an adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of such manufacturing facilities, which could in turn adversely impact our business and operations.The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the global supply chain to a certain extent and availability of raw materials, particularly electronic parts. Because we strive to limit the volume of raw materials and component parts on hand, our business could be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain these raw materials and components from our suppliers in the quantities we require or on favorable terms. We continue to monitor the situation, assessing possible implications on our operations, supply chain, liquidity, cash flow and customer orders, and will continue taking actions in an effort to mitigate adverse consequences. Recognizing the unprecedented 9nature, scale and uncertainty associated with this global health crisis, the duration and extent of the ongoing impacts cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONSIntrusion on our systems could damage our business.We store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, and confidential employee information on our servers and databases. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused us to modify our business practices, including empowering many of our office-based associates to work productively from home on a hybrid basis when appropriate to do so. As a result, we are increasingly dependent upon our information systems to operate our business. Our ability to effectively manage our business depends on the security, reliability, and adequacy of our information systems. In addition, various privacy and securities laws require us to manage and protect sensitive and confidential information, including personal data of our employees, from disclosure. For example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective in May 2018, extends the scope of the European Union data protection laws to all companies processing data of European Union residents, regardless of the company's location. Despite our implementation of firewalls, switchgear, and other network security measures, our servers, databases, and other systems may be vulnerable to computer hackers, physical or electronic break-ins, sabotage, computer viruses, worms, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. We continue to review and enhance our computer systems as well as provide training to our employees in an attempt to prevent unauthorized and unlawful intrusions, but in the future, it is possible that we may not be able to prevent all intrusions. Such intrusions could result in our network security or computer systems being compromised and possibly result in the misappropriation or corruption of sensitive information or cause disruptions in our services. While we carry cyber insurance, we still may be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against, remediate, or alleviate problems caused by such intrusions. Any such intrusion could cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subject us to legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Potential product liability risks exist from the products that we sell.We may be exposed to liabilities for personal injury, death, or property damage due to the failure of a product that we have sold. We typically agree to indemnify our customers against certain liabilities resulting from the products we sell, and any third-party indemnification we seek from our suppliers and our liability insurance may not fully cover our indemnification obligations to customers. We may also not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Any liability for which third-party indemnification is not available that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.In addition, an accident caused by one of our products could damage our reputation for selling quality products. We believe that our customers consider safety and reliability as key criteria in selecting our products and believe that our reputation for quality assurance is a significant competitive strength. If an accident were to be caused by one of our products, or if we were to otherwise fail to maintain a satisfactory record of safety and reliability, our ability to retain and attract customers may be materially adversely affected.We are subject to liability under warranty obligations.The majority of our contracts contain provisions which expose us to potential liability for warranty claims made by customers or third parties with respect to products that have been designed, manufactured, or serviced by us or our suppliers. Material product warranty obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.If we fail to satisfy our contractual obligations, our contracts may be terminated and we may incur significant costs or liabilities, including liquidated damages and penalties.In general, our contracts may be terminated for our failure to satisfy our contractual obligations. In addition, some of our contracts contain substantial liquidated damages provisions and financial penalties related to our failure to satisfy our contractual obligations. Our inability to sufficiently satisfy contractual obligations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.Our earnings and margins depend in part on subcontractor performance, as well as raw material and component availability and pricing.Our businesses depend on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials and components. At times subcontractors perform services that we provide to our customers. Our supply chain has been and may continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 10pandemic. We depend on these subcontractors and suppliers to meet their contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements. Nonperformance or underperformance by subcontractors and suppliers could materially impact our ability to perform obligations to our customers, which could result in a customer terminating our contract for default, expose us to liability, and substantially impair our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. Generally, raw materials and purchased components are available from a number of different suppliers, though several suppliers are our sole source of certain components. If a sole-source supplier should cease or otherwise be unable to deliver such components, our operating results could be adversely impacted. In addition, our supply networks can sometimes experience price fluctuations. Our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor may be adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers are unable to provide the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner. While we have attempted to mitigate the effects of increased costs through price increases, there are no assurances that higher prices can effectively be passed through to our customers or that we will be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw materials costs through price increases on a timely basis.Our business involves risks associated with complex manufacturing processes.Our manufacturing processes depend on certain sophisticated and high-value equipment. Unexpected failures of this equipment may result in production delays, revenue loss, and significant repair costs. In addition, equipment failures could result in injuries to our employees. Moreover, the competitive nature of our businesses requires us to continuously implement process changes intended to achieve product improvements and manufacturing efficiencies. These process changes may at times result in production delays, quality concerns, and increased costs. Any disruption of operations at our facilities due to equipment failures or process interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business.RISKS RELATED TO OUR STRATEGYImplementing our acquisition strategy involves risks, and our failure to successfully implement this strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business.As part of our capital allocation strategy, we aim to grow our business by selectively pursuing acquisitions and technologies that supplement our organic growth. We are continuing to actively pursue additional acquisition opportunities, some of which may be material to our business and financial performance. Although we have been successful with this strategy in the past, we may not be able to grow our business in the future through acquisitions for several reasons, including:•Encountering difficulties identifying and executing acquisitions; •Increased competition for targets, which may increase acquisition costs;•Consolidation in our industry, reducing the number of acquisition targets;•Competition laws and regulations preventing us from making certain acquisitions; and•Acquisition financing not being available on acceptable terms, or at all.In addition, there are potential risks associated with growing our business through acquisitions, including the failure to successfully integrate and realize the expected benefits of an acquisition, which could be exacerbated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, with any past or future acquisition, there is the possibility that:•The business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture;•Technological and product synergies, economies of scale, or cost reductions may not occur as expected;•Management may be distracted from overseeing existing operations by the need to integrate acquired businesses;•We may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities;•We may experience unforeseen difficulties in integrating operations and systems;•We may fail to retain or assimilate employees of the acquired business;•We may experience problems in retaining customers or integrating customer bases; and•We may encounter difficulties in entering new markets in which we may have little or no experience.11Failure to successfully implement our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop new technologies.Virtually all products produced and sold by us are highly engineered and require sophisticated manufacturing and system-integration techniques and capabilities. The commercial and government markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies. The product and program needs of our government and commercial customers change and evolve regularly. Accordingly, our future performance depends in part on our ability to: identify emerging technological trends in our current and target markets; develop and manufacture competitive products, systems, and services; enhance our offerings by adding technological innovations that differentiate our products, systems, and services from those of our competitors; and develop, manufacture, and bring those products, systems, and service to market quickly at cost-effective prices. We operate in highly competitive markets.Many of our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets and are affected by varying degrees of competition. We compete against companies that often have higher sales volumes and greater financial, technological, research and development, human, and marketing resources than we have. As a result, they may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns, including withstanding the current global pandemic. In addition, some of our largest customers could develop the capability to manufacture products or provide services similar to products that we manufacture or services that we provide. This would result in these customers supplying their own products or services and competing directly with us for sales of these products or services, all of which could significantly reduce our revenues. Furthermore, we are facing increased international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition. Our management believes that the principal points of competition in our markets are technology, product quality, product performance, price, technical expertise, timeliness of delivery, superior customer service and support, and continued certification under customer quality requirements and assurance programs. If we are unable to compete successfully with existing or new competitors in these areas, we may experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.We may be unable to protect the value of our intellectual property.Obtaining, maintaining, and enforcing our intellectual property rights and avoiding infringing on the intellectual property rights of others are important factors to the operation of our business. While we take precautionary steps to protect our technological advantages and intellectual property and rely in part on patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright laws, we cannot assure that the precautionary steps we have taken will completely protect our intellectual property rights. Because patent applications in the United States are maintained in secrecy until either the patent application is published or a patent is issued, we may not be aware of third-party patents, patent applications, and other intellectual property relevant to our products that may block our use of our intellectual property or may be used in third-party products that compete with our products and processes. When others infringe on our intellectual property rights, the value of our products is diminished, and we may incur substantial litigation costs to enforce our rights. Similarly, we may incur substantial litigation costs and the obligation to pay royalties if others claim we infringed on their intellectual property rights. When we develop intellectual property and technologies with funding from U.S. Government contracts, the government has the royalty-free right to use that property.In addition to our patent rights, we also rely on unpatented technology, trade secrets, and confidential information. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques or otherwise gain access to or disclose our technology. We may not be able to protect our rights in unpatented technology, trade secrets, and confidential information effectively. We generally require each of our employees and consultants to execute a confidentiality agreement at the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us. There is no guarantee that we will succeed in obtaining and retaining executed agreements from all employees or consultants. Moreover, these agreements may not provide effective protection of our information or, in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure, they may not provide adequate remedies.RISKS RELATED TO MARKET CONDITIONSA substantial portion of our revenues and earnings depends upon the continued willingness of the U.S. Government and other customers in the defense industry to buy our products and services.In 2021, approximately 50% of our total net sales were derived from or related to U.S. defense programs. U.S. defense spending has historically been cyclical, and defense budgets tend to rise when perceived threats to national security increase the level of concern over the country’s safety. At other times, spending by the military can decrease. In August 2011, Congress enacted the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA), which imposed spending caps and certain reductions in defense spending over a ten-year 12period through 2021. These spending caps and reductions, referred to as sequestration, went into effect in March 2013. Through a series of bipartisan agreements, Congress has been able to temporarily lift discretionary spending limits every year through 2019. On August 2, 2019, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 (BBA) was signed into law, which raised the BCA budget caps for both defense and non-defense discretionary spending in 2020 and 2021 and extended the mandatory BCA spending reductions through 2029. Absent additional legislative or other remedial action, the sequestration could require reduced U.S. federal government spending from fiscal 2022 through fiscal 2029. As a result of this uncertainty, a decrease in U.S. Government defense spending or changes in spending allocation could result in one or more of our programs being reduced, delayed, or terminated. In the event that one or more of our programs are reduced, delayed, or terminated for which we provide products and services, we may experience a reduction in our revenues and earnings and a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The BBA also temporarily suspended the public debt limit through July 31, 2021, which Congress temporarily extended through December 3, 2021. However, on December 16, 2021, President Biden signed legislation into law increasing the debt ceiling by $2.5 trillion, which is expected to allow the U.S. government to cover its debt obligations into fiscal year 2023. Failure by Congress to further suspend or increase the debt ceiling could delay or result in the loss of contracts for the procurement of our products and services, and we may be asked or required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. government contracts, even if the U.S. government is unable to make timely payments.A downturn in the aircraft market could adversely affect our business.Our sales to large commercial aircraft manufacturers are cyclical in nature and can be adversely affected by a number of factors, including current and future passenger traffic levels, increasing fuel and labor costs, environmental concerns, inclusive of climate change, intense price competition, the retirement of older aircraft, regulatory changes, outbreak of infectious disease such as the COVID-19 pandemic, terrorist attacks, general economic conditions, worldwide airline profits, and backlog levels, all of which can be unpredictable and are outside our control. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic drastically reduced air traffic as travel restrictions and social distancing measures were implemented to help control the spread of the virus. The reduced air traffic applied financial pressures on airlines, who, in order to preserve cash and liquidity, dramatically reduced flight hours and delayed the purchases of new aircraft. Although U.S. domestic air travel has increased during 2021, international travel has not yet begun to recover at the same pace. Given the uncertain length of this pandemic and associated restrictions to travel long distances, the commercial market may shift away from wide-body aircraft. Furthermore, as companies and employees become accustomed to working remotely, business travel and the associated flight hours may not reach the pre-pandemic levels. Any decrease in demand resulting from a downturn in the aerospace market could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our backlog is subject to reduction and cancellation, which could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.Backlog represents products or services that our customers have contractually committed to purchase from us. Total backlog includes both funded (unfilled orders for which funding is authorized, appropriated, and contractually obligated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated and/or contractually obligated by the customer). We are a subcontractor to prime contractors for the vast majority of our government business; as such, substantially all amounts in backlog are funded. Backlog excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering type contracts (e.g. Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity). Backlog is adjusted for changes in foreign exchange rates and is reduced for contract cancellations and terminations in the period in which they occur. Backlog as of December 31, 2021 was $2.2 billion. Backlog is subject to fluctuations and is not necessarily indicative of future sales. The timing of backlog may be impacted by project delays. The U.S. Government may unilaterally modify or cancel its contracts. In addition, under certain of our commercial contracts, our customers may unilaterally modify or terminate their orders at any time for their convenience. Accordingly, certain portions of our backlog can be cancelled or reduced at the option of the U.S. Government and commercial customers. We believe that these risks are heightened due to the global economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our failure to replace cancelled or reduced backlog could negatively impact our results of operations.RISKS RELATED TO LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERSAs a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to numerous procurement rules and regulations.We must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business. A violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, the termination of our contracts, or debarment from bidding on contracts. These fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards, receiving or paying kickbacks, or filing false claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies. The failure to comply with the terms of our government 13contracts could harm our business reputation. It could also result in our progress payments being withheld. In some instances, these laws and regulations impose terms or rights that are more favorable to the government than those typically available to commercial parties in negotiated transactions. For example, the U.S. Government may terminate any of our government contracts and, in general, subcontracts, at its convenience as well as for default based on performance. Upon termination for convenience of a fixed-price type contract, we normally are entitled to receive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement for allowable costs for work-in-process, and an allowance for profit on work actually completed on the contract or adjustment for loss if completion of performance would have resulted in a loss. Upon termination for convenience of a cost reimbursement contract, we normally are entitled to reimbursement of allowable costs plus a portion of the fee. Such allowable costs would normally include our cost to terminate agreements with our suppliers and subcontractors. The amount of the fee recovered, if any, is related to the portion of the work accomplished prior to termination and is determined by negotiation.A termination arising out of our default could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. In addition, on those contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor, the U.S. Government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor, irrespective of the quality of our services as a subcontractor.Our U.S. Government contracts typically span one or more base years and multiple option years. The U.S. Government generally has the right to not exercise option periods and may not exercise an option period if the agency is not satisfied with our performance on the contract or does not receive funding to continue the program. U.S. Government procurement may adversely affect our cash flow or program profitability.Furthermore, we are subject to other risks in connection with government contracts, including without limitation:•the frequent need to bid on programs prior to completing the necessary design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and/or cost overruns;•the difficulty in forecasting long-term costs and schedules and the potential obsolescence of products related to long-term, fixed price contracts;•contracts with varying fixed terms that may not be renewed or followed by follow-on contracts upon expiration;•cancellation of the follow-on production phase of contracts if program requirements are not met in the development phase; and•the fact that government contract wins can be contested by other contractors.Our operations are subject to numerous domestic and international laws, regulations, and restrictions. Noncompliance with these laws, regulations, and restrictions could expose us to fines, penalties, suspension, or debarment, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and overall financial condition.We have contracts and operations in many parts of the world subject to United States and foreign laws and regulations, including the False Claims Act, regulations relating to import-export control (including the International Traffic in Arms Regulation promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act), sanctions programs implemented by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of Treasury, technology transfer restrictions, repatriation of earnings, exchange controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act, and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act. Because the COVID-19 pandemic has so negatively impacted local economies, government intervention has increased, which in turn can create elevated risk and opportunity for corruption. Although we have implemented policies and procedures and provided training that we believe are sufficient to address these risks, we cannot guarantee that our operations will always comply with these laws and regulations. From time to time, we may file voluntary disclosure reports with the U.S. Department of State, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Commerce regarding certain violations of U.S. export control laws and regulations discovered by us in the course of our business activities, employee training, or internal reviews and audits. To date, our voluntary disclosures have not resulted in a fine, penalty, or export privilege denial or restriction that has had a material adverse impact on our financial condition or ability to export. Our failure, or failure by our sales representatives or consultants to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities and could, in the extreme case, result in suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.The airline industry is heavily regulated, and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements, our results of operations could suffer.14Governmental agencies throughout the world, including the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the European Aviation Safety Agency, prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components, including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although compliance with FAA requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries. We include documentation with our products sold to aircraft manufacturing customers certifying that each part complies with applicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. In order to sell our products, the Corporation as well as the products that we manufacture must also be certified by our individual OEM customers. If any of the material authorizations or approvals qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended, then the sale of such product would be prohibited by law, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.From time to time, the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations, which are usually more stringent than existing regulations. If these proposed regulations are adopted and enacted, we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.We are subject to liability under environmental and health and safety laws and regulations.Our business and facilities are subject to numerous federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to the use, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials and other waste products. Environmental laws generally impose liability for investigation, remediation, and removal of hazardous materials and other waste products on property owners and those who dispose of materials at waste sites, whether or not the waste was disposed of legally at the time in question. We are currently addressing environmental remediation at certain current and former facilities, and we have been named as a potentially responsible party along with other organizations in a number of environmental clean-up sites and may be named in connection with future sites. We are required to contribute to the costs of the investigation and remediation and to establish reserves in our financial statements for future costs deemed probable and estimable. Although we have estimated and reserved for future environmental remediation costs, the final resolution of these liabilities may significantly vary from our estimates and could potentially have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. We are also subject to worker health and safety requirements as well as various state and local public health laws, rules, regulations and orders related to COVID-19, including mask and social distancing requirements. While we are in compliance with government health and safety regulations related to COVID-19, the cost of complying, or failing to comply, with these regulations could have an adverse effect on our operating results.We may be subject to periodic litigation and regulatory proceedings, which may adversely affect our business and financial performance.From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions brought or threatened against us in the ordinary course of business. These actions and proceedings may involve claims for, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, workers’ compensation, employment discrimination, or breach of contract. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such actions or proceedings. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify, as plaintiffs may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts in these types of lawsuits, and the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. In addition, plaintiffs in many types of actions may seek punitive damages, civil penalties, consequential damages or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. These proceedings could result in substantial cost and may require us to devote substantial resources to defend ourselves. The ultimate resolution of these matters through settlement, mediation, or court judgment could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by climate change regulations.Climate change regulations at the federal, state, or local level or in international jurisdictions could require us to limit emissions, change our manufacturing processes, obtain substitute materials which may cost more or be less available, increase our investment in control technology for greenhouse gas emissions, fund offset projects, or undertake other costly activities. These regulations could significantly increase our costs and restrict our manufacturing operations by virtue of requirements for new equipment. New permits may be required for our current operations, or expansions thereof. Failure to timely receive permits could result in fines, suspension of production, or cessation of operations at one or more facilities. In addition, restrictions on carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas emissions could result in significant costs such as higher energy costs and the passing down of carbon taxes, emission cap and trade programs, and renewable portfolio standards by utility companies. The cost of complying, or of failing to comply, with these and other climate change and emissions regulations could have an adverse effect on our operating results.15Increasing focus on environmental, social, and governance responsibility may impose additional costs on us and expose us to new risks.Increasing focus on environmental, social, and governance responsibility may impose additional costs on us and expose us to new risks. Regulators, stockholders, and other interested constituencies have focused increasingly on the environmental, social, and governance practices of companies. Our customers may require us to implement environmental, social, or governance responsibility procedures or standards before they continue to do business with us. Additionally, we may face reputational challenges in the event that our environmental, social, or governance responsibility procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by certain constituencies. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.RISKS RELATED TO FINANCIAL MATTERSPolitical and economic changes in foreign countries and markets, including foreign currency fluctuations, may have a material effect on our operating results.During 2021, approximately 26% of our total net sales were to customers outside of the United States. Additionally, we also have operating facilities located in foreign countries. Doing business in foreign countries is subject to numerous risks, including without limitation: political and economic instability and potential for social unrest, the uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases, restrictions on the repatriation of funds, restrictive trade policies, tariff regulations, difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses, government financed competition, changes in the local labor-relations climate, economic conditions in local markets, health concerns (including the COVID-19 pandemic), complying with foreign regulatory and tax requirements that are subject to change, and limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies. While these factors or the impact of these factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations. To the extent that foreign sales are transacted in foreign currencies and we do not enter into currency hedge transactions, we are exposed to risk of losses due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly for the British Pound, Euro, and Canadian dollar. Significant fluctuations in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our cash flows and financial condition. Our business operates in many locations under government jurisdictions that impose income taxes. Changes in domestic or foreign income tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or lower income tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain revenues or the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability. The Biden administration announced in 2021 several tax proposals to fund new government investments in infrastructure, healthcare, and education, among others. Certain of these proposals involve an increase in the domestic corporate tax rate, which if implemented could have a material impact on our future results of operations and cash flows. In addition, on March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act, among other things, included certain changes in tax law intended to stimulate the U.S. economy in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, including temporary beneficial changes to the treatment of net operating losses, interest deductibility limitations, and payroll tax matters. The CARES Act is subject to interpretation and implementation guidance by both federal and state tax authorities, as well as amendments and technical corrections. Any or all of these could impact our business unfavorably. Additionally, tax rates in various jurisdictions in which we operate or sell into may increase as a means of funding the significant cost of governmental stimulus measures enacted to assist and protect individuals and businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. It cannot be predicted whether, when, in what form, or with what effective dates, new tax laws or changes in tax rates may be enacted, or regulations and rulings may be enacted, promulgated or issued under existing or new tax laws, which could result in an increase in our tax liability or require changes in the manner in which we operate in order to minimize or mitigate any adverse effects of changes in tax law or in the interpretation thereof.Furthermore, the amount of income taxes paid by us is subject to examination by U.S. federal, state, and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from such examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of any such examinations. If the ultimate determination of our taxes owed were for an amount in excess of amounts reserved, our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.We use estimates when accounting for long-term contracts. Changes in estimates could affect our profitability and overall financial position.Long-term contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total 16revenues and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. For example, assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract as costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials. Similarly, assumptions have to be made regarding the future impact of efficiency initiatives and cost reduction efforts. Incentives, awards, price escalations, liquidated damages, or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance. It is possible that materially different amounts could be obtained, because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, if different assumptions were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances, or estimates may have a material adverse effect upon future period financial reporting and performance. See “Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.Our future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairment charges.As of December 31, 2021, we had goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of approximately $2.0 billion, which represented approximately 49% of our total assets. Our goodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and is also tested whenever events and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. Intangible assets (other than goodwill) are generally amortized over the useful life of such assets. In addition, from time to time, we may acquire or make an investment in a business that will require us to record goodwill based on the purchase price and the value of the acquired assets. We may subsequently experience unforeseen issues with such business that adversely affect the anticipated returns of the business or value of the intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets for such business. For example, if the financial performance of such business was to decline significantly, we could incur a material non-cash charge to our income statement for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets. Future determinations of significant write-offs of goodwill or intangible assets as a result of an impairment test or any accelerated amortization of other intangible assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.Our current debt, and debt we may incur in the future, could adversely affect our business and financial position.As of December 31, 2021, we had $1.0 billion of debt outstanding. Our level of debt could have significant consequences for our business including: requiring us to use our cash flow to pay the principal and interest on our debt; reducing funds available for acquisitions and other investments in our business; making us vulnerable to economic downturns and increases in interest rates; limiting us from obtaining additional debt; and impacting our ability to pay dividends.We self-insure health benefits and may be adversely impacted by unfavorable claims experience.We are primarily self-insured for our health benefits. If the number or severity of claims increases, or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than our original assessment, our operating results would be adversely affected. Our future claims expense might exceed historical levels, which could reduce our earnings. We expect to periodically assess our self-insurance strategy. We are required to periodically evaluate and adjust our claims reserves to reflect our experience. However, ultimate results may differ from our estimates, which could result in losses over our reserved amounts. In addition, because we do not carry “stop loss” insurance, a significant increase in the number of claims that we must cover under our self-insurance retainage could adversely affect our profitability.Increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.Our earnings may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of income or expense we record for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. U.S. GAAP requires that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions relating to financial markets and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can change the assumptions. The most significant year-end assumptions used to estimate pension or other postretirement benefit expense for the following year are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, expected future medical cost inflation, and expected compensation increases. In addition, we are required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant change to equity through a reduction or increase to other comprehensive income. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement benefit plans accounting policies, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies—Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. Although U.S. GAAP expense and pension or other postretirement contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect U.S. GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash we would contribute to the pension or other postretirement plans. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law, Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and discretionary contributions to improve the plans’ funded status. An obligation to make contributions to pension plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses.GENERAL RISKS17Our future growth and continued success are dependent upon our key personnel.Our success is dependent upon the efforts of our senior management personnel and our ability to attract and retain other highly qualified management and technical personnel. We face competition for management and qualified technical personnel from other companies and organizations. Additionally, it is particularly difficult to hire new employees during the COVID-19 pandemic as conducting interviews remotely makes it more difficult to ensure that we are recruiting and hiring high-quality employees. Further, the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic makes it less likely that potential candidates will be willing to leave a stable job to explore a new opportunity. Therefore, we may not be able to retain our existing management and technical personnel or fill new management or technical positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover at our existing compensation levels. Although we have entered into change of control agreements with some members of senior management, we do not have employment contracts with our key executives. As some of our key executives approach retirement age, we have made a concerted effort to reduce the effect of the loss of our senior management personnel through management succession planning. However, we may be required to devote significant time and resources to identify and integrate key new personnel should key management losses occur earlier than anticipated. The loss of members of our senior management and qualified technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.On September 9, 2021, President Biden directed the Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) to issue an Emergency Temporary Standard (“ETS”) requiring that all employers with at least 100 employees ensure that their employees are fully vaccinated for COVID-19 or obtain a negative COVID-19 test at least once a week. President Biden also issued an Executive Order requiring certain COVID-19 precautions for government contractors and their subcontractors, including mandatory employee vaccination, with exemptions only for medical or religious reasons. On November 4, 2021, the OSHA issued an emergency regulation to carry out this mandate, which was expected to take effect on January 4, 2022. However, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a nationwide stay prohibiting OSHA from enforcing or implementing the ETS. But many states and localities are free to impose vaccine requirements. Despite the previous legal and timing uncertainties relating to these regulations, we implemented requirements regarding mandatory vaccines for U.S. based covered employees, subject to approved exemptions. It is possible that additional vaccine and testing mandates may be announced in other jurisdictions in which we operate our business. While it is not currently possible to predict with any certainty the exact impact any new state, local or foreign vaccine regulations would have on our operations, our suppliers and our customers, the implementation of such state, local or foreign government mandated vaccination or testing mandates may impact our ability to retain current employees, attract new employees, and result in labor disruptions and may have an adverse effect on future profitability. Further, implementation could also have similar consequences for our subcontractors, which may impact their ability to deliver the goods and services we need from them. In addition, any requirement to impose obligations on our suppliers under the Executive Order covering government contractors and their subcontractors could impact the price and continuity of supply of raw materials, whereby our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if the United States were to withdraw from or materially modify certain international trade agreements, or if tariffs or other restrictions on the foreign-sourced goods that we sell were to increase.A significant portion of our business activities are conducted in foreign countries, including Mexico and Canada. Our business benefits from free trade agreements such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement (USMCA) and relies on various U.S. corporate tax provisions related to international commerce as we build, market, and sell our products globally. Although there are no immediate effects on our operations with respect to USMCA, we cannot predict future developments in the political climate involving the United States, Mexico and Canada, and thus, these may have an adverse and material impact on our operations and financial growth. The United States and other countries have levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods (such as those implemented by the United States and China in recent years). Some of our products are included in these tariffs. All of this could lead to increased costs and diminished sales opportunities in the U.S. and abroad. Media and political reactions in the affected countries could potentially exacerbate the impact on our operations in those countries. The imposition of new or increased tariffs, duties, border adjustment taxes or other trade restrictions by the United States could also result in the adoption of new or increased tariffs or other trade restrictions by other countries. The tariffs may in the future increase our cost of materials and may cause us to increase prices to our customers which we believe may reduce demand for our products. Our price increases may not be sufficient to fully offset the impact of the tariffs and result in lowering our margin on products sold. If the U.S. government increases or implements additional tariffs, or if additional tariffs or trade restrictions are implemented by other countries, the resulting trade barriers could have a significant adverse impact on our suppliers, our customers and on our business. We are not able to predict future trade policy of the U.S. or of any foreign countries in which we operate or purchase goods, or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements, or their impact on our business. Global economic conditions may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.18Although we currently generate significant operating cash flows, which combined with access to the credit markets provides us with significant discretionary funding capacity, global macroeconomic uncertainty, including the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing trade disputes between the United States and China, the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, and uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets could affect our ability to fund our operations. In addition, certain of our customers and suppliers could be affected directly by an economic downturn and could face credit issues or cash flow problems that could give rise to payment delays, increased credit risk, bankruptcies, and other financial hardships, which could impact customer demand for our products as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers and suppliers. Depending on their severity and duration, the effects and consequences of a global economic downturn could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.A percentage of our workforce is employed under collective bargaining agreements.Approximately 7% of our workforce is employed under collective bargaining agreements, which from time to time are subject to renewal and negotiation. We cannot ensure that we will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements, that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor, or that a breakdown in such negotiations will not result in the disruption of our operations. Although we have generally enjoyed good relations with both our unionized and non-unionized employees, we may experience an adverse impact on our operating results if we are subject to labor actions.Future terror attacks, war, natural disasters, climate change-related events, pandemic diseases (including the COVID-19 pandemic), or other events beyond our control could adversely impact our businesses.Despite our concerted effort to minimize risk to our production capabilities and corporate information systems and to reduce the effect of unforeseen interruptions through insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms, such as our business continuity planning and disaster recovery plans, we could be adversely impacted by terror attacks, war, natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, climate change-related events, pandemic diseases such as COVID-19, or other events such as strikes by the workforce of a significant customer or supplier. These risks could negatively impact demand for or supply of our products and could also cause disruption to our facilities or systems, which could also interrupt operational processes and adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products and provide services and support to our customers. We operate facilities in areas of the world that are exposed to natural disasters. Financial difficulties of our customers, delays by our customers in production of their products, high fuel prices, the concern of another major terrorist attack, and the overall decreased demand for our products could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition"
6,CW,CURTISS-WRIGHT CORP,2021-02-25,"Risk Factors
.8We have summarized the known, material risks to our business below. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely impacted if any of these risks materialize. Additional risk factors not currently known to us or that we believe are immaterial may also impair our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows, and require significant management time and attention. In addition to the risks and uncertainties set forth in section below entitled “Risks Related to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic,"" many of the risks and uncertainties set forth in the other risk factors are exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, corresponding government and business responses, and any further resulting decline in the global business and economic environment, and may be impacted by the extent and speed of the global economic recovery. The risk factors below should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as other required filings by us to the Securities Exchange Commission, such as our Form 10-Q’s, Form 8-K’s, proxy statements for our annual shareholder meetings, and subsequent amendments, if any.RISKS RELATED TO THE CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) PANDEMICThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted and poses risks to our business, the nature and extent of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable.In March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic. While we continue to actively monitor the pandemic and take steps to mitigate the risks posed by its spread, there is no guarantee that our efforts will mitigate the adverse impacts of COVID-19 or will be effective.The pandemic has adversely affected, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, certain elements of our business, including our supply chain and production levels. We have experienced operational interruptions as a result of COVID-19, including the temporary suspension of operations due to government-imposed restrictions at our facilities in Mexico and India. As of December 31, 2020, all of our manufacturing operations have resumed, but we are unable to predict if there will be additional government-imposed restrictions on our ability to operate in future periods. Additionally, certain portions of our workforce might not be able to work effectively due to quarantines, government orders and guidance, travel restrictions, and other precautionary measures and restrictions. This could have an adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of such manufacturing facilities, which could in turn adversely impact our business and operations.We also have experienced and expect to continue to experience unpredictable volatility in demand in our commercial aerospace and general industrial end markets. Several countries, including the United States, have taken steps to restrict air travel, along with many companies, including us, adopting policies which prohibit non-essential business travel by their employees. Even in the absence of formal restrictions and prohibitions, contagious illness and fear of contagion adversely affects travel behavior. Approximately 14% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 were derived from sales to commercial aerospace customers. Current travel restrictions, as well as changes in the propensity for the general public to travel by air as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, have caused reductions in demand for commercial aircraft, which will adversely impact our net sales and operating results and may continue to do so for an extended period of time. In addition, an overall reduction in business activity as a result of the disruption caused by COVID-19 has led to a decrease in sales to our general industrial market, which primarily includes industrial vehicle and industrial valve products. Approximately 20% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 were derived from sales to our general industrial market. While we are unable to predict the magnitude of such impact at this time, the loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by our large commercial aircraft manufacturers and general industrial customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.If the pandemic continues and conditions worsen, we may continue to experience additional adverse impacts on our operational and commercial activities, costs, customer orders, and collections of accounts receivable, which may be material. In addition, we may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by business disruptions, performance delays or interruptions, or payment defaults or bankruptcy of our third-party customers and suppliers, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the pandemic has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth. Due to the speed with which the situation is developing, the global breadth of its spread and the range of governmental and community reactions thereto, there is uncertainty around its duration, ultimate impact, and the timing of recovery. Therefore, the pandemic could lead to an extended disruption of economic activity whereby the impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be material.RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONSIntrusion on our systems could damage our business.We store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, and confidential employee information on our servers and databases. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused us to modify our business practices, including 9requiring many of our office-based associates to work from home. As a result, we are increasingly dependent upon our information systems to operate our business. Our ability to effectively manage our business depends on the security, reliability, and adequacy of our information systems. In addition, various privacy and securities laws require us to manage and protect sensitive and confidential information, including personal data of our employees, from disclosure. For example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective in May 2018, extends the scope of the European Union data protection laws to all companies processing data of European Union residents, regardless of the company's location. Despite our implementation of firewalls, switchgear, and other network security measures, our servers, databases, and other systems may be vulnerable to computer hackers, physical or electronic break-ins, sabotage, computer viruses, worms, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. We continue to review and enhance our computer systems as well as provide training to our employees in an attempt to prevent unauthorized and unlawful intrusions, but in the future, it is possible that we may not be able to prevent all intrusions. Such intrusions could result in our network security or computer systems being compromised and possibly result in the misappropriation or corruption of sensitive information or cause disruptions in our services. While we carry cyber insurance, we still may be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against, remediate, or alleviate problems caused by such intrusions. Any such intrusion could cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subject us to legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Potential product liability risks exist from the products that we sell.We may be exposed to liabilities for personal injury, death, or property damage due to the failure of a product that we have sold. We typically agree to indemnify our customers against certain liabilities resulting from the products we sell, and any third-party indemnification we seek from our suppliers and our liability insurance may not fully cover our indemnification obligations to customers. We may also not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Any liability for which third-party indemnification is not available that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.In addition, an accident caused by one of our products could damage our reputation for selling quality products. We believe that our customers consider safety and reliability as key criteria in selecting our products and believe that our reputation for quality assurance is a significant competitive strength. If an accident were to be caused by one of our products, or if we were to otherwise fail to maintain a satisfactory record of safety and reliability, our ability to retain and attract customers may be materially adversely affected.We are subject to liability under warranty obligations.The majority of our contracts contain provisions which expose us to potential liability for warranty claims made by customers or third parties with respect to products that have been designed, manufactured, or serviced by us or our suppliers. Material product warranty obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, our reputation may be adversely affected by such defective product claims, whether or not successful, including potential negative publicity about our products.If we fail to satisfy our contractual obligations, our contracts may be terminated and we may incur significant costs or liabilities, including liquidated damages and penalties.In general, our contracts may be terminated for our failure to satisfy our contractual obligations. In addition, some of our contracts contain substantial liquidated damages provisions and financial penalties related to our failure to satisfy our contractual obligations. For example, the terms of the Electro-Mechanical Division's AP1000 China and AP1000 U.S. contracts with Westinghouse Electric Company (WEC) include liquidated damage penalty provisions for failure to meet contractual delivery dates if we caused the delay and the delay was not excusable.  On October 10, 2013, we received a letter from WEC stating entitlements to the maximum amount of liquidated damages allowable under the AP1000 China contract of approximately $25 million. To date, we have not met certain contractual delivery dates under our AP1000 U.S. and China contracts; however, there are significant counterclaims and uncertainties as to which parties are responsible for the delays.  In January 2021, we agreed to participate in formal non-binding mediation with WEC. We believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. However, as of December 31, 2020, the range of possible loss for these matters is $0 to $55.5 million.Our earnings and margins depend in part on subcontractor performance, as well as raw material and component availability and pricing.Our businesses depend on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials and components. At times subcontractors perform services that we provide to our customers. Our supply chain has been and may continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 10pandemic. We depend on these subcontractors and suppliers to meet their contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements. Nonperformance or underperformance by subcontractors and suppliers could materially impact our ability to perform obligations to our customers, which could result in a customer terminating our contract for default, expose us to liability, and substantially impair our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. Generally, raw materials and purchased components are available from a number of different suppliers, though several suppliers are our sole source of certain components. If a sole-source supplier should cease or otherwise be unable to deliver such components, our operating results could be adversely impacted. In addition, our supply networks can sometimes experience price fluctuations. Our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor may be adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers are unable to provide the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner. While we have attempted to mitigate the effects of increased costs through price increases, there are no assurances that higher prices can effectively be passed through to our customers or that we will be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw materials costs through price increases on a timely basis.Our business involves risks associated with complex manufacturing processes.Our manufacturing processes depend on certain sophisticated and high-value equipment. Unexpected failures of this equipment may result in production delays, revenue loss, and significant repair costs. In addition, equipment failures could result in injuries to our employees. Moreover, the competitive nature of our businesses requires us to continuously implement process changes intended to achieve product improvements and manufacturing efficiencies. These process changes may at times result in production delays, quality concerns, and increased costs. Any disruption of operations at our facilities due to equipment failures or process interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business.RISKS RELATED TO OUR STRATEGYImplementing our acquisition strategy involves risks, and our failure to successfully implement this strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business.As part of our capital allocation strategy, we aim to grow our business by selectively pursuing acquisitions to supplement our organic growth.  We are continuing to actively pursue additional acquisition opportunities, some of which may be material to our business and financial performance.  Although we have been successful with this strategy in the past, we may not be able to grow our business in the future through acquisitions for several reasons, including:•Encountering difficulties identifying and executing acquisitions; •Increased competition for targets, which may increase acquisition costs;•Consolidation in our industry, reducing the number of acquisition targets;•Competition laws and regulations preventing us from making certain acquisitions; and•Acquisition financing not being available on acceptable terms, or at all.In addition, there are potential risks associated with growing our business through acquisitions, including the failure to successfully integrate and realize the expected benefits of an acquisition, which could be exacerbated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.  For example, with any past or future acquisition, there is the possibility that:•The business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture;•Technological and product synergies, economies of scale, or cost reductions may not occur as expected;•Management may be distracted from overseeing existing operations by the need to integrate acquired businesses;•We may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities;•We may experience unforeseen difficulties in integrating operations and systems;•We may fail to retain or assimilate employees of the acquired business;•We may experience problems in retaining customers or integrating customer bases; and•We may encounter difficulties in entering new markets in which we may have little or no experience.11Failure to successfully implement our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop new technologies.Virtually all products produced and sold by us are highly engineered and require sophisticated manufacturing and system-integration techniques and capabilities. The commercial and government markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies. The product and program needs of our government and commercial customers change and evolve regularly. Accordingly, our future performance depends in part on our ability to: identify emerging technological trends in our current and target markets; develop and manufacture competitive products, systems, and services; enhance our offerings by adding technological innovations that differentiate our products, systems, and services from those of our competitors; and develop, manufacture, and bring those products, systems, and service to market quickly at cost-effective prices. We operate in highly competitive markets.Many of our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets and are affected by varying degrees of competition. We compete against companies that often have higher sales volumes and greater financial, technological, research and development, human, and marketing resources than we have. As a result, they may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns. In addition, some of our largest customers could develop the capability to manufacture products or provide services similar to products that we manufacture or services that we provide. This would result in these customers supplying their own products or services and competing directly with us for sales of these products or services, all of which could significantly reduce our revenues. Furthermore, we are facing increased international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition. Our management believes that the principal points of competition in our markets are technology, product quality, product performance, price, technical expertise, timeliness of delivery, superior customer service and support, and continued certification under customer quality requirements and assurance programs. If we are unable to compete successfully with existing or new competitors in these areas, we may experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.We may be unable to protect the value of our intellectual property.Obtaining, maintaining, and enforcing our intellectual property rights and avoiding infringing on the intellectual property rights of others are important factors to the operation of our business. While we take precautionary steps to protect our technological advantages and intellectual property and rely in part on patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright laws, we cannot assure that the precautionary steps we have taken will completely protect our intellectual property rights. Because patent applications in the United States are maintained in secrecy until either the patent application is published or a patent is issued, we may not be aware of third-party patents, patent applications, and other intellectual property relevant to our products that may block our use of our intellectual property or may be used in third-party products that compete with our products and processes. When others infringe on our intellectual property rights, the value of our products is diminished, and we may incur substantial litigation costs to enforce our rights. Similarly, we may incur substantial litigation costs and the obligation to pay royalties if others claim we infringed on their intellectual property rights. When we develop intellectual property and technologies with funding from U.S. Government contracts, the government has the royalty-free right to use that property.In addition to our patent rights, we also rely on unpatented technology, trade secrets, and confidential information. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques or otherwise gain access to or disclose our technology. We may not be able to protect our rights in unpatented technology, trade secrets, and confidential information effectively. We generally require each of our employees and consultants to execute a confidentiality agreement at the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us. There is no guarantee that we will succeed in obtaining and retaining executed agreements from all employees or consultants. Moreover, these agreements may not provide effective protection of our information or, in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure, they may not provide adequate remedies.RISKS RELATED TO MARKET CONDITIONSA substantial portion of our revenues and earnings depends upon the continued willingness of the U.S. Government and other customers in the defense industry to buy our products and services.In 2020, approximately 47% of our total net sales were derived from or related to U.S. defense programs.  U.S. defense spending has historically been cyclical, and defense budgets tend to rise when perceived threats to national security increase the level of concern over the country’s safety. At other times, spending by the military can decrease. In August 2011, Congress enacted the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA), which imposed spending caps and certain reductions in defense spending over 12a ten-year period through 2021. These spending caps and reductions, referred to as sequestration, went into effect in March 2013. Through a series of bipartisan agreements, Congress has been able to temporarily lift discretionary spending limits every year through 2019.  On August 2, 2019, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 (BBA) was signed into law, which raised the BCA budget caps for both defense and non-defense spending in 2020 and 2021. The BBA also temporarily suspends the public debt limit through July 31, 2021. However, the BCA remains in place, extended through 2029. Absent additional legislative or other remedial action, the sequestration could require reduced U.S. federal government spending from fiscal 2022 through fiscal 2029. As a result of this uncertainty, a decrease in U.S. Government defense spending or changes in spending allocation could result in one or more of our programs being reduced, delayed, or terminated. In the event that one or more of our programs are reduced, delayed, or terminated for which we provide products and services and are not offset by revenues from foreign sales, new programs, or products or services that we currently manufacture or provide, we may experience a reduction in our revenues and earnings and a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.A downturn in the aircraft market could adversely affect our business.Our sales to large commercial aircraft manufacturers are cyclical in nature and can be adversely affected by a number of factors, including current and future passenger traffic levels, increasing fuel and labor costs, intense price competition, the retirement of older aircraft, regulatory changes, outbreak of infectious disease such as the COVID-19 pandemic, terrorist attacks, general economic conditions, worldwide airline profits, and backlog levels, all of which can be unpredictable and are outside our control. Any decrease in demand resulting from a downturn in the aerospace market could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our backlog is subject to reduction and cancellation, which could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.Backlog represents products or services that our customers have contractually committed to purchase from us. Total backlog includes both funded (unfilled orders for which funding is authorized, appropriated, and contractually obligated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated and/or contractually obligated by the customer). We are a subcontractor to prime contractors for the vast majority of our government business; as such, substantially all amounts in backlog are funded. Backlog excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering type contracts (e.g. Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity). Backlog is adjusted for changes in foreign exchange rates and is reduced for contract cancellations and terminations in the period in which they occur. Backlog as of December 31, 2020 was $2.2 billion. Backlog is subject to fluctuations and is not necessarily indicative of future sales. The timing of backlog may be impacted by project delays. The U.S. Government may unilaterally modify or cancel its contracts. In addition, under certain of our commercial contracts, our customers may unilaterally modify or terminate their orders at any time for their convenience. Accordingly, certain portions of our backlog can be cancelled or reduced at the option of the U.S. Government and commercial customers. We believe that these risks are heightened due to the global economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our failure to replace cancelled or reduced backlog could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.RISKS RELATED TO LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERSAs a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to numerous procurement rules and regulations.We must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business. A violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, the termination of our contracts, or debarment from bidding on contracts. These fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards, receiving or paying kickbacks, or filing false claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies. The failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation. It could also result in our progress payments being withheld. In some instances, these laws and regulations impose terms or rights that are more favorable to the government than those typically available to commercial parties in negotiated transactions. For example, the U.S. Government may terminate any of our government contracts and, in general, subcontracts, at its convenience as well as for default based on performance. Upon termination for convenience of a fixed-price type contract, we normally are entitled to receive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement for allowable costs for work-in-process, and an allowance for profit on work actually completed on the contract or adjustment for loss if completion of performance would have resulted in a loss. Upon termination for convenience of a cost reimbursement contract, we normally are entitled to reimbursement of allowable costs plus a portion of the fee. Such allowable costs would normally include our cost to terminate agreements with our suppliers and subcontractors. The amount of the fee recovered, if any, is related to the portion of the work accomplished prior to termination and is determined by negotiation.A termination arising out of our default could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. In addition, on those contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor, the U.S. 13Government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor, irrespective of the quality of our services as a subcontractor.Our U.S. Government contracts typically span one or more base years and multiple option years. The U.S. Government generally has the right to not exercise option periods and may not exercise an option period if the agency is not satisfied with our performance on the contract or does not receive funding to continue the program. U.S. Government procurement may adversely affect our cash flow or program profitability.Furthermore, we are subject to other risks in connection with government contracts, including without limitation:•the frequent need to bid on programs prior to completing the necessary design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and/or cost overruns;•the difficulty in forecasting long-term costs and schedules and the potential obsolescence of products related to long-term, fixed price contracts;•contracts with varying fixed terms that may not be renewed or followed by follow-on contracts upon expiration;•cancellation of the follow-on production phase of contracts if program requirements are not met in the development phase; and•the fact that government contract wins can be contested by other contractors.Our operations are subject to numerous domestic and international laws, regulations, and restrictions. Noncompliance with these laws, regulations, and restrictions could expose us to fines, penalties, suspension, or debarment, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and overall financial condition.We have contracts and operations in many parts of the world subject to United States and foreign laws and regulations, including the False Claims Act, regulations relating to import-export control (including the International Traffic in Arms Regulation promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act), sanctions programs implemented by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of Treasury, technology transfer restrictions, repatriation of earnings, exchange controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act, and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act.  Because the COVID-19 pandemic has so negatively impacted local economies, government intervention has increased, which in turn can create elevated risk and opportunity for corruption. Although we have implemented policies and procedures and provided training that we believe are sufficient to address these risks, we cannot guarantee that our operations will always comply with these laws and regulations. From time to time, we may file voluntary disclosure reports with the U.S. Department of State, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Commerce regarding certain violations of U.S. export control laws and regulations discovered by us in the course of our business activities, employee training, or internal reviews and audits. To date, our voluntary disclosures have not resulted in a fine, penalty, or export privilege denial or restriction that has had a material adverse impact on our financial condition or ability to export. Our failure, or failure by our sales representatives or consultants to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities and could, in the extreme case, result in suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.The airline industry is heavily regulated, and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements, our results of operations could suffer.Governmental agencies throughout the world, including the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the European Aviation Safety Agency, prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components, including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although compliance with FAA requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries. We include documentation with our products sold to aircraft manufacturing customers certifying that each part complies with applicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. In order to sell our products, the Corporation as well as the products we manufacture must also be certified by our individual original equipment manufacturers (OEM) customers. If any of the material authorizations or approvals qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended, then the sale of such product would be prohibited by law, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.From time to time, the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations, which are usually more stringent than existing regulations. If these proposed regulations are adopted and enacted, 14we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.We are subject to liability under environmental and health and safety laws and regulations.Our business and facilities are subject to numerous federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to the use, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials and other waste products. Environmental laws generally impose liability for investigation, remediation, and removal of hazardous materials and other waste products on property owners and those who dispose of materials at waste sites, whether or not the waste was disposed of legally at the time in question. We are currently addressing environmental remediation at certain current and former facilities, and we have been named as a potentially responsible party along with other organizations in a number of environmental clean-up sites and may be named in connection with future sites. We are required to contribute to the costs of the investigation and remediation and to establish reserves in our financial statements for future costs deemed probable and estimable. Although we have estimated and reserved for future environmental remediation costs, the final resolution of these liabilities may significantly vary from our estimates and could potentially have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. We are also subject to worker health and safety requirements as well as various state and local public health laws, rules, regulations and orders related to COVID-19, including mask and social distancing requirements. While we are in compliance with government health and safety regulations related to COVID-19, the cost of complying, or failing to comply, with these regulations could have an adverse effect on our operating results.Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by climate change regulations.Climate change regulations at the federal, state, or local level or in international jurisdictions could require us to limit emissions, change our manufacturing processes, obtain substitute materials which may cost more or be less available, increase our investment in control technology for greenhouse gas emissions, fund offset projects, or undertake other costly activities. These regulations could significantly increase our costs and restrict our manufacturing operations by virtue of requirements for new equipment. New permits may be required for our current operations, or expansions thereof. Failure to timely receive permits could result in fines, suspension of production, or cessation of operations at one or more facilities. In addition, restrictions on carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas emissions could result in significant costs such as higher energy costs and the passing down of carbon taxes, emission cap and trade programs, and renewable portfolio standards by utility companies. The cost of complying, or of failing to comply, with these and other climate change and emissions regulations could have an adverse effect on our operating results.Increasing focus on environmental, social, and governance responsibility may impose additional costs on us and expose us to new risks.Increasing focus on environmental, social, and governance responsibility may impose additional costs on us and expose us to new risks. Regulators, stockholders, and other interested constituencies have focused increasingly on the environmental, social, and governance practices of companies. Our customers may require us to implement environmental, social, or governance responsibility procedures or standards before they continue to do business with us. Additionally, we may face reputational challenges in the event that our environmental, social, or governance responsibility procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by certain constituencies. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.RISKS RELATED TO FINANCIAL MATTERSPolitical and economic changes in foreign countries and markets, including foreign currency fluctuations, may have a material effect on our operating results.During 2020, approximately 26% of our total net sales were to customers outside of the United States. Additionally, we also have operating facilities located in foreign countries. Doing business in foreign countries is subject to numerous risks, including without limitation: political and economic instability, the uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases, restrictive trade policies, changes in the local labor-relations climate, economic conditions in local markets, health concerns, and complying with foreign regulatory and tax requirements that are subject to change. While these factors or the impact of these factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations. To the extent that foreign sales are transacted in foreign currencies and we do not enter into currency hedge transactions, we are exposed to risk of losses due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly for the British Pound, Euro, and Canadian dollar. Significant fluctuations in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.15Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our cash flows and financial condition. Our business operates in many locations under government jurisdictions that impose income taxes. Changes in domestic or foreign income tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or lower income tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain revenues or the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act, among other things, included certain changes in tax law intended to stimulate the U.S. economy in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, including temporary beneficial changes to the treatment of net operating losses, interest deductibility limitations. and payroll tax matters.  The CARES Act is subject to interpretation and implementation guidance by both federal and state tax authorities, as well as amendments and technical corrections. Any or all of these could impact our business unfavorably. Additionally, tax rates in various jurisdictions in which we operate or sell into may increase as a means of funding the significant cost of governmental stimulus measures enacted to assist and protect individuals and businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. It cannot be predicted whether, when, in what form, or with what effective dates, new tax laws or changes in tax rates may be enacted, or regulations and rulings may be enacted, promulgated or issued under existing or new tax laws, which could result in an increase in our tax liability or require changes in the manner in which we operate in order to minimize or mitigate any adverse effects of changes in tax law or in the interpretation thereof. Furthermore, the amount of income taxes paid by us is subject to examination by U.S. federal, state, and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from such examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of any such examinations. If the ultimate determination of our taxes owed were for an amount in excess of amounts reserved, our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.We use estimates when accounting for long-term contracts. Changes in estimates could affect our profitability and overall financial position.Long-term contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. For example, assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract as costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials. Similarly, assumptions have to be made regarding the future impact of efficiency initiatives and cost reduction efforts. Incentives, awards, price escalations, liquidated damages, or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance. It is possible that materially different amounts could be obtained, because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, if different assumptions were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances, or estimates may have a material adverse effect upon future period financial reporting and performance. See “Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.Our future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairment charges.As of December 31, 2020, we had goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of approximately $2,065 million, which represented approximately 51% of our total assets. Our goodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and is also tested whenever events and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. Intangible assets (other than goodwill) are generally amortized over the useful life of such assets. In addition, from time to time, we may acquire or make an investment in a business that will require us to record goodwill based on the purchase price and the value of the acquired assets. We may subsequently experience unforeseen issues with such business that adversely affect the anticipated returns of the business or value of the intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets for such business. For example, if the financial performance of such business was to decline significantly, we could incur a material non-cash charge to our income statement for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets.  Future determinations of significant write-offs of goodwill or intangible assets as a result of an impairment test or any accelerated amortization of other intangible assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.Our current debt, and debt we may incur in the future, could adversely affect our business and financial position.As of December 31, 2020, we had $1,058 million of debt outstanding. Our level of debt could have significant consequences for our business including: requiring us to use our cash flow to pay the principal and interest on our debt; reducing funds available for acquisitions and other investments in our business; making us vulnerable to economic downturns and increases in interest rates; limiting us from obtaining additional debt; and impacting our ability to pay dividends.16We self-insure health benefits and may be adversely impacted by unfavorable claims experience.We are primarily self-insured for our health benefits. If the number or severity of claims increases, or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than our original assessment, our operating results would be adversely affected. Our future claims expense might exceed historical levels, which could reduce our earnings. We expect to periodically assess our self-insurance strategy. We are required to periodically evaluate and adjust our claims reserves to reflect our experience. However, ultimate results may differ from our estimates, which could result in losses over our reserved amounts. In addition, because we do not carry “stop loss” insurance, a significant increase in the number of claims that we must cover under our self-insurance retainage could adversely affect our profitability.Increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.Our earnings may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of income or expense we record for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. U.S. GAAP requires that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions relating to financial markets and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can change the assumptions. The most significant year-end assumptions used to estimate pension or other postretirement benefit expense for the following year are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, expected future medical cost inflation, and expected compensation increases. In addition, we are required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant change to equity through a reduction or increase to other comprehensive income. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement benefit plans accounting policies, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies—Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.  Although U.S. GAAP expense and pension or other postretirement contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect U.S. GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash we would contribute to the pension or other postretirement plans. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law, Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and discretionary contributions to improve the plans’ funded status. An obligation to make contributions to pension plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses.GENERAL RISKSOur future growth and continued success is dependent upon our key personnel.Our success is dependent upon the efforts of our senior management personnel and our ability to attract and retain other highly qualified management and technical personnel. We face competition for management and qualified technical personnel from other companies and organizations. Additionally, it is particularly difficult to hire new employees during the COVID-19 pandemic as conducting interviews remotely makes it more difficult to ensure that we are recruiting and hiring high-quality employees. Further, the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic makes it less likely that potential candidates will be willing to leave a stable job to explore a new opportunity. Therefore, we may not be able to retain our existing management and technical personnel or fill new management or technical positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover at our existing compensation levels. Although we have entered into change of control agreements with some members of senior management, we do not have employment contracts with our key executives. As some of our key executives approach retirement age, we have made a concerted effort to reduce the effect of the loss of our senior management personnel through management succession planning. However, we may be required to devote significant time and resources to identify and integrate key new personnel should key management losses occur earlier than anticipated. The loss of members of our senior management and qualified technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if the United States were to withdraw from or materially modify certain international trade agreements, or if tariffs or other restrictions on the foreign-sourced goods that we sell were to increase.A significant portion of our business activities are conducted in foreign countries, including Mexico and Canada. Our business benefits from free trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and also relies on various U.S. corporate tax provisions related to international commerce as we build, market, and sell our products globally. The U.S. federal government has altered U.S. international trade policy and has indicated its intention to renegotiate or terminate certain existing trade agreements and treaties with foreign governments. On November 30, 2018, the U.S. reached an agreement with Canada and Mexico on the United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement (USMCA), which replaced NAFTA. The USMCA was ratified by all three countries and became effective on July 1, 2020. The USMCA maintains duty-free access for most products and leaves most key provisions of the NAFTA agreement largely intact. Although we have determined that there have been no immediate effects on our operations with respect to USMCA, we cannot predict future developments in the political 17climate involving the United States, Mexico and Canada, and thus, these may have an adverse and material impact on our operations and financial growth. The United States and other countries have levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods. General trade tensions between the United States and China have been escalating since 2018, with U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods and retaliatory Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods. Some of our products are included in these tariffs. Despite the execution of the trade deal between the U.S. and China in January 2020, tariffs in some cases will remain in place, albeit at a lower rate. All of this could lead to increased costs and diminished sales opportunities in the U.S. and China markets. Media and political reactions in the affected countries could potentially exacerbate the impact on our operations in those countries. The imposition of new or increased tariffs, duties, border adjustment taxes or other trade restrictions by the United States could also result in the adoption of new or increased tariffs or other trade restrictions by other countries. The tariffs may in the future increase our cost of materials and may cause us to increase prices to our customers which we believe may reduce demand for our products. Our price increases may not be sufficient to fully offset the impact of the tariffs and result in lowering our margin on products sold. If the U.S. government increases or implements additional tariffs, or if additional tariffs or trade restrictions are implemented by other countries, the resulting trade barriers could have a significant adverse impact on our suppliers, our customers and on our business. We are not able to predict future trade policy of the U.S. or of any foreign countries in which we operate or purchase goods, or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements, or their impact on our business. Global economic conditions may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.Although we currently generate significant operating cash flows, which combined with access to the credit markets provides us with significant discretionary funding capacity, global macroeconomic uncertainty, including the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing trade disputes between the United States and China, the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, and uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets could affect our ability to fund our operations. In addition, certain of our customers and suppliers could be affected directly by an economic downturn and could face credit issues or cash flow problems that could give rise to payment delays, increased credit risk, bankruptcies, and other financial hardships, which could impact customer demand for our products as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers and suppliers. Depending on their severity and duration, the effects and consequences of a global economic downturn could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.A percentage of our workforce is employed under collective bargaining agreements.Approximately 7% of our workforce is employed under collective bargaining agreements, which from time to time are subject to renewal and negotiation. We cannot ensure that we will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements, that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor, or that a breakdown in such negotiations will not result in the disruption of our operations. Although we have generally enjoyed good relations with both our unionized and non-unionized employees, we may experience an adverse impact on our operating results if we are subject to labor actions.Future terror attacks, war, natural disasters, pandemic diseases (including the COVID-19 pandemic), or other events beyond our control could adversely impact our businesses.Despite our concerted effort to minimize risk to our production capabilities and corporate information systems and to reduce the effect of unforeseen interruptions through business continuity planning and disaster recovery plans, we could be adversely impacted by terror attacks, war, natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, pandemic diseases such as COVID-19, or other events such as strikes by the workforce of a significant customer or supplier. These risks could negatively impact demand for or supply of our products and could also cause disruption to our facilities or systems, which could also interrupt operational processes and adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products and provide services and support to our customers. We operate facilities in areas of the world that are exposed to natural disasters. Financial difficulties of our customers, delays by our customers in production of their products, high fuel prices, the concern of another major terrorist attack, and the overall decreased demand for our products could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition"
15,CW,CURTISS-WRIGHT CORP,2020-02-27,"Risk Factors
.We have summarized the known, material risks to our business below. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely impacted if any of these risks materialize. Additional risk factors not currently known to us or that we believe are immaterial may also impair our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows. The risk factors below should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as other required filings by us to the Securities Exchange Commission, such as our Form 10-Q’s, Form 8-K’s, proxy statements for our annual shareholder meetings, and subsequent amendments, if any.Intrusion on our systems could damage our business.8We store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, and confidential employee information on our servers and databases. Various privacy and securities laws require us to manage and protect sensitive and confidential information, including personal data of our employees, from disclosure. For example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective in May 2018, extends the scope of the European Union data protection laws to all companies processing data of European Union residents, regardless of the company's location. Despite our implementation of firewalls, switchgear, and other network security measures, our servers, databases, and other systems may be vulnerable to computer hackers, physical or electronic break-ins, sabotage, computer viruses, worms, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. We continue to review and enhance our computer systems as well as provide training to our employees in an attempt to prevent unauthorized and unlawful intrusions, but in the future it is possible that we may not be able to prevent all intrusions. Such intrusions could result in our network security or computer systems being compromised and possibly result in the misappropriation or corruption of sensitive information or cause disruptions in our services. While we carry cyber insurance, we still may be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against, remediate, or alleviate problems caused by such intrusions. Any such intrusion could cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subject us to legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our future growth and continued success is dependent upon our key personnel.Our success is dependent upon the efforts of our senior management personnel and our ability to attract and retain other highly qualified management and technical personnel. We face competition for management and qualified technical personnel from other companies and organizations. Therefore, we may not be able to retain our existing management and technical personnel or fill new management or technical positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover at our existing compensation levels. Although we have entered into change of control agreements with some members of senior management, we do not have employment contracts with our key executives. As some of our key executives approach retirement age, we have made a concerted effort to reduce the effect of the loss of our senior management personnel through management succession planning. However, we may be required to devote significant time and resources to identify and integrate key new personnel should key management losses occur earlier than anticipated. The loss of members of our senior management and qualified technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.Implementing our acquisition strategy involves risks, and our failure to successfully implement this strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business.As part of our capital allocation strategy, we aim to grow our business by selectively pursuing acquisitions to supplement our organic growth.  We are continuing to actively pursue additional acquisition opportunities, some of which may be material to our business and financial performance.  Although we have been successful with this strategy in the past, we may not be able to grow our business in the future through acquisitions for a number of reasons, including:•Encountering difficulties identifying and executing acquisitions;•Increased competition for targets, which may increase acquisition costs;•Consolidation in our industry, reducing the number of acquisition targets;•Competition laws and regulations preventing us from making certain acquisitions; and•Acquisition financing not being available on acceptable terms or at all.In addition, there are potential risks associated with growing our business through acquisitions, including the failure to successfully integrate and realize the expected benefits of an acquisition.  For example, with any past or future acquisition, there is the possibility that:•The business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture;•Technological and product synergies, economies of scale, or cost reductions may not occur as expected;•Management may be distracted from overseeing existing operations by the need to integrate acquired businesses;9•We may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities;•We may experience unforeseen difficulties in integrating operations and systems;•We may fail to retain or assimilate employees of the acquired business;•We may experience problems in retaining customers or integrating customer bases; and•We may encounter difficulties in entering new markets in which we may have little or no experience.Failure to successfully implement our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if the United States were to withdraw from or materially modify certain international trade agreements, or if tariffs or other restrictions on the foreign-sourced goods that we sell were to increase.A significant portion of our business activities are conducted in foreign countries, including Mexico and Canada. Our business benefits from free trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and also relies on various U.S. corporate tax provisions related to international commerce as we build, market, and sell our products globally. On November 30, 2018, President Trump signed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) to replace NAFTA. The USMCA maintains duty-free access for most products and leaves most key provisions of the NAFTA agreement largely intact. The USMCA has been approved by the U.S. and Mexico, but still requires approval by Canada’s Parliament before becoming effective. Additionally, in December 2018, President Trump announced his intention for the United States to withdraw from NAFTA.  The outcome of the approval process is uncertain, but it is possible that withdrawal from NAFTA or failure of Canada’s Parliament to approve the USMCA could cause an increase in customs duties. This in turn could adversely affect intercompany transactions among our operating subsidiaries in Canada, Mexico, and the U.S., as well as increase transaction costs with third-party suppliers and customers. Furthermore, the current administration has threatened to impose more stringent trade terms with China and other countries. Despite the execution of the trade deal between the U.S. and China in January 2020, tariffs in some cases will remain in place, albeit at a lower rate. All of this could lead to increased costs and diminished sales opportunities in the U.S. and China markets. Media and political reactions in the affected countries could potentially exacerbate the impact on our operations in those countries. The U.S. Administration’s assertive trade policies could result in further conflicts with U.S. trading partners, which could affect our supply chains, sourcing, and markets. Foreign countries may impose additional burdens on us through the use of local regulations, tariffs, or other requirements, which could increase our operating costs in those foreign jurisdictions. At this time, it remains unclear what actions, if any, President Trump will take with respect to other international trade agreements as well as U.S. tax provisions related to international commerce. A substantial portion of our revenues and earnings depends upon the continued willingness of the U.S. Government and other customers in the defense industry to buy our products and services.In 2019, approximately 38% of our total net sales were derived from or related to U.S. defense programs.  U.S. defense spending has historically been cyclical, and defense budgets tend to rise when perceived threats to national security increase the level of concern over the country’s safety. At other times, spending by the military can decrease. In August 2011, Congress enacted the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA), which imposed spending caps and certain reductions in defense spending over a ten-year period through 2021. These spending caps and reductions, referred to as sequestration, went into effect in March 2013. Through a series of bipartisan agreements, Congress has been able to temporarily lift discretionary spending limits every year through 2019.  On August 2, 2019, President Trump signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 (BBA) into law, which raised the BCA budget caps for both defense and non-defense spending in 2020 and 2021. The BBA also temporarily suspends the public debt limit through July 31, 2021. However, the BCA remains in place, extended through 2029. Absent additional legislative or other remedial action, the sequestration could require reduced U.S. federal government spending from fiscal 2022 through fiscal 2029. As a result of this uncertainty, a decrease in U.S. Government defense spending or changes in spending allocation could result in one or more of our programs being reduced, delayed, or terminated. In the event that one or more of our programs are reduced, delayed, or terminated for which we provide products and services and are not offset by revenues from foreign sales, new programs, or products or services that we currently manufacture or provide, we may experience a reduction in our revenues and earnings and a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.10As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations.We must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business. A violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, the termination of our contracts, or debarment from bidding on contracts. These fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards, receiving or paying kickbacks, or filing false claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies. The failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation. It could also result in our progress payments being withheld. In some instances, these laws and regulations impose terms or rights that are more favorable to the government than those typically available to commercial parties in negotiated transactions. For example, the U.S. Government may terminate any of our government contracts and, in general, subcontracts, at its convenience as well as for default based on performance. Upon termination for convenience of a fixed-price type contract, we normally are entitled to receive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement for allowable costs for work-in-process, and an allowance for profit on work actually completed on the contract or adjustment for loss if completion of performance would have resulted in a loss. Upon termination for convenience of a cost reimbursement contract, we normally are entitled to reimbursement of allowable costs plus a portion of the fee. Such allowable costs would normally include our cost to terminate agreements with our suppliers and subcontractors. The amount of the fee recovered, if any, is related to the portion of the work accomplished prior to termination and is determined by negotiation.A termination arising out of our default could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. In addition, on those contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor, the U.S. Government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor, irrespective of the quality of our services as a subcontractor.Our U.S. Government contracts typically span one or more base years and multiple option years. The U.S. Government generally has the right to not exercise option periods and may not exercise an option period if the agency is not satisfied with our performance on the contract or does not receive funding to continue the program. U.S. Government procurement may adversely affect our cash flow or program profitability.Furthermore, we are subject to other risks in connection with government contracts, including without limitation:•the frequent need to bid on programs prior to completing the necessary design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and/or cost overruns;•the difficulty in forecasting long-term costs and schedules and the potential obsolescence of products related to long-term, fixed price contracts;•contracts with varying fixed terms that may not be renewed or followed by follow-on contracts upon expiration;•cancellation of the follow-on production phase of contracts if program requirements are not met in the development phase; and•the fact that government contract wins can be contested by other contractors.Our operations are subject to numerous domestic and international laws, regulations, and restrictions. Noncompliance with these laws, regulations, and restrictions could expose us to fines, penalties, suspension, or debarment, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and overall financial condition.We have contracts and operations in many parts of the world subject to United States and foreign laws and regulations, including the False Claims Act, regulations relating to import-export control (including the International Traffic in Arms Regulation promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act), technology transfer restrictions, repatriation of earnings, exchange controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act, and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act.  Although we have implemented policies and procedures and provided training that we believe are sufficient to address these risks, we cannot guarantee that our operations will always comply with these laws and regulations. From time to time, we may file voluntary disclosure reports with the U.S. Department of State, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Commerce regarding certain violations of U.S. export control laws and regulations discovered by us in the course of our business activities, employee training, or internal reviews and audits. To date, our voluntary disclosures have not resulted in a fine, penalty, or export privilege denial or restriction that has had a material adverse impact on 11our financial condition or ability to export. Our failure, or failure by our sales representatives or consultants to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities and could, in the extreme case, result in suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.The airline industry is heavily regulated, and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements, our results of operations could suffer.Governmental agencies throughout the world, including the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the European Aviation Safety Agency, prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components, including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although compliance with FAA requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries. We include documentation with our products sold to aircraft manufacturing customers certifying that each part complies with applicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. In order to sell our products, the Corporation as well as the products we manufacture must also be certified by our individual original equipment manufacturers (OEM) customers. If any of the material authorizations or approvals qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended, then the sale of such product would be prohibited by law, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.From time to time, the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations, which are usually more stringent than existing regulations. If these proposed regulations are adopted and enacted, we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop new technologies.Virtually all of the products produced and sold by us are highly engineered and require sophisticated manufacturing and system-integration techniques and capabilities. The commercial and government markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies. The product and program needs of our government and commercial customers change and evolve regularly. Accordingly, our future performance depends in part on our ability to: identify emerging technological trends in our current and target markets, develop and manufacture competitive products, systems, and services, enhance our offerings by adding technological innovations that differentiate our products, systems, and services from those of our competitors, and develop, manufacture, and bring those products, systems, and service to market quickly at cost-effective prices.We operate in highly competitive markets.Many of our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets and are affected by varying degrees of competition. We compete against companies that often have higher sales volumes and greater financial, technological, research and development, human, and marketing resources than we have. As a result, they may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns. In addition, some of our largest customers could develop the capability to manufacture products or provide services similar to products that we manufacture or services that we provide. This would result in these customers supplying their own products or services and competing directly with us for sales of these products or services, all of which could significantly reduce our revenues. Furthermore, we are facing increased international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition. Our management believes that the principal points of competition in our markets are technology, product quality, product performance, price, technical expertise, timeliness of delivery, superior customer service and support, and continued certification under customer quality requirements and assurance programs. If we are unable to compete successfully with existing or new competitors in these areas, we may experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.A downturn in the aircraft market could adversely affect our business.Our sales to large commercial aircraft manufacturers are cyclical in nature and can be adversely affected by a number of factors, including current and future passenger traffic levels, increasing fuel and labor costs, intense price competition, the retirement of older aircraft, regulatory changes, outbreak of infectious disease, terrorist attacks, general economic conditions, worldwide airline profits, and backlog levels, all of which can be unpredictable and are outside our control. Any decrease in demand resulting from a downturn in the aerospace market could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Global economic conditions may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.12Although we currently generate significant operating cash flows, which combined with access to the credit markets provides us with significant discretionary funding capacity, global macroeconomic uncertainty, including escalating trade disputes between the United States and China, the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, and uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets could affect our ability to fund our operations. In addition, certain of our customers and suppliers could be affected directly by an economic downturn and could face credit issues or cash flow problems that could give rise to payment delays, increased credit risk, bankruptcies, and other financial hardships, which could impact customer demand for our products as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers and suppliers. Depending on their severity and duration, the effects and consequences of a global economic downturn could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.Political and economic changes in foreign countries and markets, including foreign currency fluctuations, may have a material effect on our operating results.During 2019, approximately 31% of our total net sales were to customers outside of the United States. Additionally, we also have operating facilities located in foreign countries. Doing business in foreign countries is subject to numerous risks, including without limitation: political and economic instability, the uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases, restrictive trade policies, changes in the local labor-relations climate, economic conditions in local markets, health concerns, and complying with foreign regulatory and tax requirements that are subject to change. While these factors or the impact of these factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations. To the extent that foreign sales are transacted in foreign currencies and we do not enter into currency hedge transactions, we are exposed to risk of losses due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly for the British Pound, Euro, and Canadian dollar. Significant fluctuations in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Potential product liability risks exist from the products that we sell.We may be exposed to liabilities for personal injury, death, or property damage due to the failure of a product that we have sold. We typically agree to indemnify our customers against certain liabilities resulting from the products we sell, and any third-party indemnification we seek from our suppliers and our liability insurance may not fully cover our indemnification obligations to customers. We may also not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Any liability for which third-party indemnification is not available that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.In addition, an accident caused by one of our products could damage our reputation for selling quality products. We believe that our customers consider safety and reliability as key criteria in selecting our products and believe that our reputation for quality assurance is a significant competitive strength. If an accident were to be caused by one of our products, or if we were to otherwise fail to maintain a satisfactory record of safety and reliability, our ability to retain and attract customers may be materially adversely affected.We are subject to liability under warranty obligations.The majority of our contracts contain provisions which expose us to potential liability for warranty claims made by customers or third parties with respect to products that have been designed, manufactured, or serviced by us or our suppliers. Material product warranty obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, our reputation may be adversely affected by such defective product claims, whether or not successful, including potential negative publicity about our products.Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our cash flows and financial condition. Our business operates in many locations under government jurisdictions that impose income taxes. Changes in domestic or foreign income tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or lower income tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain revenues or the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability. In addition, the amount of income taxes paid by us is subject to examination by U.S. federal, state, and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from such examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of any such examinations. If the ultimate determination of our taxes owed were for an amount in excess of amounts reserved, our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.13If we fail to satisfy our contractual obligations, our contracts may be terminated and we may incur significant costs or liabilities, including liquidated damages and penalties.In general, our contracts may be terminated for our failure to satisfy our contractual obligations. In addition, some of our contracts contain substantial liquidated damages provisions and financial penalties related to our failure to satisfy our contractual obligations. For example, the terms of the Electro-Mechanical Division's AP1000 China and AP1000 U.S. contracts with Westinghouse Electric Company (WEC) include liquidated damage penalty provisions for failure to meet contractual delivery dates if we caused the delay and the delay was not excusable.  On October 10, 2013, we received a letter from WEC stating entitlements to the maximum amount of liquidated damages allowable under the AP1000 China contract of approximately $25 million.  To date, we have not met certain contractual delivery dates under the AP 1000 China and U.S. contracts; however there are significant uncertainties as to which parties are responsible for the delays, and we believe we have adequate legal defenses. Consequently, as a result of the above matters, we may incur significant costs or liabilities, including penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. As of December 31, 2019, the range of possible loss for liquidated damages on the WEC U.S. and China contracts is $0 to $55.5 million.We are subject to liability under environmental laws.Our business and facilities are subject to numerous federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to the use, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials and other waste products. Environmental laws generally impose liability for investigation, remediation, and removal of hazardous materials and other waste products on property owners and those who dispose of materials at waste sites, whether or not the waste was disposed of legally at the time in question. We are currently addressing environmental remediation at certain current and former facilities, and we have been named as a potentially responsible party along with other organizations in a number of environmental clean-up sites and may be named in connection with future sites. We are required to contribute to the costs of the investigation and remediation and to establish reserves in our financial statements for future costs deemed probable and estimable. Although we have estimated and reserved for future environmental remediation costs, the final resolution of these liabilities may significantly vary from our estimates and could potentially have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.We use estimates when accounting for long-term contracts. Changes in estimates could affect our profitability and overall financial position.Long-term contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. For example, assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract as costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials. Similarly, assumptions have to be made regarding the future impact of efficiency initiatives and cost reduction efforts. Incentives, awards, price escalations, liquidated damages, or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance. It is possible that materially different amounts could be obtained, because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, if different assumptions were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances, or estimates may have a material adverse effect upon future period financial reporting and performance. See “Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.Our backlog is subject to reduction and cancellation, which could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.Backlog represents products or services that our customers have contractually committed to purchase from us. Total backlog includes both funded (unfilled orders for which funding is authorized, appropriated, and contractually obligated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated and/or contractually obligated by the customer). We are a subcontractor to prime contractors for the vast majority of our government business; as such, substantially all amounts in backlog are funded. Backlog excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering type contracts (e.g. Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity). Backlog is adjusted for changes in foreign exchange rates and is reduced for contract cancellations and terminations in the period in which they occur. Backlog as of December 31, 2019 was $2.2 billion. Backlog is subject to fluctuations and is not necessarily indicative of future sales. The U.S. Government may unilaterally modify or cancel its contracts. In addition, under certain of our commercial contracts, our customers may unilaterally modify or terminate their orders at any time for their convenience. Accordingly, certain portions of our backlog can be cancelled or reduced at the option of the U.S. Government and commercial customers. Our failure to replace cancelled or reduced backlog could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.14We may be unable to protect the value of our intellectual property.Obtaining, maintaining, and enforcing our intellectual property rights and avoiding infringing on the intellectual property rights of others are important factors to the operation of our business. While we take precautionary steps to protect our technological advantages and intellectual property and rely in part on patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright laws, we cannot assure that the precautionary steps we have taken will completely protect our intellectual property rights. Because patent applications in the United States are maintained in secrecy until either the patent application is published or a patent is issued, we may not be aware of third-party patents, patent applications, and other intellectual property relevant to our products that may block our use of our intellectual property or may be used in third-party products that compete with our products and processes. When others infringe on our intellectual property rights, the value of our products is diminished, and we may incur substantial litigation costs to enforce our rights. Similarly, we may incur substantial litigation costs and the obligation to pay royalties if others claim we infringed on their intellectual property rights. When we develop intellectual property and technologies with funding from U.S. Government contracts, the government has the royalty-free right to use that property.In addition to our patent rights, we also rely on unpatented technology, trade secrets, and confidential information. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques or otherwise gain access to or disclose our technology. We may not be able to protect our rights in unpatented technology, trade secrets, and confidential information effectively. We generally require each of our employees and consultants to execute a confidentiality agreement at the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us. There is no guarantee that we will succeed in obtaining and retaining executed agreements from all employees or consultants. Moreover, these agreements may not provide effective protection of our information or, in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure, they may not provide adequate remedies.Our future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairment charges.As of December 31, 2019, we had goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of approximately $1,647 million, which represented approximately 44% of our total assets. Our goodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and is also tested whenever events and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. Intangible assets (other than goodwill) are generally amortized over the useful life of such assets. In addition, from time to time, we may acquire or make an investment in a business that will require us to record goodwill based on the purchase price and the value of the acquired assets. We may subsequently experience unforeseen issues with such business that adversely affect the anticipated returns of the business or value of the intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets for such business. Future determinations of significant write-offs of goodwill or intangible assets as a result of an impairment test or any accelerated amortization of other intangible assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.Our current debt, and debt we may incur in the future, could adversely affect our business and financial position.As of December 31, 2019, we had $761 million of debt outstanding. Our level of debt could have significant consequences for our business including: requiring us to use our cash flow to pay the principal and interest on our debt, reducing funds available for acquisitions and other investments in our business, making us vulnerable to economic downturns and increases in interest rates, limiting us from obtaining additional debt, and impacting our ability to pay dividends.A percentage of our workforce is employed under collective bargaining agreements.Approximately 7% of our workforce is employed under collective bargaining agreements, which from time to time are subject to renewal and negotiation. We cannot ensure that we will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements, that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor, or that a breakdown in such negotiations will not result in the disruption of our operations. Although we have generally enjoyed good relations with both our unionized and non-unionized employees, we may experience an adverse impact on our operating results if we are subject to labor actions.Our earnings and margins depend in part on subcontractor performance, as well as raw material and component availability and pricing.Our businesses depend on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials and components. At times subcontractors perform services that we provide to our customers. We depend on these subcontractors and vendors to meet their contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements. Nonperformance or underperformance by subcontractors and vendors could materially impact our ability to perform obligations to our customers, which could result in a customer terminating our contract for default, expose us to liability, and substantially impair our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. Generally, raw 15materials and purchased components are available from a number of different suppliers, though several suppliers are our sole source of certain components. If a sole-source supplier should cease or otherwise be unable to deliver such components, our operating results could be adversely impacted. In addition, our supply networks can sometimes experience price fluctuations. Our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor may be adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers are unable to provide the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner. While we have attempted to mitigate the effects of increased costs through price increases, there are no assurances that higher prices can effectively be passed through to our customers or that we will be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw materials costs through price increases on a timely basis.Our business involves risks associated with complex manufacturing processes.Our manufacturing processes depend on certain sophisticated and high-value equipment. Unexpected failures of this equipment may result in production delays, revenue loss, and significant repair costs. In addition, equipment failures could result in injuries to our employees. Moreover, the competitive nature of our businesses requires us to continuously implement process changes intended to achieve product improvements and manufacturing efficiencies. These process changes may at times result in production delays, quality concerns, and increased costs. Any disruption of operations at our facilities due to equipment failures or process interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business.We self-insure health benefits and may be adversely impacted by unfavorable claims experience.We are primarily self-insured for our health benefits. If the number or severity of claims increases, or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than our original assessment, our operating results would be adversely affected. Our future claims expense might exceed historical levels, which could reduce our earnings. We expect to periodically assess our self-insurance strategy. We are required to periodically evaluate and adjust our claims reserves to reflect our experience. However, ultimate results may differ from our estimates, which could result in losses over our reserved amounts. In addition, because we do not carry “stop loss” insurance, a significant increase in the number of claims that we must cover under our self-insurance retainage could adversely affect our profitability.Increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.Our earnings may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of income or expense we record for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. U.S. GAAP requires that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions relating to financial markets and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can change the assumptions. The most significant year-end assumptions used to estimate pension or other postretirement benefit expense for the following year are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, expected future medical cost inflation, and expected compensation increases. In addition, we are required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant change to equity through a reduction or increase to other comprehensive income. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement benefit plans accounting policies, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies—Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.  Although U.S. GAAP expense and pension or other postretirement contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect U.S. GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash we would contribute to the pension or other postretirement plans. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law, Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and discretionary contributions to improve the plans’ funded status. An obligation to make contributions to pension plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses.Future terror attacks, war, natural disasters, pandemic diseases, or other events beyond our control could adversely impact our businesses.Despite our concerted effort to minimize risk to our production capabilities and corporate information systems and to reduce the effect of unforeseen interruptions through business continuity planning and disaster recovery plans, we could be adversely impacted by terror attacks, war, natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, pandemic diseases, or other events such as strikes by the workforce of a significant customer or supplier. These risks could negatively impact demand for or supply of our products and could also cause disruption to our facilities or systems, which could also interrupt operational processes and adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products and provide services and support to our customers. We operate facilities in areas of the world that are exposed to natural disasters. Financial difficulties of our customers, delays by our customers in production of their products, high fuel prices, the concern of another major terrorist attack, and the overall decreased demand for our products could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.16Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by climate change regulations.Climate change regulations at the federal, state, or local level or in international jurisdictions could require us to limit emissions, change our manufacturing processes, obtain substitute materials which may cost more or be less available, increase our investment in control technology for greenhouse gas emissions, fund offset projects, or undertake other costly activities. These regulations could significantly increase our costs and restrict our manufacturing operations by virtue of requirements for new equipment. New permits may be required for our current operations, or expansions thereof. Failure to timely receive permits could result in fines, suspension of production, or cessation of operations at one or more facilities. In addition, restrictions on carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas emissions could result in significant costs such as higher energy costs and the passing down of carbon taxes, emission cap and trade programs, and renewable portfolio standards by utility companies. The cost of complying, or of failing to comply, with these and other climate change and emissions regulations could have an adverse effect on our operating results.Increasing focus on environmental, social, and governance responsibility may impose additional costs on us and expose us to new risks.Increasing focus on environmental, social, and governance responsibility may impose additional costs on us and expose us to new risks. Regulators, stockholders, and other interested constituencies have focused increasingly on the environmental, social, and governance practices of companies. Our customers may require us to implement environmental, social, or governance responsibility procedures or standards before they continue to do business with us. Additionally, we may face reputational challenges in the event that our environmental, social, or governance responsibility procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by certain constituencies. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations"
9,CW,CURTISS-WRIGHT CORP,2019-02-27,"Risk Factors
.We have summarized the known, material risks to our business below. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely impacted if any of these risks materialize. Additional risk factors not currently known to us or that we believe are immaterial may also impair our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows. The risk factors below should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as other required filings by us to the Securities Exchange Commission, such as our Form 10-Q’s, Form 8-K’s, proxy statements for our annual shareholder meetings, and subsequent amendments, if any.8Intrusion on our systems could damage our business.We store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, and confidential employee information on our servers and databases. Despite our implementation of firewalls, switchgear, and other network security measures, our servers, databases, and other systems may be vulnerable to computer hackers, physical or electronic break-ins, sabotage, computer viruses, worms, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. We continue to review and enhance our computer systems as well as provide training to our employees in an attempt to prevent unauthorized and unlawful intrusions, but in the future it is possible that we may not be able to prevent all intrusions. Such intrusions could result in our network security or computer systems being compromised and possibly result in the misappropriation or corruption of sensitive information or cause disruptions in our services. We might be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against, remediate, or alleviate problems caused by such intrusions. Any such intrusion could cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subject us to legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.A substantial portion of our revenues and earnings depends upon the continued willingness of the U.S. Government and other customers in the defense industry to buy our products and services.In 2018, approximately 34% of our total net sales were derived from or related to U.S. defense programs.  U.S. defense spending has historically been cyclical, and defense budgets tend to rise when perceived threats to national security increase the level of concern over the country’s safety. At other times, spending by the military can decrease. In August 2011, Congress enacted the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA), which imposed spending caps and certain reductions in defense spending over a ten-year period through 2021. These spending caps and reductions, referred to as sequestration, went into effect in March 2013. Through a series of bipartisan agreements, Congress has been able to temporarily lift discretionary spending limits every year through 2019. However, unless a new agreement is enacted, the BCA will again become effective beginning in 2020.  As a result of this uncertainty, a decrease in U.S. Government defense spending or changes in spending allocation could result in one or more of our programs being reduced, delayed, or terminated. In the event one or more of our programs are reduced, delayed, or terminated for which we provide products and services and are not offset by revenues from foreign sales, new programs, or products or services that we currently manufacture or provide, we may experience a reduction in our revenues and earnings and a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows.As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations.We must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business. A violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, the termination of our contracts, or debarment from bidding on contracts. These fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards, receiving or paying kickbacks, or filing false claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies. The failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation. It could also result in our progress payments being withheld. In some instances, these laws and regulations impose terms or rights that are more favorable to the government than those typically available to commercial parties in negotiated transactions. For example, the U.S. Government may terminate any of our government contracts and, in general, subcontracts, at its convenience as well as for default based on performance. Upon termination for convenience of a fixed-price type contract, we normally are entitled to receive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement for allowable costs for work-in-process, and an allowance for profit on work actually completed on the contract or adjustment for loss if completion of performance would have resulted in a loss. Upon termination for convenience of a cost reimbursement contract, we normally are entitled to reimbursement of allowable costs plus a portion of the fee. Such allowable costs would normally include our cost to terminate agreements with our suppliers and subcontractors. The amount of the fee recovered, if any, is related to the portion of the work accomplished prior to termination and is determined by negotiation.A termination arising out of our default could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. In addition, on those contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor, the U.S. Government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor, irrespective of the quality of our services as a subcontractor.Our U.S. Government contracts typically span one or more base years and multiple option years. The U.S. Government generally has the right to not exercise option periods and may not exercise an option period if the agency is not satisfied with 9our performance on the contract or does not receive funding to continue the program. U.S. Government procurement may adversely affect our cash flow or program profitability.Furthermore, we are subject to other risks in connection with government contracts, including without limitation:•the frequent need to bid on programs prior to completing the necessary design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and/or cost overruns;•the difficulty in forecasting long-term costs and schedules and the potential obsolescence of products related to long-term, fixed price contracts;•contracts with varying fixed terms that may not be renewed or followed by follow-on contracts upon expiration;•cancellation of the follow-on production phase of contracts if program requirements are not met in the development phase; and•the fact that government contract wins can be contested by other contractors.Our operations are subject to numerous domestic and international laws, regulations, and restrictions. Noncompliance with these laws, regulations, and restrictions could expose us to fines, penalties, suspension, or debarment, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and overall financial condition.We have contracts and operations in many parts of the world subject to United States and foreign laws and regulations, including the False Claims Act, regulations relating to import-export control (including the International Traffic in Arms Regulation promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act), technology transfer restrictions, repatriation of earnings, exchange controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act, and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act.  Although we have implemented policies and procedures and provided training that we believe are sufficient to address these risks, we cannot guarantee that our operations will always comply with these laws and regulations. From time to time, we may file voluntary disclosure reports with the U.S. Department of State, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Commerce regarding certain violations of U.S. export control laws and regulations discovered by us in the course of our business activities, employee training, or internal reviews and audits. To date, our voluntary disclosures have not resulted in a fine, penalty, or export privilege denial or restriction that has had a material adverse impact on our financial condition or ability to export. Our failure, or failure by our sales representatives or consultants to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities and could, in the extreme case, result in suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if the United States were to withdraw from or materially modify certain international trade agreements, or if tariffs or other restrictions on the foreign-sourced goods that we sell were to increase.A significant portion of our business activities are conducted in foreign countries, including Mexico and Canada. Our business benefits from free trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and we also rely on various U.S. corporate tax provisions related to international commerce as we build, market, and sell our products globally. On November 30, 2018, President Trump signed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) to replace NAFTA. The USMCA maintains duty-free access for most products and leaves most key provisions of the NAFTA agreement largely intact. The USMCA still requires approval by the U.S. Congress, Mexico’s National Assembly, and Canada’s Parliament before it enters into force.  Additionally, President Trump recently announced his intention for the United States to withdraw from NAFTA.  The outcome of the Congressional approval process is uncertain, but it is possible that withdrawal or revisions to NATFA or failure to secure Congressional approval of the USMCA could cause an increase in customs duties which in turn could adversely affect intercompany transactions among our operating subsidiaries in Canada, Mexico, and the U.S., as well as increase transaction costs with third party suppliers and customers. Furthermore, the current administration has threatened tougher trade terms with China and other countries, leading to the imposition of substantially higher U.S. tariffs on $250 billion of imports from China as well as higher Chinese tariffs on a large amount of U.S. exports to China. All of this could lead to increased costs and diminished sales opportunities in the U.S. and Chinese markets. Media and political reactions in the affected countries could potentially exacerbate the impact on our operations in those countries. The U.S. Administration’s assertive trade policies could result in further conflicts with U.S. trading partners, affecting our supply chains, sourcing, and markets. Foreign countries may impose additional burdens on us through the use of local regulations, tariffs or other requirements, which could increase our operating costs in those foreign jurisdictions. At this time, it remains unclear what actions, if any, President Trump will take with respect to other international trade agreements and U.S. tax provisions related to international commerce. If Congress does not pass the USMCA and if the United States were to withdraw from or materially modify NAFTA or other international trade agreements to which it is a party, or change corporate tax policy related to international commerce, or if tariffs were raised on the foreign-sourced goods that we sell, such goods may no longer be 10available at a commercially attractive price or at all. This in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability. Our business operates in many locations under government jurisdictions that impose income taxes. Changes in domestic or foreign income tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or lower income tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain revenues or the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability. In addition, the amount of income taxes paid by us is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state, and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Global economic conditions may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.Although we currently generate significant operating cash flows, which combined with access to the credit markets provides us with significant discretionary funding capacity, global economic and financial disruptions and tightening of the credit markets could affect our ability to fund our operations. In addition, certain of our customers and suppliers could be affected directly by an economic downturn and could face credit issues or cash flow problems that could give rise to payment delays, increased credit risk, bankruptcies, and other financial hardships, which could impact customer demand for our products as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers and suppliers. Depending on their severity and duration, the effects and consequences of a global economic downturn could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.Political and economic changes in foreign countries and markets, including foreign currency fluctuations, may have a material effect on our operating results.During 2018, approximately 33% of our total net sales were to customers outside of the United States. Additionally, we also have operating facilities located in foreign countries. Doing business in foreign countries is subject to numerous risks, including without limitation: political and economic instability, the uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases, restrictive trade policies, changes in the local labor-relations climate, economic conditions in local markets, health concerns, and complying with foreign regulatory and tax requirements that are subject to change. While these factors or the impact of these factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations. To the extent that foreign sales are transacted in foreign currencies and we do not enter into currency hedge transactions, we are exposed to risk of losses due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly for the British Pound, Euro, and Canadian dollar. Significant fluctuations in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.We operate in highly competitive markets.Many of our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets and are affected by varying degrees of competition. We compete against companies that often have higher sales volumes and greater financial, technological, research and development, human, and marketing resources than we have. As a result, they may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns. In addition, some of our largest customers could develop the capability to manufacture products or provide services similar to products that we manufacture or services that we provide. This would result in these customers supplying their own products or services and competing directly with us for sales of these products or services, all of which could significantly reduce our revenues. Furthermore, we are facing increased international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition. Our management believes that the principal points of competition in our markets are technology, product quality, product performance, price, technical expertise, timeliness of delivery, superior customer service and support, and continued certification under customer quality requirements and assurance programs. If we are unable to compete successfully with existing or new competitors in these areas, we may experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Potential product liability risks exist from the products that we sell.We may be exposed to liabilities for personal injury, death, or property damage due to the failure of a product that we have sold. We typically agree to indemnify our customers against certain liabilities resulting from the products we sell, and any third-party indemnification we seek from our suppliers and our liability insurance may not fully cover our indemnification obligations to customers. We may also not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Any 11liability for which third-party indemnification is not available that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.In addition, an accident caused by one of our products could damage our reputation for selling quality products. We believe that our customers consider safety and reliability as key criteria in selecting our products and believe that our reputation for quality assurance is a significant competitive strength. If an accident were to be caused by one of our products, or if we were to otherwise fail to maintain a satisfactory record of safety and reliability, our ability to retain and attract customers may be materially adversely affected.We are subject to liability under warranty obligations.The majority of our contracts contain provisions which expose us to potential liability for warranty claims made by customers or third parties with respect to products that have been designed, manufactured, or serviced by us or our suppliers. Material product warranty obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, our reputation may be adversely affected by such defective product claims, whether or not successful, including potential negative publicity about our products.A downturn in the aircraft market could adversely affect our business.Our sales to large commercial aircraft manufacturers are cyclical in nature and can be adversely affected by a number of factors, including current and future traffic levels, increasing fuel and labor costs, intense price competition, the retirement of older aircraft, regulatory changes, outbreak of infectious disease, terrorist attacks, general economic conditions, worldwide airline profits, and backlog levels, all of which can be unpredictable and are outside our control. Any decrease in demand resulting from a downturn in the aerospace market could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.The airline industry is heavily regulated, and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements, our results of operations could suffer.Governmental agencies throughout the world, including the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the European Aviation Safety Agency, prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components, including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although compliance with FAA requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries. We include documentation with our products sold to aircraft manufacturing customers certifying that each part complies with applicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. In order to sell our products, the Corporation as well as the products we manufacture must also be certified by our individual original equipment manufacturers (OEM) customers. If any of the material authorizations or approvals qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended, then the sale of such product would be prohibited by law, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.From time to time, the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations, which are usually more stringent than existing regulations. If these proposed regulations are adopted and enacted, we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.If we fail to satisfy our contractual obligations, our contracts may be terminated and we may incur significant costs or liabilities, including liquidated damages and penalties.In general, our contracts may be terminated for our failure to satisfy our contractual obligations. In addition, some of our contracts contain substantial liquidated damages provisions and financial penalties related to our failure to satisfy our contractual obligations. For example, the terms of the Electro-Mechanical Division's AP1000 China and AP1000 U.S. contracts with Westinghouse Electric Company (WEC) include liquidated damage penalty provisions for failure to meet contractual delivery dates if we caused the delay and the delay was not excusable.  On October 10, 2013, we received a letter from WEC stating entitlements to the maximum amount of liquidated damages allowable under the AP1000 China contract of approximately $25 million.  To date, we have not met certain contractual delivery dates under the AP 1000 China and U.S. contracts; however there are significant uncertainties as to which parties are responsible for the delays, and we believe we have adequate legal defenses. Consequently, as a result of the above matters, we may incur significant costs or liabilities, including penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. As of 12December 31, 2018, the range of possible loss for liquidated damages on the WEC U.S. and China contracts is $0 to $55.5 million.We are subject to liability under environmental laws.Our business and facilities are subject to numerous federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to the use, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials and other waste products. Environmental laws generally impose liability for investigation, remediation, and removal of hazardous materials and other waste products on property owners and those who dispose of materials at waste sites, whether or not the waste was disposed of legally at the time in question. We are currently addressing environmental remediation at certain current and former facilities, and we have been named as a potentially responsible party along with other organizations in a number of environmental clean-up sites and may be named in connection with future sites. We are required to contribute to the costs of the investigation and remediation and to establish reserves in our financial statements for future costs deemed probable and estimable. Although we have estimated and reserved for future environmental remediation costs, the final resolution of these liabilities may significantly vary from our estimates and could potentially have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.Our future growth and continued success is dependent upon our key personnel.Our success is dependent upon the efforts of our senior management personnel and our ability to attract and retain other highly qualified management and technical personnel. We face competition for management and qualified technical personnel from other companies and organizations. Therefore, we may not be able to retain our existing management and technical personnel or fill new management or technical positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover at our existing compensation levels. Although we have entered into change of control agreements with some members of senior management, we do not have employment contracts with our key executives. As some of our key executives approach retirement age, we have made a concerted effort to reduce the effect of the loss of our senior management personnel through management succession planning. However, we may be required to devote significant time and resources to identify and integrate key new personnel should key management losses occur earlier than anticipated. The loss of members of our senior management and qualified technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.We use estimates when accounting for long-term contracts. Changes in estimates could affect our profitability and overall financial position.Long-term contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. For example, assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract as costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials. Similarly, assumptions have to be made regarding the future impact of efficiency initiatives and cost reduction efforts. Incentives, awards, price escalations, liquidated damages, or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance. It is possible that materially different amounts could be obtained, because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, if different assumptions were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances, or estimates may have a material adverse effect upon future period financial reporting and performance. See “Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.Our backlog is subject to reduction and cancellation, which could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.Backlog represents products or services that our customers have contractually committed to purchase from us. Total backlog includes both funded (unfilled orders for which funding is authorized, appropriated, and contractually obligated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated and/or contractually obligated by the customer). We are a subcontractor to prime contractors for the vast majority of our government business; as such, substantially all amounts in backlog are funded. Backlog excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering type contracts (e.g. Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity). Backlog is adjusted for changes in foreign exchange rates and is reduced for contract cancellations and terminations in the period in which they occur. Backlog as of December 31, 2018 was $2.0 billion. Backlog is subject to fluctuations and is not necessarily indicative of future sales. The U.S. Government may unilaterally modify or cancel its contracts. In addition, under certain of our commercial contracts, our customers may unilaterally modify or terminate their orders at any time for their convenience. Accordingly, certain portions of our backlog can be cancelled or reduced at the option of the U.S. Government and commercial customers. Our failure to replace cancelled or reduced backlog could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.13We may be unable to protect the value of our intellectual property.Obtaining, maintaining, and enforcing our intellectual property rights and avoiding infringing on the intellectual property rights of others are important factors to the operation of our business. While we take precautionary steps to protect our technological advantages and intellectual property and rely in part on patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright laws, we cannot assure that the precautionary steps we have taken will completely protect our intellectual property rights. Because patent applications in the United States are maintained in secrecy until either the patent application is published or a patent is issued, we may not be aware of third-party patents, patent applications, and other intellectual property relevant to our products that may block our use of our intellectual property or may be used in third-party products that compete with our products and processes. When others infringe on our intellectual property rights, the value of our products is diminished, and we may incur substantial litigation costs to enforce our rights. Similarly, we may incur substantial litigation costs and the obligation to pay royalties if others claim we infringed on their intellectual property rights. When we develop intellectual property and technologies with funding from U.S. Government contracts, the government has the royalty-free right to use that property.In addition to our patent rights, we also rely on unpatented technology, trade secrets, and confidential information. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques or otherwise gain access to or disclose our technology. We may not be able to protect our rights in unpatented technology, trade secrets, and confidential information effectively. We require each of our employees and consultants to execute a confidentiality agreement at the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us. There is no guarantee that we will succeed in obtaining and retaining executed agreements from all employees or consultants. Moreover, these agreements may not provide effective protection of our information or, in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure, they may not provide adequate remedies.Our future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairment charges.As of December 31, 2018, we had goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of approximately $1,518 million, which represented approximately 47% of our total assets. Our goodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and is also tested whenever events and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. Intangible assets (other than goodwill) are generally amortized over the useful life of such assets. In addition, from time to time, we may acquire or make an investment in a business that will require us to record goodwill based on the purchase price and the value of the acquired assets. We may subsequently experience unforeseen issues with such business that adversely affect the anticipated returns of the business or value of the intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets for such business. Future determinations of significant write-offs of goodwill or intangible assets as a result of an impairment test or any accelerated amortization of other intangible assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.Our current debt, and debt we may incur in the future, could adversely affect our business and financial position.As of December 31, 2018, we had $763 million of debt outstanding. Our level of debt could have significant consequences for our business including: requiring us to use our cash flow to pay the principal and interest on our debt, reducing funds available for acquisitions and other investments in our business, making us vulnerable to economic downturns and increases in interest rates, limiting us from obtaining additional debt, and impacting our ability to pay dividends.A percentage of our workforce is employed under collective bargaining agreements.Approximately 7% of our workforce is employed under collective bargaining agreements, which from time to time are subject to renewal and negotiation. We cannot ensure that we will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements, that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor, or that a breakdown in such negotiations will not result in the disruption of our operations. Although we have generally enjoyed good relations with both our unionized and non-unionized employees, we may experience an adverse impact on our operating results if we are subject to labor actions.Our earnings and margins depend in part on subcontractor performance, as well as raw material and component availability and pricing.Our businesses depend on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials and components. At times subcontractors perform services that we provide to our customers. We depend on these subcontractors and vendors to meet their contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements. Nonperformance or underperformance by subcontractors and vendors could materially impact our ability to perform obligations to our customers, which could result in a customer terminating our contract for default, expose us to liability, and substantially impair our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. Generally, raw materials and purchased components are available from a number of different suppliers, though several suppliers are our sole 14source of certain components. If a sole-source supplier should cease or otherwise be unable to deliver such components, our operating results could be adversely impacted. In addition, our supply networks can sometimes experience price fluctuations. Our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor may be adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers are unable to provide the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner. While we have attempted to mitigate the effects of increased costs through price increases, there are no assurances that higher prices can effectively be passed through to our customers or that we will be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw materials costs through price increases on a timely basis.Our business involves risks associated with complex manufacturing processes.Our manufacturing processes depend on certain sophisticated and high-value equipment. Unexpected failures of this equipment may result in production delays, revenue loss, and significant repair costs. In addition, equipment failures could result in injuries to our employees. Moreover, the competitive nature of our businesses requires us to continuously implement process changes intended to achieve product improvements and manufacturing efficiencies. These process changes may at times result in production delays, quality concerns, and increased costs. Any disruption of operations at our facilities due to equipment failures or process interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop new technologies.Virtually all of the products produced and sold by us are highly engineered and require sophisticated manufacturing and system-integration techniques and capabilities. The commercial and government markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies. The product and program needs of our government and commercial customers change and evolve regularly. Accordingly, our future performance depends in part on our ability to: identify emerging technological trends in our current and target markets, develop and manufacture competitive products, systems, and services, enhance our offerings by adding technological innovations that differentiate our products, systems, and services from those of our competitors, and develop, manufacture, and bring those products, systems, and service to market quickly at cost-effective prices.We self-insure health benefits and may be adversely impacted by unfavorable claims experience.We are self-insured for our health benefits. If the number or severity of claims increases, or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than our original assessment, our operating results would be adversely affected. Our future claims expense might exceed historical levels, which could reduce our earnings. We expect to periodically assess our self-insurance strategy. We are required to periodically evaluate and adjust our claims reserves to reflect our experience. However, ultimate results may differ from our estimates, which could result in losses over our reserved amounts. In addition, because we do not carry “stop loss” insurance, a significant increase in the number of claims that we must cover under our self-insurance retainage could adversely affect our profitability.Increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.Our earnings may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of income or expense we record for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. U.S. GAAP requires that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions relating to financial markets and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can change the assumptions. The most significant year-end assumptions used to estimate pension or other postretirement benefit expense for the following year are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, expected future medical cost inflation, and expected compensation increases. In addition, we are required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant change to equity through a reduction or increase to other comprehensive income. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement benefit plans accounting policies, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies—Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.  Although U.S. GAAP expense and pension or other postretirement contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect U.S. GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash we would contribute to the pension or other postretirement plans. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law, Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and discretionary contributions to improve the plans’ funded status. An obligation to make contributions to pension plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses.Implementing our acquisition strategy involves risks, and our failure to successfully implement this strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business.15As part of our capital allocation strategy, we aim to grow our business by selectively pursuing acquisitions to supplement our organic growth.  We are continuing to actively pursue additional acquisition opportunities, some of which may be material to our business and financial performance.  Although we have been successful with this strategy in the past, we may not be able to grow our business in the future through acquisitions for a number of reasons, including:•Encountering difficulties identifying and executing acquisitions; •Increased competition for targets, which may increase acquisition costs; •Consolidation in our industry, reducing the number of acquisition targets; •Competition laws and regulations preventing us from making certain acquisitions; and •Acquisition financing not being available on acceptable terms or at all.In addition, there are potential risks associated with growing our business through acquisitions, including the failure to successfully integrate and realize the expected benefits of an acquisition.  For example, with any past or future acquisition, there is the possibility that:•The business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture; •Technological and product synergies, economies of scale, or cost reductions may not occur as expected; •Management may be distracted from overseeing existing operations by the need to integrate acquired businesses; •We may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities; •We may experience unforeseen difficulties in integrating operations and systems;•We may fail to retain or assimilate employees of the acquired business;•We may experience problems in retaining customers or integrating customer bases; and•We may encounter difficulties in entering new markets in which we may have little or no experience.Failure to successfully implement our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Future terror attacks, war, natural disasters, or other events beyond our control could adversely impact our businesses.Despite our concerted effort to minimize risk to our production capabilities and corporate information systems and to reduce the effect of unforeseen interruptions through business continuity planning and disaster recovery plans, we could be adversely impacted by terror attacks, war, natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, pandemic diseases, or other events such as strikes by the workforce of a significant customer or supplier. These risks could negatively impact demand for or supply of our products and could also cause disruption to our facilities or systems, which could also interrupt operational processes and adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products and provide services and support to our customers. We operate facilities in areas of the world that are exposed to natural disasters. Financial difficulties of our customers, delays by our customers in production of their products, high fuel prices, the concern of another major terrorist attack, and the overall decreased demand for our products could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition"
5,CW,CURTISS-WRIGHT CORP,2018-02-22,"Risk Factors
.8We have summarized the known, material risks to our business below. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely impacted if any of these risks materialize. Additional risk factors not currently known to us or that we believe are immaterial may also impair our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows. The risk factors below should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as other required filings by us to the Securities Exchange Commission, such as our Form 10-Q’s, Form 8-K’s, proxy statements for our annual shareholder meetings, and subsequent amendments, if any.Intrusion on our systems could damage our business.We store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, and confidential employee information on our servers and databases. Despite our implementation of firewalls, switchgear, and other network security measures, our servers, databases, and other systems may be vulnerable to computer hackers, physical or electronic break-ins, sabotage, computer viruses, worms, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. We continue to review and enhance our computer systems to try to prevent unauthorized and unlawful intrusions, but in the future it is possible that we may not be able to prevent all intrusions. Such intrusions could result in our network security or computer systems being compromised and possibly result in the misappropriation or corruption of sensitive information or cause disruptions in our services. We might be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against, remediate, or alleviate problems caused by such intrusions. Any such intrusion could cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subject us to legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.A substantial portion of our revenues and earnings depends upon the continued willingness of the U.S. Government and other customers in the defense industry to buy our products and services.In 2017, approximately 33% of our total net sales were derived from or related to U.S. defense programs.  U.S. defense spending has historically been cyclical, and defense budgets tend to rise when perceived threats to national security increase the level of concern over the country’s safety. At other times, spending by the military can decrease. In August 2011, Congress enacted the Budget Control Act of 2011, which imposed spending caps and certain reductions in defense spending over a ten-year period through 2021. These spending caps and reductions, referred to as sequestration, went into effect in March 2013. Through a series of bipartisan agreements, Congress has been able to temporarily lift discretionary spending limits every year through 2017. However, future budgets beyond 2017 are uncertain with respect to overall levels of defense spending. In addition, competing demands for federal funds can put pressure on all areas of discretionary spending, which could ultimately impact the defense budget. As a result of this uncertainty, a decrease in U.S. Government defense spending or changes in spending allocation could result in one or more of our programs being reduced, delayed, or terminated. In the event one or more of our programs are reduced, delayed, or terminated for which we provide products and services and are not offset by revenues from foreign sales, new programs, or products or services that we currently manufacture or provide, we may experience a reduction in our revenues and earnings and a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows. As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations.We must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business. A violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, the termination of our contracts, or debarment from bidding on contracts. These fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards, receiving or paying kickbacks, or filing false claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies. The failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation. It could also result in our progress payments being withheld. In some instances, these laws and regulations impose terms or rights that are more favorable to the government than those typically available to commercial parties in negotiated transactions. For example, the U.S. Government may terminate any of our government contracts and, in general, subcontracts, at its convenience as well as for default based on performance. Upon termination for convenience of a fixed-price type contract, we normally are entitled to receive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement for allowable costs for work-in-process, and an allowance for profit on work actually completed on the contract or adjustment for loss if completion of performance would have resulted in a loss. Upon termination for convenience of a cost reimbursement contract, we normally are entitled to reimbursement of allowable costs plus a portion of the fee. Such allowable costs would normally include our cost to terminate agreements with our suppliers and subcontractors. The amount of the fee recovered, if any, is related to the portion of the work accomplished prior to termination and is determined by negotiation.9A termination arising out of our default could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. In addition, on those contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor, the U.S. Government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor, irrespective of the quality of our services as a subcontractor.Our U.S. Government contracts typically span one or more base years and multiple option years. The U.S. Government generally has the right to not exercise option periods and may not exercise an option period if the agency is not satisfied with our performance on the contract or does not receive funding to continue the program. U.S. Government procurement may adversely affect our cash flow or program profitability.Furthermore, we are subject to other risks in connection with government contracts, including without limitation:•the frequent need to bid on programs prior to completing the necessary design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and/or cost overruns;•the difficulty in forecasting long-term costs and schedules and the potential obsolescence of products related to long-term, fixed price contracts;•contracts with varying fixed terms that may not be renewed or followed by follow-on contracts upon expiration;•cancellation of the follow-on production phase of contracts if program requirements are not met in the development phase; and•the fact that government contract wins can be contested by other contractors.Our operations are subject to numerous domestic and international laws, regulations, and restrictions. Noncompliance with these laws, regulations, and restrictions could expose us to fines, penalties, suspension, or debarment, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and overall financial condition.We have contracts and operations in many parts of the world subject to United States and foreign laws and regulations, including the False Claims Act, regulations relating to import-export control (including the International Traffic in Arms Regulation promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act), technology transfer restrictions, repatriation of earnings, exchange controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act, and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act.  Although we have implemented policies and procedures and provided training that we believe are sufficient to address these risks, we cannot guarantee that our operations will always comply with these laws and regulations. From time to time, we may file voluntary disclosure reports with the U.S. Department of State, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Commerce regarding certain violations of U.S. export control laws and regulations discovered by us in the course of our business activities, employee training, or internal reviews and audits. To date, our voluntary disclosures have not resulted in a fine, penalty, or export privilege denial or restriction that has had a material adverse impact on our financial condition or ability to export. Our failure, or failure by our sales representatives or consultants to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities and could, in the extreme case, result in suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if the United States were to withdraw from or materially modify NAFTA or certain other international trade agreements, or if tariffs or other restrictions on the foreign-sourced goods that we sell were to increase.A significant portion of our business activities are conducted in foreign countries, including Mexico and Canada. Our business benefits from free trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and we also rely on various U.S. corporate tax provisions related to international commerce as we build, market, and sell our products globally. U.S. international trade policy is uncertain under the Trump administration, including, for example, the government’s decision to renegotiate the NAFTA. This could cause an increase in customs duties which in turn could adversely affect intercompany transactions among our operating subsidiaries in Canada, Mexico, and the U.S., and increase transaction costs with third party suppliers and customers. In addition, President Trump has made comments suggesting that he supports significantly increasing tariffs on goods imported into the United States from certain countries such as Mexico. At this time, it remains unclear what actions, if any, President Trump will take with respect to other international trade agreements, U.S. tax provisions related to international commerce, and tariffs on goods imported into the United States. If the United States were to withdraw from or materially modify NAFTA or other international trade agreements to which it is a party, or change corporate tax policy related to international commerce, or if tariffs were raised on the foreign-sourced goods that we sell, such goods may no longer be available at a commercially attractive price or at all. This in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.10Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability. Our business operates in many locations under government jurisdictions that impose income taxes. Changes in domestic or foreign income tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or lower income tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain revenues or the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability. In addition, audits by income tax authorities could result in unanticipated increases in our income tax expense.Our operating results and financial condition may be adversely impacted by the current worldwide economic conditions.We currently generate significant operating cash flows, which combined with access to the credit markets provides us with significant discretionary funding capacity. However, financial markets in the United States, Europe, and Asia had experienced extreme disruption in previous years, which included, among other things, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments, and declining valuations of others. While these conditions had not previously impaired our ability to operate our business, there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets and confidence in major economies, which could impact customer demand for our products as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers, and creditors. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of a disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions and the effects they will have on our business and financial condition.Political and economic changes in foreign countries and markets, including foreign currency fluctuations, may have a material effect on our operating results.During 2017, approximately 31% of our total net sales were to customers outside of the United States. Additionally, we also have operating facilities located in foreign countries. Doing business in foreign countries is subject to numerous risks, including without limitation: political and economic instability, the uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases, restrictive trade policies, changes in the local labor-relations climate, economic conditions in local markets, health concerns, and complying with foreign regulatory and tax requirements that are subject to change. While these factors or the impact of these factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations. To the extent that foreign sales are transacted in foreign currencies and we do not enter into currency hedge transactions, we are exposed to risk of losses due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly for the British Pound, Euro, and Canadian dollar. Significant fluctuations in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.We operate in highly competitive markets.Many of our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets and are affected by varying degrees of competition. We compete against companies that often have higher sales volumes and greater financial, technological, research and development, human, and marketing resources than we have. As a result, they may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns. In addition, some of our largest customers could develop the capability to manufacture products or provide services similar to products that we manufacture or services that we provide. This would result in these customers supplying their own products or services and competing directly with us for sales of these products or services, all of which could significantly reduce our revenues. Furthermore, we are facing increased international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition. Our management believes that the principal points of competition in our markets are technology, product quality, product performance, price, technical expertise, timeliness of delivery, superior customer service and support, and continued certification under customer quality requirements and assurance programs. If we are unable to compete successfully with existing or new competitors in these areas, we may experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Potential product liability risks exist from the products that we sell.We may be exposed to liabilities for personal injury, death, or property damage due to the failure of a product that we have sold. We typically agree to indemnify our customers against certain liabilities resulting from the products we sell, and any third-party indemnification we seek from our suppliers and our liability insurance may not fully cover our indemnification obligations to customers. We may also not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Any liability for which third-party indemnification is not available that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.11In addition, an accident caused by one of our products could damage our reputation for selling quality products. We believe that our customers consider safety and reliability as key criteria in selecting our products and believe that our reputation for quality assurance is a significant competitive strength. If an accident were to be caused by one of our products, or if we were to otherwise fail to maintain a satisfactory record of safety and reliability, our ability to retain and attract customers may be materially adversely affected.A downturn in the aircraft market could adversely affect our business.Our sales to large commercial aircraft manufacturers are cyclical in nature and can be adversely affected by a number of factors, including current and future traffic levels, increasing fuel and labor costs, intense price competition, the retirement of older aircraft, regulatory changes, outbreak of infectious disease, terrorist attacks, general economic conditions, worldwide airline profits, and backlog levels, all of which can be unpredictable and are outside our control. Any decrease in demand resulting from a downturn in the aerospace market could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.If we fail to satisfy our contractual obligations, our contracts may be terminated and we may incur significant costs or liabilities, including liquidated damages and penalties.In general, our contracts may be terminated for our failure to satisfy our contractual obligations. In addition, some of our contracts contain substantial liquidated damages provisions and financial penalties related to our failure to satisfy our contractual obligations. For example, the terms of the Electro-Mechanical Division's AP1000 China and AP1000 U.S. contracts with Westinghouse Electric Company (WEC) include liquidated damage penalty provisions for failure to meet contractual delivery dates if we caused the delay and the delay was not excusable.  On October 10, 2013, we received a letter from WEC stating entitlements to the maximum amount of liquidated damages allowable under the AP1000 China contract of approximately $25 million.  To date, we have not met certain contractual delivery dates under the AP 1000 China and U.S. contracts; however there are significant uncertainties as to which parties are responsible for the delays, and we believe we have adequate legal defenses. Consequently, as a result of the above matters, we may incur significant costs or liabilities, including penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. As of December 31, 2017, the range of possible loss for liquidated damages on the WEC U.S. and China contracts is $0 to $55.5 million.We are subject to liability under environmental laws.Our business and facilities are subject to numerous federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to the use, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials and other waste products. Environmental laws generally impose liability for investigation, remediation, and removal of hazardous materials and other waste products on property owners and those who dispose of materials at waste sites, whether or not the waste was disposed of legally at the time in question. We are currently addressing environmental remediation at certain current and former facilities, and we have been named as a potentially responsible party along with other organizations in a number of environmental clean-up sites and may be named in connection with future sites. We are required to contribute to the costs of the investigation and remediation and to establish reserves in our financial statements for future costs deemed probable and estimable. Although we have estimated and reserved for future environmental remediation costs, the final resolution of these liabilities may significantly vary from our estimates and could potentially have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.Our future growth and continued success is dependent upon our key personnel.Our success is dependent upon the efforts of our senior management personnel and our ability to attract and retain other highly qualified management and technical personnel. We face competition for management and qualified technical personnel from other companies and organizations. Therefore, we may not be able to retain our existing management and technical personnel or fill new management or technical positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover at our existing compensation levels. Although we have entered into change of control agreements with some members of senior management, we do not have employment contracts with our key executives. We have made a concerted effort to reduce the effect of the loss of our senior management personnel through management succession planning. The loss of members of our senior management and qualified technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.We use estimates when accounting for long-term contracts. Changes in estimates could affect our profitability and overall financial position.12Long-term contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. For example, assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract as costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials. Similarly, assumptions have to be made regarding the future impact of efficiency initiatives and cost reduction efforts. Incentives, awards, price escalations, liquidated damages, or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance. It is possible that materially different amounts could be obtained, because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, if different assumptions were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances, or estimates may have a material adverse effect upon future period financial reporting and performance. See “Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.Our backlog is subject to reduction and cancellation, which could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.Backlog represents products or services that our customers have contractually committed to purchase from us. Total backlog includes both funded (unfilled orders for which funding is authorized, appropriated, and contractually obligated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated and/or contractually obligated by the customer). We are a subcontractor to prime contractors for the vast majority of our government business; as such, substantially all amounts in backlog are funded. Backlog excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering type contracts (e.g. Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity). Backlog is adjusted for changes in foreign exchange rates and is reduced for contract cancellations and terminations in the period in which they occur. Backlog as of December 31, 2017 was $2.0 billion. Backlog is subject to fluctuations and is not necessarily indicative of future sales. The U.S. Government may unilaterally modify or cancel its contracts. In addition, under certain of our commercial contracts, our customers may unilaterally modify or terminate their orders at any time for their convenience. Accordingly, certain portions of our backlog can be cancelled or reduced at the option of the U.S. Government and commercial customers. Our failure to replace cancelled or reduced backlog could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.We may be unable to protect the value of our intellectual property.Obtaining, maintaining, and enforcing our intellectual property rights and avoiding infringing on the intellectual property rights of others are important factors to the operation of our business. While we take precautionary steps to protect our technological advantages and intellectual property and rely in part on patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright laws, we cannot assure that the precautionary steps we have taken will completely protect our intellectual property rights. Because patent applications in the United States are maintained in secrecy until either the patent application is published or a patent is issued, we may not be aware of third-party patents, patent applications, and other intellectual property relevant to our products that may block our use of our intellectual property or may be used in third-party products that compete with our products and processes. When others infringe on our intellectual property rights, the value of our products is diminished, and we may incur substantial litigation costs to enforce our rights. Similarly, we may incur substantial litigation costs and the obligation to pay royalties if others claim we infringed on their intellectual property rights. When we develop intellectual property and technologies with funding from U.S. Government contracts, the government has the royalty-free right to use that property.In addition to our patent rights, we also rely on unpatented technology, trade secrets, and confidential information. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques or otherwise gain access to or disclose our technology. We may not be able to protect our rights in unpatented technology, trade secrets, and confidential information effectively. We require each of our employees and consultants to execute a confidentiality agreement at the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us. There is no guarantee that we will succeed in obtaining and retaining executed agreements from all employees or consultants. Moreover, these agreements may not provide effective protection of our information or, in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure, they may not provide adequate remedies.Our future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairment charges.As of December 31, 2017, we had goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of approximately $1,426 million, which represented approximately 44% of our total assets. Our goodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and is also tested whenever events and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. Intangible assets (other than goodwill) are generally amortized over the useful life of such assets. In addition, from time to time, we may acquire or make an investment in a business that will require us to record goodwill based on the purchase price and the value of the acquired assets. We may subsequently experience unforeseen issues with such business that adversely affect the anticipated returns of the business or value of the intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets for such business. Future determinations of significant write-offs of goodwill or intangible assets as a 13result of an impairment test or any accelerated amortization of other intangible assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.Our current debt, and debt we may incur in the future, could adversely affect our business and financial position.As of December 31, 2017, we had $814 million of debt outstanding. Our level of debt could have significant consequences for our business including: requiring us to use our cash flow to pay the principal and interest on our debt, reducing funds available for acquisitions and other investments in our business, making us vulnerable to economic downturns and increases in interest rates, limiting us from obtaining additional debt, and impacting our ability to pay dividends.A percentage of our workforce is employed under collective bargaining agreements.Approximately 8% of our workforce is employed under collective bargaining agreements, which from time to time are subject to renewal and negotiation. We cannot ensure that we will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements, that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor, or that a breakdown in such negotiations will not result in the disruption of our operations. Although we have generally enjoyed good relations with both our unionized and non-unionized employees, we may experience an adverse impact on our operating results if we are subject to labor actions.Our earnings and margins depend in part on subcontractor performance, as well as raw material and component availability and pricing.Our businesses depend on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials and components. At times subcontractors perform services that we provide to our customers. We depend on these subcontractors and vendors to meet their contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements. Nonperformance or underperformance by subcontractors and vendors could materially impact our ability to perform obligations to our customers, which could result in a customer terminating our contract for default, expose us to liability, and substantially impair our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. Generally, raw materials and purchased components are available from a number of different suppliers, though several suppliers are our sole source of certain components. If a sole-source supplier should cease or otherwise be unable to deliver such components, our operating results could be adversely impacted. In addition, our supply networks can sometimes experience price fluctuations. Our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor may be adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers are unable to provide the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner. While we have attempted to mitigate the effects of increased costs through price increases, there are no assurances that higher prices can effectively be passed through to our customers or that we will be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw materials costs through price increases on a timely basis.Our business involves risks associated with complex manufacturing processes.Our manufacturing processes depend on certain sophisticated and high-value equipment. Unexpected failures of this equipment may result in production delays, revenue loss, and significant repair costs. In addition, equipment failures could result in injuries to our employees. Moreover, the competitive nature of our businesses requires us to continuously implement process changes intended to achieve product improvements and manufacturing efficiencies. These process changes may at times result in production delays, quality concerns, and increased costs. Any disruption of operations at our facilities due to equipment failures or process interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business.The airline industry is heavily regulated, and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements, our results of operations could suffer.Governmental agencies throughout the world, including the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the European Aviation Safety Agency, prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components, including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although compliance with FAA requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries. We include documentation with our products sold to aircraft manufacturing customers certifying that each part complies with applicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. In order to sell our products, the Corporation as well as the products we manufacture must also be certified by our individual original equipment manufacturers (OEM) customers. If any of the material authorizations or approvals qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended, then the sale of the such product would be prohibited by law, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.14From time to time, the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations, which are usually more stringent than existing regulations. If these proposed regulations are adopted and enacted, we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop new technologies.Virtually all of the products produced and sold by us are highly engineered and require sophisticated manufacturing and system-integration techniques and capabilities. The commercial and government markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies. The product and program needs of our government and commercial customers change and evolve regularly. Accordingly, our future performance depends in part on our ability to: identify emerging technological trends in our current and target markets, develop and manufacture competitive products, systems, and services, enhance our offerings by adding technological innovations that differentiate our products, systems, and services from those of our competitors, and develop, manufacture, and bring those products, systems, and service to market quickly at cost-effective prices.We self-insure health benefits and may be adversely impacted by unfavorable claims experience.We are self-insured for our health benefits. If the number or severity of claims increases, or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than our original assessment, our operating results would be adversely affected. Our future claims expense might exceed historical levels, which could reduce our earnings. We expect to periodically assess our self-insurance strategy. We are required to periodically evaluate and adjust our claims reserves to reflect our experience. However, ultimate results may differ from our estimates, which could result in losses over our reserved amounts. In addition, because we do not carry “stop loss” insurance, a significant increase in the number of claims that we must cover under our self-insurance retainage could adversely affect our profitability.Increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.Our earnings may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of income or expense we record for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. U.S. GAAP requires that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions relating to financial markets and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can change the assumptions. The most significant year-end assumptions used to estimate pension or other postretirement benefit expense for the following year are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, expected future medical cost inflation, and expected compensation increases. In addition, we are required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant change to equity through a reduction or increase to other comprehensive income. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement benefit plans accounting policies, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies—Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.  Although U.S. GAAP expense and pension or other postretirement contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect U.S. GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash we would contribute to the pension or other postretirement plans. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law, Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and discretionary contributions to improve the plans’ funded status. An obligation to make contributions to pension plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses.Implementing our acquisition strategy involves risks, and our failure to successfully implement this strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business.As part of our capital allocation strategy, we aim to grow our business by selectively pursuing acquisitions to supplement our organic growth.  We are continuing to actively pursue additional acquisition opportunities, some of which may be material to our business and financial performance.  Although we have been successful with this strategy in the past, we may not be able to grow our business in the future through acquisitions for a number of reasons, including:•Encountering difficulties identifying and executing acquisitions; •Increased competition for targets, which may increase acquisition costs; •Consolidation in our industry, reducing the number of acquisition targets; •Competition laws and regulations preventing us from making certain acquisitions; and •Acquisition financing not being available on acceptable terms or at all.15In addition, there are potential risks associated with growing our business through acquisitions, including the failure to successfully integrate and realize the expected benefits of an acquisition.  For example, with any past or future acquisition, there is the possibility that:•The business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture; •Technological and product synergies, economies of scale, or cost reductions may not occur as expected; •Management may be distracted from overseeing existing operations by the need to integrate acquired businesses; •We may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities; •We may experience unforeseen difficulties in integrating operations and systems;•We may fail to retain or assimilate employees of the acquired business;•We may experience problems in retaining customers or integrating customer bases; and•We may encounter difficulties in entering new markets in which we may have little or no experience.Failure to successfully implement our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Future terror attacks, war, natural disasters, or other events beyond our control could adversely impact our businesses.Despite our concerted effort to minimize risk to our production capabilities and corporate information systems and to reduce the effect of unforeseen interruptions through business continuity planning and disaster recovery plans, we could be adversely impacted by terror attacks, war, natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, pandemic diseases, or other events such as strikes by the workforce of a significant customer or supplier. These risks could negatively impact demand for or supply of our products and could also cause disruption to our facilities or systems, which could also interrupt operational processes and adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products and provide services and support to our customers. We operate facilities in areas of the world that are exposed to natural disasters. Financial difficulties of our customers, delays by our customers in production of their products, high fuel prices, the concern of another major terrorist attack, and the overall decreased demand for our products could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition"
0,CW,CURTISS-WRIGHT CORP,2017-02-21,"Risk Factors
.8We have summarized below the significant, known material risks to our business. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely impacted if any of these risks materialize. Additional risk factors not currently known to us or that we believe are immaterial may also impair our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The risk factors below should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as other required filings by us to the Securities Exchange Commission, such as our Form 10-Q’s, Form 8-K’s, proxy statements for our annual shareholder meetings, and subsequent amendments, if any.A substantial portion of our revenues and earnings depends upon the continued willingness of the U.S. Government and our other customers in the defense industry to buy our products and services.In 2016, approximately 32% of our domestic sales were derived from or related to defense programs.  U.S. defense spending has historically been cyclical, and defense budgets tend to rise when perceived threats to national security increase the level of concern over the country’s safety. At other times, spending by the military can decrease. Competing demands for federal funds can put pressure on all areas of discretionary spending, which could ultimately impact the defense budget. A decrease in U.S. Government defense spending or changes in spending allocation could result in one or more of our programs being reduced, delayed, or terminated. Reductions in defense industry spending may or may not have an adverse effect on programs for which we provide products and services. In the event expenditures are reduced for products we manufacture or services we provide and are not offset by revenues from foreign sales, new programs, or products or services that we currently manufacture or provide, we may experience a reduction in our revenues and earnings and a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If we fail to satisfy our contractual obligations, our contracts may be terminated and we may incur significant costs or liabilities, including liquidated damages and penalties.In general, our contracts may be terminated for our failure to satisfy our contractual obligations. In addition, some of our contracts contain substantial liquidated damages provisions and financial penalties related to our failure to satisfy our contractual obligations. For example, the terms of the Electro-Mechanical Division's AP1000 China and AP1000 United States contracts with Westinghouse include liquidated damage penalty provisions for failure to meet contractual delivery dates if we caused the delay and the delay was not excusable.  On October 10, 2013, we received a letter from Westinghouse stating entitlements to the maximum amount of liquidated damages allowable under the AP1000 China contract of approximately $25 million.  To date, we have not met certain contractual delivery dates under the AP 1000 China and domestic contracts; however there are significant uncertainties as to which parties are responsible for the delays, and we believe we have adequate legal defenses. Consequently, as a result of the above matters, we may incur significant costs or liabilities, including penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. As of December 31, 2016, the range of possible loss for liquidated damages on the Westinghouse domestic and China contracts is $0 to $55.5 million.As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations.We must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business. A violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties or the termination of our contracts or debarment from bidding on contracts. These fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards, receiving or paying kickbacks, or filing false claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies. The failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation. It could also result in our progress payments being withheld. In some instances, these laws and regulations impose terms or rights that are more favorable to the government than those typically available to commercial parties in negotiated transactions. For example, the U.S. Government may terminate any of our government contracts and, in general, subcontracts, at its convenience as well as for default based on performance. Upon termination for convenience of a fixed-price type contract, we normally are entitled to receive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement for allowable costs for work-in-process, and an allowance for profit on work actually completed on the contract or adjustment for loss if completion of performance would have resulted in a loss. Upon termination for convenience of a cost reimbursement contract, we normally are entitled to reimbursement of allowable costs plus a portion of the fee. Such allowable costs would normally include our cost to terminate agreements with our suppliers and subcontractors. The amount of the fee recovered, if any, is related to the portion of the work accomplished prior to termination and is determined by negotiation.A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. In addition, on those contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime 9contractor, the U.S. Government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor, irrespective of the quality of our services as a subcontractor.In addition, our U.S. Government contracts typically span one or more base years and multiple option years. The U.S. Government generally has the right to not exercise option periods and may not exercise an option period if the agency is not satisfied with our performance on the contract or does not receive funding to continue the program. U.S. Government procurement may adversely affect our cash flow or program profitability.A significant reduction in the purchase of our products by the U.S. government could have a material adverse effect on our business. The risk that governmental purchases of our products may decline stems from the nature of our business with the U.S. government, where it may:•terminate, reduce, or modify contracts or subcontracts if its requirements or budgetary constraints change;•cancel multi-year contracts and related orders if funds become unavailable; and •shift its spending priorities.In addition, as a defense contractor, we are subject to risks in connection with government contracts, including without limitation:•the frequent need to bid on programs prior to completing the necessary design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and/or cost overruns;•the difficulty in forecasting long-term costs and schedules and the potential obsolescence of products related to long-term, fixed price contracts;•contracts with varying fixed terms that may not be renewed or followed by follow-on contracts upon expiration;•cancellation of the follow-on production phase of contracts if program requirements are not met in the development phase;•the failure of a prime contractor customer to perform on a contract;•the fact that government contract wins can be contested by other contractors; and•the inadvertent failure to comply with any the U.S. Government rules, laws, and regulations, including the False Claims Act or the Arms Export Control Act.We use estimates when accounting for long-term contracts. Changes in estimates could affect our profitability and overall financial position.Long-term contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. For example, assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract as costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials. Similarly, assumptions have to be made regarding the future impact of efficiency initiatives and cost reduction efforts. Incentives, awards, price escalations, liquidated damages, or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance. It is possible that materially different amounts could be obtained, because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, if different assumptions were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances, or estimates may have a material adverse effect upon future period financial reporting and performance. See “Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.Our backlog is subject to reduction and cancellation, which could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.Backlog represents products or services that our customers have committed by contract to purchase from us. Total backlog includes both funded (unfilled orders for which funding is authorized, appropriated, and contractually obligated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated and/or contractually obligated by the customer). The Corporation is a subcontractor to prime contractors for the vast majority of our government business; as such, substantially all amounts in backlog are funded. Backlog excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering type contracts (e.g. Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity). Backlog is adjusted for changes in foreign exchange rates and is reduced for contract cancellations and terminations in the period in which they occur. Backlog as of December 31, 2016 was $2.0 billion. Backlog is subject to fluctuations and is not necessarily indicative of future sales. The U.S. government may unilaterally modify or cancel its contracts. In addition, under certain of our commercial contracts, our customers may unilaterally modify or terminate their orders at any time for their convenience. Accordingly, certain portions of our backlog can 10be cancelled or reduced at the option of the U.S. Government and commercial customers. Our failure to replace cancelled or reduced backlog could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.We operate in highly competitive markets.We compete against companies that often have greater sales volumes and financial, research, human, and marketing resources than we have. In addition, some of our largest customers could develop the capability to manufacture products or provide services similar to products that we manufacture or services that we provide. This would result in these customers supplying their own products or services and competing directly with us for sales of these products or services, all of which could significantly reduce our revenues. Furthermore, we are facing increased international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition. Our management believes that the principal points of competition in our markets are technology, product quality, performance, price, technical expertise, and timeliness of delivery. If we are unable to compete successfully with existing or new competitors in these areas, our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially and adversely impacted.A downturn in the aircraft market could adversely affect our business.The aerospace industry is cyclical in nature and can be adversely affected by periodic downturns by a number of factors, including a recession, increasing fuel and labor costs, intense price competition, outbreak of infectious disease, and terrorist attacks, as well as economic cycles, all of which can be unpredictable and are outside our control.  Any decrease in demand resulting from a downturn in the aerospace market could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our future growth and continued success is dependent upon our key personnel.Our success is dependent upon the efforts of our senior management personnel and our ability to attract and retain other highly qualified management and technical personnel. We face competition for management and qualified technical personnel from other companies and organizations. Therefore, we may not be able to retain our existing management and technical personnel or fill new management or technical positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover at our existing compensation levels. Although we have entered into change of control agreements with some members of senior management, we do not have employment contracts with our key executives. We have made a concerted effort to reduce the effect of the loss of our senior management personnel through management succession planning. The loss of members of our senior management and qualified technical personnel could have a material and adverse effect on our business.Our international operations are subject to risks and volatility.During 2016, approximately 30% of our consolidated revenue was from customers outside of the United States, and we have operating facilities in foreign countries. Doing business in foreign countries is subject to numerous risks, including without limitation: political and economic instability; the uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases; restrictive trade policies; changes in the local labor-relations climate; economic conditions in local markets; health concerns; and complying with foreign regulatory and tax requirements that are subject to change. While these factors or the impact of these factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations. To the extent that foreign sales are transacted in foreign currencies and we do not enter into currency hedge transactions, we are exposed to risk of losses due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly for the Canadian dollar, the Euro, Swiss franc, and the British Pound. Significant fluctuations in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Intrusion on our systems could damage our business.We store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, and confidential employee information on our servers and databases. Despite our implementation of firewalls, switchgear, and other network security measures, our servers, databases, and other systems may be vulnerable to computer hackers, physical or electronic break-ins, sabotage, computer viruses, worms, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. We continue to review and enhance our computer systems to try to prevent unauthorized and unlawful intrusions, but in the future it is possible that we may not be able to prevent all intrusions. Such intrusions could result in our network security or computer systems being compromised and possibly result in the misappropriation or corruption of sensitive information or cause disruptions in our services. We might be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against, remediate, or 11alleviate problems caused by such intrusions. Any such intrusion could cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subject us to legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.We may be unable to protect the value of our intellectual property.Obtaining, maintaining, and enforcing our intellectual property rights and avoiding infringing on the intellectual property rights of others are important factors to the operation of our business. While we take precautionary steps to protect our technological advantages and intellectual property and rely in part on patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright laws, we cannot assure that the precautionary steps we have taken will completely protect our intellectual property rights. Because patent applications in the United States are maintained in secrecy until either the patent application is published or a patent is issued, we may not be aware of third-party patents, patent applications, and other intellectual property relevant to our products that may block our use of our intellectual property or may be used in third-party products that compete with our products and processes. When others infringe on our intellectual property rights, the value of our products is diminished, and we may incur substantial litigation costs to enforce our rights. Similarly, we may incur substantial litigation costs and the obligation to pay royalties if others claim we infringed on their intellectual property rights. When we develop intellectual property and technologies with funding from U.S. Government contracts, the government has the royalty-free right to use that property.In addition to our patent rights, we also rely on unpatented technology, trade secrets, and confidential information. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques or otherwise gain access to or disclose our technology. We may not be able to protect our rights in unpatented technology, trade secrets, and confidential information effectively. We require each of our employees and consultants to execute a confidentiality agreement at the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us. There is no guarantee that we will succeed in obtaining and retaining executed agreements from all employees or consultants. Moreover, these agreements may not provide effective protection of our information or, in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure, they may not provide adequate remedies.Our future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairment charges.At December 31, 2016, we had goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of approximately $1,223 million, which represented approximately 40% of our total assets. Our goodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and is also tested whenever events and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. Any excess goodwill resulting from the impairment test must be written off in the period of determination. Intangible assets (other than goodwill) are generally amortized over the useful life of such assets. In addition, from time to time, we may acquire or make an investment in a business that will require us to record goodwill based on the purchase price and the value of the acquired assets. We may subsequently experience unforeseen issues with such business that adversely affect the anticipated returns of the business or value of the intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets for such business. Future determinations of significant write-offs of goodwill or intangible assets as a result of an impairment test or any accelerated amortization of other intangible assets could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.Our operations are subject to numerous domestic and international laws, regulations, and restrictions, and noncompliance with these laws, regulations, and restrictions could expose us to fines, penalties, suspension, or debarment, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and overall financial condition.We have contracts and operations in many parts of the world subject to United States and foreign laws and regulations, including the False Claims Act, regulations relating to import-export control (including the International Traffic in Arms Regulation promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act), technology transfer restrictions, repatriation of earnings, exchange controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act, and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act. Although we have implemented policies and procedures and provided training that we believe are sufficient to address these risks, we cannot guarantee that our operations will always comply with these laws and regulations. Failure by us, our sales representatives, or consultants to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities and could, in the extreme case, result in suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.We are subject to liability under environmental laws.Our business and facilities are subject to numerous federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to the use, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials and other waste products. Environmental laws generally 12impose liability for investigation, remediation, and removal of hazardous materials and other waste products on property owners and those who dispose of materials at waste sites, whether or not the waste was disposed of legally at the time in question. We are currently addressing environmental remediation at certain current and former facilities, and we have been named as a potentially responsible party along with other organizations in a number of environmental clean-up sites and may be named in connection with future sites. We are required to contribute to the costs of the investigation and remediation and to establish reserves in our financial statements for future costs deemed probable and estimable. Although we have estimated and reserved for future environmental remediation costs, the final resolution of these liabilities may significantly vary from our estimates and could potentially have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability.Our business operates in many locations under government jurisdictions that impose income taxes. Changes in domestic or foreign income tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or lower income tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain revenues or the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability. Corporate tax reform continues to be a priority in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. Changes to the tax system in the U.S. could have significant effects, positive or negative, on our effective tax rate and on our deferred tax assets and liabilities. In addition, audits by income tax authorities could result in unanticipated increases in our income tax expense.Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if the United States were to withdraw from or materially modify NAFTA or certain other international trade agreements, or if tariffs or other restrictions on the foreign-sourced goods that we sell were to increase.A significant portion of our business activities are conducted in foreign countries, including Mexico and China. Our business benefits from free trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and we also rely on various U.S. corporate tax provisions related to international commerce as we build, market and sell our products globally. President Trump has made comments suggesting that he is not supportive of certain existing international trade agreements, including NAFTA, and made comments suggesting that he supports significantly increasing tariffs on goods imported into the United States from certain countries such as China and Mexico. At this time, it remains unclear what actions, if any, President Trump will take with respect to NAFTA, other international trade agreements, U.S. tax provisions related to international commerce, and tariffs on goods imported into the United States. If the United States were to withdraw from or materially modify NAFTA, or other international trade agreements to which it is a party, or change corporate tax policy related to international commerce, or if tariffs were raised on the foreign-sourced goods that we sell, such goods may no longer be available at a commercially attractive price or at all, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our current debt, and debt we may incur in the future, could adversely affect our business and financial position.As of December 31, 2016, we had $951 million of debt outstanding, of which $816 million is long-term debt. Our level of debt could have significant consequences for our business including: requiring us to use our cash flow to pay the principal and interest on our debt, reducing funds available for acquisitions and other investments in our business; making us vulnerable to economic downturns and increases in interest rates; limiting us from obtaining additional debt; and impacting our ability to pay dividends.A percentage of our workforce is employed under collective bargaining agreements.Approximately 8% of our workforce is employed under collective bargaining agreements, which from time to time are subject to renewal and negotiation. We cannot ensure that we will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements, that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor, or that a breakdown in such negotiations will not result in the disruption of our operations. Although we have generally enjoyed good relations with both our unionized and non-unionized employees, if we are subject to labor actions, we may experience an adverse impact on our operating results.Our earnings and margins depend in part on subcontractor performance, as well as raw material and component availability and pricing.Our businesses depend on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials and components. At times subcontractors perform services that we provide to our customers. We depend on these subcontractors and vendors to meet their contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements. Generally, raw materials and purchased components are available from a number of different suppliers, though several suppliers are our sole source of certain components. If a sole-source supplier should cease or otherwise be unable to deliver such components, our operating results could be adversely impacted. In addition, 13our supply networks can sometimes experience price fluctuations. Our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor may be adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers are unable to provide the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner. While we have attempted to mitigate the effects of increased costs through price increases, there are no assurances that higher prices can effectively be passed through to our customers or that we will be able to offset fully or on a timely basis the effects of higher raw materials costs through price increases.Our business involves risks associated with complex manufacturing processes.Our manufacturing processes depend on certain sophisticated and high-value equipment. Unexpected failures of this equipment may result in production delays, revenue loss, and significant repair costs. In addition, equipment failures could result in injuries to our employees. Moreover, the competitive nature of our businesses requires us to continuously implement process changes intended to achieve product improvements and manufacturing efficiencies. These process changes may at times result in production delays, quality concerns, and increased costs. Any disruption of operations at our facilities due to equipment failures or process interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business.The airline industry is heavily regulated, and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements, our results of operations could suffer.Governmental agencies throughout the world, including the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the European Aviation Safety Agency, prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components, including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although compliance with FAA requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries. We include, with the products that we sell to our aircraft manufacturing customers, documentation certifying that each part complies with applicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. In order to sell our products, we and the products we manufacture must also be certified by our individual original equipment manufacturers (OEM) customers. If any of the material authorizations or approvals qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended, then the sale of the subject product would be prohibited by law, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.From time to time, the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations, which are usually more stringent than existing regulations. If these proposed regulations are adopted and enacted, we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop new technologies.Virtually all of the products produced and sold by us are highly engineered and require sophisticated manufacturing and system-integration techniques and capabilities. The commercial and government markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies. The product and program needs of our government and commercial customers change and evolve regularly. Accordingly, our future performance depends in part on our ability to identify emerging technological trends, develop and manufacture competitive products, and bring those products to market quickly at cost-effective prices.Potential product liability risks exist from the products that we sell.We manufacture highly engineered products, which may result in product liability claims against us. For example, in December 2013, we, along with other unaffiliated parties, received a claim from Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNRL) pertaining to a fire and explosion at a delayed coker unit at CNRL’s Fort McMurray refinery which resulted in the injury of five CNRL employees, damage to property and equipment, and various forms of consequential loss such as loss of profit, lost opportunities, and business interruption.  The fire and explosion occurred when a CNRL employee bypassed certain safety controls and opened an operating coker unit. The total quantum of alleged damages arising from the incident has not been finalized, but is estimated to meet or exceed $1 billion. We currently maintain what we believe to be suitable and adequate commercial, property and casualty, product liability, and other forms of insurance to cover this matter and other potential claims. The Corporation is currently unable to estimate an amount, or range of potential losses, if any, from this matter. The Corporation believes it has adequate legal defenses and intends to defend this matter vigorously. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to maintain our insurance on acceptable terms or that such insurance will provide adequate protection against these potential liabilities. In the event of a judgment against us on this matter or other claims against us, a lack of sufficient insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Moreover, even if we maintain adequate insurance, any successful claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, and on the ability to obtain suitable or adequate insurance. 14We self-insure health benefits and may be adversely impacted by unfavorable claims experience.We are self-insured for our health benefits. If the number or severity of claims increases, or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than our original assessment, our operating results would be adversely affected. Our future claims expense might exceed historical levels, which could reduce our earnings. We expect to periodically assess our self-insurance strategy. We are required to periodically evaluate and adjust our claims reserves to reflect our experience. However, ultimate results may differ from our estimates, which could result in losses over our reserved amounts. In addition, because we do not carry “stop loss” insurance, a significant increase in the number of claims that we must cover under our self-insurance retainage could adversely affect our profitability.Increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.Our earnings may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of income or expense we record for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. U.S. GAAP requires that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions relating to financial markets and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can change the assumptions. The most significant year-end assumptions used to estimate pension or other postretirement benefit expense for the following year are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, expected future medical cost inflation, and expected compensation increases. In addition, we are required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant change to equity through a reduction or increase to other comprehensive income. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement benefit plans accounting policies, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies—Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.  Although U.S. GAAP expense and pension or other postretirement contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect U.S. GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash the company would contribute to the pension or other postretirement plans. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law, Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and discretionary contributions to improve the plans’ funded status. An obligation to make contributions to pension plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses.Our operating results and financial condition may be adversely impacted by the current worldwide economic conditions.We currently generate significant operating cash flows, which combined with access to the credit markets provides us with significant discretionary funding capacity. However, financial markets in the United States, Europe, and Asia had experienced extreme disruption in previous years, that included, among other things, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others. While previously these conditions had not impaired our ability to operate our business, there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets and confidence in major economies, which could impact customer demand for our products as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers, and creditors. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of a disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions and the effects they will have on our business and financial condition.Implementing our acquisition strategy involves risks, and our failure to successfully implement this strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business.As part of our capital allocation strategy, we aim to grow our business by selectively pursuing acquisitions to supplement our organic growth.  We are continuing to actively pursue additional acquisition opportunities, some of which may be material to our business and financial performance.  Although we have been successful with this strategy in the past, we may not be able to grow our business in the future through acquisitions for a number of reasons, including:•Encountering difficulties identifying and executing acquisitions; •Increased competition for targets, which may increase acquisition costs; •Consolidation in our industry reducing the number of acquisition targets; •Competition laws and regulations preventing us from making certain acquisitions; and •Acquisition financing not being available on acceptable terms or at all.15In addition, there are potential risks associated with growing our business through acquisitions, including the failure to successfully integrate and realize the expected benefits of an acquisition.  For example, with any past or future acquisition, there is the possibility that:•The business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture; •Technological and product synergies, economies of scale and cost reductions may not occur as expected; •Management may be distracted from overseeing existing operations by the need to integrate acquired businesses; •We may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities; •Unforeseen difficulties may arise in integrating operations and systems;•We may fail to retain and assimilate employees of the acquired business;•We may experience problems in retaining customers and integrating customer bases; and•Problems may arise in entering new markets in which we may have little or no experience.Failure to successfully implement our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.War, natural disasters, or other events beyond our control could adversely impact our businesses.Despite our concerted effort to minimize risk to our production capabilities and corporate information systems and to reduce the effect of unforeseen interruptions to us through business continuity planning and disaster recovery plans, war, natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, pandemic diseases, or other events, such as strikes by a significant customer’s or supplier’s workforce, could adversely impact demand for or supply of our products and could also cause disruption to our facilities or systems, which could also interrupt operational processes and adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products and provide services and support to our customers. We operate facilities in areas of the world that are exposed to natural disasters, such as but not limited to hurricanes, floods, tornados, and pandemic diseases. Financial difficulties of our customers, delays by our customers in production of their products, high fuel prices, the concern of another major terrorist attack, and the overall decreased demand for our products could adversely affect our operating results and financial position.A resurgence of terrorist activity around the world could cause economic conditions to deteriorate and adversely impact our businesses. In the past, terrorist attacks have negatively impacted general economic, market, and political conditions. In particular, the 2001 terrorist attacks, compounded with changes in the national economy, resulted in reduced revenues in the aerospace and general industrial markets in 2002 and 2003. Although economic conditions have improved considerably, additional terrorist acts such as the 2015 Paris terrorist attacks could cause damage or disruption to our business, our facilities, or our employees, which could significantly impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations. The potential for additional future terrorist attacks and the national and international responses to terrorist attacks, have created many economic and political uncertainties, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations in ways that cannot presently be predicted. In addition, with manufacturing facilities located worldwide, including facilities located in the United States, Western Europe, and the People’s Republic of China, we may be impacted by terrorist actions not only against the United States but in other parts of the world as well. In some cases, we are not insured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts"
2,CW,CURTISS-WRIGHT CORP,2016-02-25,"Risk Factors
.8We have summarized below the significant, known material risks to our business. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely impacted if any of these risks materialize. Additional risk factors not currently known to us or that we believe are immaterial may also impair our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The risk factors below should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as other required filings by us to the Securities Exchange Commission, such as our Form 10-Q’s, Form 8-K’s, proxy statements for our annual shareholder meetings, and subsequent amendments, if any.A substantial portion of our revenues and earnings depends upon the continued willingness of the U.S. Government and our other customers in the defense industry to buy our products and services.In 2015, approximately 30% of our sales were derived from or related to defense programs.  U.S. defense spending has historically been cyclical, and defense budgets tend to rise when perceived threats to national security increase the level of concern over the country’s safety. At other times, spending by the military can decrease. Competing demands for federal funds can put pressure on all areas of discretionary spending, which could ultimately impact the defense budget. A decrease in U.S. Government defense spending or changes in spending allocation could result in one or more of our programs being reduced, delayed, or terminated. Reductions in defense industry spending may or may not have an adverse effect on programs for which we provide products and services. In the event expenditures are reduced for products we manufacture or services we provide and are not offset by revenues from foreign sales, new programs, or products or services that we currently manufacture or provide, we may experience a reduction in our revenues and earnings and a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If we fail to satisfy our contractual obligations, our contracts may be terminated and we may incur significant costs or liabilities, including liquidated damages and penalties.In general, our contracts may be terminated for our failure to satisfy our contractual obligations. In addition, some of our contracts contain substantial liquidated damages provisions and financial penalties related to our failure to satisfy our contractual obligations. For example, the terms of the Electro-Mechanical Division's AP1000 China and AP1000 United States contracts with Westinghouse include liquidated damage penalty provisions for failure to meet contractual delivery dates if we caused the delay and the delay was not excusable.  On October 10, 2013, we received a letter from Westinghouse stating entitlements to the maximum amount of liquidated damages allowable under the AP1000 China contract of approximately $25 million.  To date, we have not met certain contractual delivery dates under the AP 1000 China and domestic contracts; however there are significant uncertainties as to which parties are responsible for the delays, and we believe we have adequate legal defenses. Consequently, as a result of the above matters, we may incur significant costs or liabilities, including penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. As of December 31, 2015, the range of possible loss for liquidated damages is $0 to $48 million. As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations.We must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business. A violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties or the termination of our contracts or debarment from bidding on contracts. These fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards, receiving or paying kickbacks, or filing false claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies. The failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation. It could also result in our progress payments being withheld.In some instances, these laws and regulations impose terms or rights that are more favorable to the government than those typically available to commercial parties in negotiated transactions. For example, the U.S. Government may terminate any of our government contracts and, in general, subcontracts, at its convenience as well as for default based on performance. Upon termination for convenience of a fixed-price type contract, we normally are entitled to receive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement for allowable costs for work-in-process, and an allowance for profit on work actually completed on the contract or adjustment for loss if completion of performance would have resulted in a loss. Upon termination for convenience of a cost reimbursement contract, we normally are entitled to reimbursement of allowable costs plus a portion of the fee. Such allowable costs would normally include our cost to terminate agreements with our suppliers and subcontractors. The amount of the fee recovered, if any, is related to the portion of the work accomplished prior to termination and is determined by negotiation.A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. In addition, on those contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime 9contractor, the U.S. Government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor, irrespective of the quality of our services as a subcontractor.In addition, our U.S. Government contracts typically span one or more base years and multiple option years. The U.S. Government generally has the right to not exercise option periods and may not exercise an option period if the agency is not satisfied with our performance on the contract or does not receive funding to continue the program. U.S. Government procurement may adversely affect our cash flow or program profitability.A significant reduction in the purchase of our products by the U.S. government could have a material adverse effect on our business. The risk that governmental purchases of our products may decline stems from the nature of our business with the U.S. government, where it may:•terminate, reduce, or modify contracts or subcontracts if its requirements or budgetary constraints change;•cancel multi-year contracts and related orders if funds become unavailable; and •shift its spending priorities.In addition, as a defense contractor, we are subject to risks in connection with government contracts, including without limitation:•the frequent need to bid on programs prior to completing the necessary design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and/or cost overruns;•the difficulty in forecasting long-term costs and schedules and the potential obsolescence of products related to long-term, fixed price contracts;•contracts with varying fixed terms that may not be renewed or followed by follow-on contracts upon expiration;•cancellation of the follow-on production phase of contracts if program requirements are not met in the development phase;•the failure of a prime contractor customer to perform on a contract;•the fact that government contract wins can be contested by other contractors; and•the inadvertent failure to comply with any the U.S. Government rules, laws, and regulations, including the False Claims Act or the Arms Export Control Act.We use estimates when accounting for long-term contracts. Changes in estimates could affect our profitability and overall financial position.Long-term contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. For example, assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract as costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials. Similarly, assumptions have to be made regarding the future impact of efficiency initiatives and cost reduction efforts. Incentives, awards, price escalations, liquidated damages, or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance. It is possible that materially different amounts could be obtained, because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, if different assumptions were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances, or estimates may have a material adverse effect upon future period financial reporting and performance. See “Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies” in Part II, Item 7 of this form 10-K.Our backlog is subject to reduction and cancellation, which could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.Backlog represents products or services that our customers have committed by contract to purchase from us. Total backlog includes both funded (unfilled orders for which funding is authorized, appropriated, and contractually obligated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated and/or contractually obligated by the customer). The Corporation is a subcontractor to prime contractors for the vast majority of our government business; as such, substantially all amounts in backlog are funded. Backlog excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering type contracts (e.g. Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity). Backlog is adjusted for changes in foreign exchange rates and is reduced for contract cancellations and terminations in the period in which they occur. Backlog as of December 31, 2015 was $1,929 million. Backlog is subject to fluctuations and is not necessarily indicative of future sales. The U.S. government may unilaterally modify or cancel its contracts. In addition, under certain of our commercial contracts, our customers may unilaterally modify or terminate their orders at any time for their convenience. Accordingly, certain portions of 10our backlog can be cancelled or reduced at the option of the U.S. Government and commercial customers. Our failure to replace cancelled or reduced backlog could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.We operate in highly competitive markets.We compete against companies that often have greater sales volumes and financial, research, human, and marketing resources than we have. In addition, some of our largest customers could develop the capability to manufacture products or provide services similar to products that we manufacture or services that we provide. This would result in these customers supplying their own products or services and competing directly with us for sales of these products or services, all of which could significantly reduce our revenues. Furthermore, we are facing increased international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition. Our management believes that the principal points of competition in our markets are technology, product quality, performance, price, technical expertise, and timeliness of delivery. If we are unable to compete successfully with existing or new competitors in these areas, our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially and adversely impacted.A downturn in the aircraft market could adversely affect our business.The aerospace industry is cyclical in nature and can be adversely affected by periodic downturns by a number of factors, including a recession, increasing fuel and labor costs, intense price competition, outbreak of infectious disease, and terrorist attacks, as well as economic cycles, all of which can be unpredictable and are outside our control.  Any decrease in demand resulting from a downturn in the aerospace market could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our future growth and continued success is dependent upon our key personnel.Our success is dependent upon the efforts of our senior management personnel and our ability to attract and retain other highly qualified management and technical personnel. We face competition for management and qualified technical personnel from other companies and organizations. Therefore, we may not be able to retain our existing management and technical personnel or fill new management or technical positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover at our existing compensation levels. Although we have entered into change of control agreements with some members of senior management, we do not have employment contracts with our key executives. We have made a concerted effort to reduce the effect of the loss of our senior management personnel through management succession planning. The loss of members of our senior management and qualified technical personnel could have a material and adverse effect on our business.Our international operations are subject to risks and volatility.During 2015, approximately 32% of our consolidated revenue was from customers outside of the United States, and we have operating facilities in foreign countries. Doing business in foreign countries is subject to numerous risks, including without limitation: political and economic instability; the uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases; restrictive trade policies; changes in the local labor-relations climate; economic conditions in local markets; health concerns; and complying with foreign regulatory and tax requirements that are subject to change. While these factors or the impact of these factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations. To the extent that foreign sales are transacted in foreign currencies and we do not enter into currency hedge transactions, we are exposed to risk of losses due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly for the Canadian dollar, the Euro, Swiss franc, and the British pound. Significant fluctuations in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.We may be unable to protect the value of our intellectual property.Obtaining, maintaining, and enforcing our intellectual property rights and avoiding infringing on the intellectual property rights of others are important factors to the operation of our business. While we take precautionary steps to protect our technological advantages and intellectual property and rely in part on patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright laws, we cannot assure that the precautionary steps we have taken will completely protect our intellectual property rights. Because patent applications in the United States are maintained in secrecy until either the patent application is published or a patent is issued, we may not be aware of third-party patents, patent applications, and other intellectual property relevant to our products that may block our use of our intellectual property or may be used in third-party products that compete with our products and processes. When others infringe on our intellectual property rights, the value of our products is diminished, and we may incur substantial 11litigation costs to enforce our rights. Similarly, we may incur substantial litigation costs and the obligation to pay royalties if others claim we infringed on their intellectual property rights. When we develop intellectual property and technologies with funding from U.S. Government contracts, the government has the royalty-free right to use that property.In addition to our patent rights, we also rely on unpatented technology, trade secrets, and confidential information. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques or otherwise gain access to or disclose our technology. We may not be able to protect our rights in unpatented technology, trade secrets, and confidential information effectively. We require each of our employees and consultants to execute a confidentiality agreement at the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us. There is no guarantee that we will succeed in obtaining and retaining executed agreements from all employees or consultants. Moreover, these agreements may not provide effective protection of our information or, in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure, they may not provide adequate remedies.Our future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairment charges.At December 31, 2015, we had goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of approximately $1,283 million, which represented approximately 42% of our total assets. Our goodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and is also tested whenever events and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. Any excess goodwill resulting from the impairment test must be written off in the period of determination. Intangible assets (other than goodwill) are generally amortized over the useful life of such assets. In addition, from time to time, we may acquire or make an investment in a business that will require us to record goodwill based on the purchase price and the value of the acquired assets. We may subsequently experience unforeseen issues with such business that adversely affect the anticipated returns of the business or value of the intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets for such business. Future determinations of significant write-offs of goodwill or intangible assets as a result of an impairment test or any accelerated amortization of other intangible assets could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.Our operations are subject to numerous domestic and international laws, regulations, and restrictions, and noncompliance with these laws, regulations, and restrictions could expose us to fines, penalties, suspension, or debarment, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and overall financial condition.We have contracts and operations in many parts of the world subject to United States and foreign laws and regulations, including the False Claims Act, regulations relating to import-export control (including the International Traffic in Arms Regulation promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act), technology transfer restrictions, repatriation of earnings, exchange controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act, and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act. Although we have implemented policies and procedures and provided training that we believe are sufficient to address these risks, we cannot guarantee that our operations will always comply with these laws and regulations. Failure by us, our sales representatives, or consultants to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities and could, in the extreme case, result in suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.We are subject to liability under environmental laws.Our business and facilities are subject to numerous federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to the use, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials and other waste products. Environmental laws generally impose liability for investigation, remediation, and removal of hazardous materials and other waste products on property owners and those who dispose of materials at waste sites, whether or not the waste was disposed of legally at the time in question. We are currently addressing environmental remediation at certain current and former facilities, and we have been named as a potentially responsible party along with other organizations in a number of environmental clean-up sites and may be named in connection with future sites. We are required to contribute to the costs of the investigation and remediation and to establish reserves in our financial statements for future costs deemed probable and estimable. Although we have estimated and reserved for future environmental remediation costs, the final resolution of these liabilities may significantly vary from our estimates and could potentially have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability.Our business operates in many locations under government jurisdictions that impose income taxes. Changes in domestic or foreign income tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or lower income tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain revenues or the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability. Corporate tax reform continues to be a priority in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. Changes to the tax system 12in the U.S. could have significant effects, positive or negative, on our effective tax rate and on our deferred tax assets and liabilities. In addition, audits by income tax authorities could result in unanticipated increases in our income tax expense.Our current debt, and debt we may incur in the future, could adversely affect our business and financial position.As of December 31, 2015, we had $954 million of debt outstanding, of which $953 million is long-term debt. Our level of debt could have significant consequences for our business including: requiring us to use our cash flow to pay the principal and interest on our debt, reducing funds available for acquisitions and other investments in our business; making us vulnerable to economic downturns and increases in interest rates; limiting us from obtaining additional debt; and impacting our ability to pay dividends.A percentage of our workforce is employed under collective bargaining agreements.Approximately 7% of our workforce is employed under collective bargaining agreements, which from time to time are subject to renewal and negotiation. We cannot ensure that we will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements, that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor, or that a breakdown in such negotiations will not result in the disruption of our operations. Although we have generally enjoyed good relations with both our unionized and non-unionized employees, if we are subject to labor actions, we may experience an adverse impact on our operating results.Our earnings and margins depend in part on subcontractor performance, as well as raw material and component availability and pricing.Our businesses depend on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials and components. At times subcontractors perform services that we provide to our customers. We depend on these subcontractors and vendors to meet their contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements. Generally, raw materials and purchased components are available from a number of different suppliers, though several suppliers are our sole source of certain components. If a sole-source supplier should cease or otherwise be unable to deliver such components, our operating results could be adversely impacted. In addition, our supply networks can sometimes experience price fluctuations. Our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor may be adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers are unable to provide the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner. While we have attempted to mitigate the effects of increased costs through price increases, there are no assurances that higher prices can effectively be passed through to our customers or that we will be able to offset fully or on a timely basis the effects of higher raw materials costs through price increases.Our business involves risks associated with complex manufacturing processes.Our manufacturing processes depend on certain sophisticated and high-value equipment. Unexpected failures of this equipment may result in production delays, revenue loss, and significant repair costs. In addition, equipment failures could result in injuries to our employees. Moreover, the competitive nature of our businesses requires us to continuously implement process changes intended to achieve product improvements and manufacturing efficiencies. These process changes may at times result in production delays, quality concerns, and increased costs. Any disruption of operations at our facilities due to equipment failures or process interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business.The airline industry is heavily regulated, and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements, our results of operations could suffer.Governmental agencies throughout the world, including the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the European Aviation Safety Agency, prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components, including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although compliance with FAA requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries. We include, with the products that we sell to our aircraft manufacturing customers, documentation certifying that each part complies with applicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. In order to sell our products, we and the products we manufacture must also be certified by our individual original equipment manufacturers (OEM) customers. If any of the material authorizations or approvals qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended, then the sale of the subject product would be prohibited by law, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.From time to time, the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations, which are usually more stringent than existing regulations. If these proposed regulations are adopted and enacted, 13we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop new technologies.Virtually all of the products produced and sold by us are highly engineered and require sophisticated manufacturing and system-integration techniques and capabilities. The commercial and government markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies. The product and program needs of our government and commercial customers change and evolve regularly. Accordingly, our future performance depends in part on our ability to identify emerging technological trends, develop and manufacture competitive products, and bring those products to market quickly at cost-effective prices.Potential product liability risks exist from the products that we sell.We manufacture highly engineered products, and such products may contain design or manufacturing errors or defects, which may result in product liability claims against us. For example, in December 2013, we, along with other unaffiliated parties, received a claim from Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNRL) pertaining to a fire and explosion at a delayed coker unit at CNRL’s Fort McMurray refinery which resulted in the injury of five CNRL employees, damage to property and equipment, and various forms of consequential loss such as loss of profit, lost opportunities, and business interruption.  The fire and explosion occurred when a CNRL employee bypassed certain safety controls and opened an operating coker unit. The total quantum of alleged damages arising from the incident has not been finalized, but is estimated to meet or exceed $1 billion. We currently maintain what we believe to be suitable and adequate commercial, property and casualty, product liability, and other forms of insurance to cover this matter and other potential claims. The Corporation is currently unable to estimate an amount, or range of potential losses, if any, from this matter. The Corporation believes it has adequate legal defenses and intends to defend this matter vigorously. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to maintain our insurance on acceptable terms or that such insurance will provide adequate protection against these potential liabilities. In the event of a judgment against us on this matter or other claims against us, a lack of sufficient insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Moreover, even if we maintain adequate insurance, any successful claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, and on the ability to obtain suitable or adequate insurance. We self-insure health benefits and may be adversely impacted by unfavorable claims experienceWe are self-insured for our health benefits. If the number or severity of claims increases, or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than our original assessment, our operating results would be adversely affected. Our future claims expense might exceed historical levels, which could reduce our earnings. We expect to periodically assess our self-insurance strategy. We are required to periodically evaluate and adjust our claims reserves to reflect our experience. However, ultimate results may differ from our estimates, which could result in losses over our reserved amounts. In addition, because we do not carry “stop loss” insurance, a significant increase in the number of claims that we must cover under our self-insurance retainage could adversely affect our profitability.Increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.Our earnings may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of income or expense we record for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. U.S. GAAP requires that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions relating to financial market and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can change the assumptions. The most significant year-end assumptions used to estimate pension or other postretirement benefit expense for the following year are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, expected future medical cost inflation, and expected compensation increases. In addition, we are required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant change to equity through a reduction or increase to other comprehensive income. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement benefit plans accounting policies, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies—Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.  Although U.S. GAAP expense and pension or other postretirement contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect U.S. GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash the company would contribute to the pension or other postretirement plans. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law, Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and discretionary contributions to improve the plans’ funded status. An obligation to make contributions to pension plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses.14Our operating results and financial condition may be adversely impacted by the current worldwide economic conditions.We currently generate significant operating cash flows, which combined with access to the credit markets provides us with significant discretionary funding capacity. However, financial markets in the United States, Europe, and Asia have been experiencing extreme disruption in recent years, including, among other things, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others. While currently these conditions have not impaired our ability to operate our business, there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets and confidence in major economies, which could impact customer demand for our products as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers, and creditors. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of a disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions and the effects they will have on our business and financial condition.Implementing our acquisition strategy involves risks, and our failure to successfully implement this strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business.One of our key strategies is to grow our business by selectively pursuing acquisitions.  Since 2002, we have completed over 50 acquisitions, and we are continuing to actively pursue additional acquisition opportunities, some of which may be material to our business and financial performance.  Although we have been successful with this strategy in the past, we may not be able to grow our business in the future through acquisitions for a number of reasons, including:•Encountering difficulties identifying and executing acquisitions; •Increased competition for targets, which may increase acquisition costs; •Consolidation in our industry reducing the number of acquisition targets; •Competition laws and regulations preventing us from making certain acquisitions; and •Acquisition financing not being available on acceptable terms or at all.In addition, there are potential risks associated with growing our business through acquisitions, including the failure to successfully integrate and realize the expected benefits of an acquisition.  For example, with any past or future acquisition, there is the possibility that:•The business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture; •Technological and product synergies, economies of scale and cost reductions may not occur as expected; •Management may be distracted from overseeing existing operations by the need to integrate acquired businesses; •We may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities; •Unforeseen difficulties may arise in integrating operations and systems;•We may fail to retain and assimilate employees of the acquired business;•We may experience problems in retaining customers and integrating customer bases; and•Problems may arise in entering new markets in which we may have little or no experience.Failure to successfully implement our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.War, natural disasters, or other events beyond our control could adversely impact our businesses.Despite our concerted effort to minimize risk to our production capabilities and corporate information systems and to reduce the effect of unforeseen interruptions to us through business continuity planning and disaster recovery plans, war, natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, pandemic diseases, or other events, such as strikes by a significant customer’s or supplier’s workforce, could adversely impact demand for or supply of our products and could also cause disruption to our facilities or systems, which could also interrupt operational processes and adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products and provide services and support to our customers. We operate facilities in areas of the world that are exposed to natural disasters, such as but not limited to hurricanes, floods, tornados, and pandemic diseases. Financial difficulties of our customers, delays by our customers in production of their products, high fuel prices, the concern of another major terrorist attack, and the overall decreased demand for our products could adversely affect our operating results and financial position.15A resurgence of terrorist activity and/or political instability around the world could cause economic conditions to deteriorate and adversely impact our businesses. In the past, terrorist attacks have negatively impacted general economic, market, and political conditions. In particular, the 2001 terrorist attacks, compounded with changes in the national economy, resulted in reduced revenues in the aerospace and general industrial markets in 2002 and 2003. Although economic conditions have improved considerably, additional terrorist acts or political instability (wherever located around the world) could cause damage or disruption to our business, our facilities, or our employees, which could significantly impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations. The potential for future terrorist attacks, the national and international responses to terrorist attacks, and political instability, have created many economic and political uncertainties, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations in ways that cannot presently be predicted. In addition, with manufacturing facilities located worldwide, including facilities located in the United States, Western Europe, and the People’s Republic of China, we may be impacted by terrorist actions not only against the United States but in other parts of the world as well. In some cases, we are not insured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts.Intrusion on our systems could damage our business.We store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, and confidential employee information on our servers and databases. Despite our implementation of firewalls, switchgear, and other network security measures, our servers, databases, and other systems may be vulnerable to computer hackers, physical or electronic break-ins, sabotage, computer viruses, worms, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. We continue to review and enhance our computer systems to try to prevent unauthorized and unlawful intrusions, but in the future it is possible that we may not be able to prevent all intrusions. Such intrusions could result in our network security or computer systems being compromised and possibly result in the misappropriation or corruption of sensitive information or cause disruptions in our services. We might be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against, remediate, or alleviate problems caused by such intrusions. Any such intrusion could cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subject us to legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.There are risks associated with owning our common stock.Like any equity security, our common stock is subject to a number of risks that may adversely impact our share price including: there is a limited trading market in our common stock; we may not in the future be able to pay dividends on our common stock; we may issue common stock for acquisitions or other purposes that could be dilutive to current stockholders; and we have various anti-takeover defenses such as our rights plan and our ability to issue preferred stock that may discourage a potential acquirer.16"
10,CW,CURTISS-WRIGHT CORP,2015-02-19,"Risk Factors
.We have summarized below the significant, known material risks to our business. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely impacted if any of these risks materialize. Additional risk factors not currently known to us or that we believe are immaterial may also impair our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The risk factors below should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Annual 8Report on Form 10-K as well as other required filings by us to the Securities Exchange Commission, such as our Form 10-Q’s, Form 8-K’s, proxy statements for our annual shareholder meetings, and subsequent amendments, if any.A substantial portion of our revenues and earnings depends upon the continued willingness of the U.S. Government and our other customers in the defense industry to buy our products and services.In 2014, approximately 33% of our revenues were derived from or related to defense programs.  U.S. defense spending has historically been cyclical, and defense budgets tend to rise when perceived threats to national security increase the level of concern over the country’s safety. At other times, spending by the military can decrease. Competing demands for federal funds can put pressure on all areas of discretionary spending, which could ultimately impact the defense budget. A decrease in U.S. Government defense spending or changes in spending allocation could result in one or more of our programs being reduced, delayed, or terminated. Reductions in defense industry spending may or may not have an adverse effect on programs for which we provide products and services. In the event expenditures are reduced for products we manufacture or services we provide and are not offset by revenues from foreign sales, new programs, or products or services that we currently manufacture or provide, we may experience a reduction in our revenues and earnings and a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If we fail to satisfy our contractual obligations, our contracts may be terminated and we may incur significant costs or liabilities, including liquidated damages and penalties.In general, our contracts may be terminated for our failure to satisfy our contractual obligations. In addition, some of our contracts contain substantial liquidated damages provisions and financial penalties related to our failure to satisfy our contractual obligations. For example, the terms of the Electro-Mechanical Division's AP1000 China and AP1000 United States contracts with Westinghouse include liquidated damage penalty provisions for failure to meet contractual delivery dates if we caused the delay and the delay was not excusable.  On October 10, 2013, we received a letter from Westinghouse stating entitlements to the maximum amount of liquidated damages allowable under the AP1000 China contract of approximately $25 million.  To date, we have not met certain contractual delivery dates under the AP 1000 China and domestic contracts; however there are significant uncertainties as to which parties are responsible for the delays, and we believe we have adequate legal defenses. Consequently, as a result of the above matters, we may incur significant costs or liabilities, including penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. As of December 31, 2014, the range of possible loss for liquidated damages is $0 to $40 million. As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations.We must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business. A violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties or the termination of our contracts or debarment from bidding on contracts. These fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards, receiving or paying kickbacks, or filing false claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies. The failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation. It could also result in our progress payments being withheld.In some instances, these laws and regulations impose terms or rights that are more favorable to the government than those typically available to commercial parties in negotiated transactions. For example, the U.S. Government may terminate any of our government contracts and, in general, subcontracts, at its convenience as well as for default based on performance. Upon termination for convenience of a fixed-price type contract, we normally are entitled to receive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement for allowable costs for work-in-process, and an allowance for profit on work actually completed on the contract or adjustment for loss if completion of performance would have resulted in a loss. Upon termination for convenience of a cost reimbursement contract, we normally are entitled to reimbursement of allowable costs plus a portion of the fee. Such allowable costs would normally include our cost to terminate agreements with our suppliers and subcontractors. The amount of the fee recovered, if any, is related to the portion of the work accomplished prior to termination and is determined by negotiation.A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. In addition, on those contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor, the U.S. Government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor, irrespective of the quality of our services as a subcontractor.9In addition, our U.S. Government contracts typically span one or more base years and multiple option years. The U.S. Government generally has the right to not exercise option periods and may not exercise an option period if the agency is not satisfied with our performance on the contract or does not receive funding to continue the program. U.S. Government procurement may adversely affect our cash flow or program profitability.A significant reduction in the purchase of our products by the U.S. government could have a material adverse effect on our business. The risk that governmental purchases of our products may decline stems from the nature of our business with the U.S. government, where it may:•terminate, reduce, or modify contracts or subcontracts if its requirements or budgetary constraints change;•cancel multi-year contracts and related orders if funds become unavailable; and •shift its spending priorities.In addition, as a defense contractor, we are subject to risks in connection with government contracts, including without limitation:•the frequent need to bid on programs prior to completing the necessary design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and/or cost overruns;•the difficulty in forecasting long-term costs and schedules and the potential obsolescence of products related to long-term, fixed price contracts;•contracts with varying fixed terms that may not be renewed or followed by follow-on contracts upon expiration;•cancellation of the follow-on production phase of contracts if program requirements are not met in the development phase;•the failure of a prime contractor customer to perform on a contract;•the fact that government contract wins can be contested by other contractors; and•the inadvertent failure to comply with any the U.S. Government rules, laws, and regulations, including the False Claims Act or the Arms Export Control Act.We use estimates when accounting for long-term contracts. Changes in estimates could affect our profitability and overall financial position.Long-term contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. For example, assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract as costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials. Similarly, assumptions have to be made regarding the future impact of efficiency initiatives and cost reduction efforts. Incentives, awards, price escalations, liquidated damages, or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance. It is possible that materially different amounts could be obtained, because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, if different assumptions were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances, or estimates may have a material adverse effect upon future period financial reporting and performance. See “Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies” in Part II, Item 7 of this form 10-K.Our backlog is subject to reduction and cancellation, which could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.Backlog represents products or services that our customers have committed by contract to purchase from us. Total backlog includes both funded (unfilled orders for which funding is authorized, appropriated, and contractually obligated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated and/or contractually obligated by the customer). The Corporation is a subcontractor to prime contractors for the vast majority of our government business; as such, substantially all amounts in backlog are funded. Backlog excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering type contracts (e.g. Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity). Backlog is adjusted for changes in foreign exchange rates and is reduced for contract cancellations and terminations in the period in which they occur. Backlog as of December 31, 2014 was $1,674 million. Backlog is subject to fluctuations and is not necessarily indicative of future sales. The U.S. government may unilaterally modify or cancel its contracts. In addition, under certain of our commercial contracts, our customers may unilaterally modify or terminate their orders at any time for their convenience. Accordingly, certain portions of our backlog can be cancelled or reduced at the option of the U.S. government and commercial customers. Our failure to replace cancelled or reduced backlog could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.We operate in highly competitive markets.10We compete against companies that often have greater sales volumes and financial, research, human, and marketing resources than we have. In addition, some of our largest customers could develop the capability to manufacture products or provide services similar to products that we manufacture or services that we provide. This would result in these customers supplying their own products or services and competing directly with us for sales of these products or services, all of which could significantly reduce our revenues. Furthermore, we are facing increased international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition. Our management believes that the principal points of competition in our markets are technology, product quality, performance, price, technical expertise, and timeliness of delivery. If we are unable to compete successfully with existing or new competitors in these areas, our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, could be materially and adversely impacted.Our future growth and continued success is dependent upon our key personnel.Our success is dependent upon the efforts of our senior management personnel and our ability to attract and retain other highly qualified management and technical personnel. We face competition for management and qualified technical personnel from other companies and organizations. Therefore, we may not be able to retain our existing management and technical personnel or fill new management or technical positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover at our existing compensation levels. Although we have entered into change of control agreements with some members of senior management, we do not have employment contracts with our key executives. We have made a concerted effort to reduce the effect of the loss of our senior management personnel through management succession planning. The loss of members of our senior management and qualified technical personnel could have a material and adverse effect on our business.Our international operations are subject to risks and volatility.During 2014, approximately 32% of our consolidated revenue was from customers outside of the United States, and we have operating facilities in foreign countries. Doing business in foreign countries is subject to numerous risks, including without limitation: political and economic instability; the uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases; restrictive trade policies; and complying with foreign regulatory and tax requirements that are subject to change. While these factors or the impact of these factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations. To the extent that foreign sales are transacted in foreign currencies and we do not enter into currency hedge transactions, we are exposed to risk of losses due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly for the Canadian dollar, the Euro, Swiss franc, and the British pound. Significant fluctuations in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.We may be unable to protect the value of our intellectual property.Obtaining, maintaining, and enforcing our intellectual property rights and avoiding infringing on the intellectual property rights of others are important factors to the operation of our business. While we take precautionary steps to protect our technological advantages and intellectual property and rely in part on patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright laws, we cannot assure that the precautionary steps we have taken will completely protect our intellectual property rights. Because patent applications in the United States are maintained in secrecy until either the patent application is published or a patent is issued, we may not be aware of third-party patents, patent applications, and other intellectual property relevant to our products that may block our use of our intellectual property or may be used in third-party products that compete with our products and processes. When others infringe on our intellectual property rights, the value of our products is diminished, and we may incur substantial litigation costs to enforce our rights. Similarly, we may incur substantial litigation costs and the obligation to pay royalties if others claim we infringed on their intellectual property rights. When we develop intellectual property and technologies with funding from U.S. Government contracts, the government has the royalty-free right to use that property.In addition to our patent rights, we also rely on unpatented technology, trade secrets, and confidential information. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques or otherwise gain access to or disclose our technology. We may not be able to protect our rights in unpatented technology, trade secrets, and confidential information effectively. We require each of our employees and consultants to execute a confidentiality agreement at the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us. There is no guarantee that we will succeed in obtaining and retaining executed agreements from all employees or consultants. Moreover, these agreements may not provide effective protection of our information or, in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure, they may not provide adequate remedies.Our future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairment charges.11At December 31, 2014, we had goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of approximately $1,348 million, which represented approximately 40% of our total assets. Our goodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and is also tested whenever events and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. Any excess goodwill resulting from the impairment test must be written off in the period of determination. Intangible assets (other than goodwill) are generally amortized over the useful life of such assets. In addition, from time to time, we may acquire or make an investment in a business that will require us to record goodwill based on the purchase price and the value of the acquired assets. We may subsequently experience unforeseen issues with such business that adversely affect the anticipated returns of the business or value of the intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets for such business. Future determinations of significant write-offs of goodwill or intangible assets as a result of an impairment test or any accelerated amortization of other intangible assets could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.Our operations are subject to numerous domestic and international laws, regulations, and restrictions, and noncompliance with these laws, regulations, and restrictions could expose us to fines, penalties, suspension, or debarment, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and overall financial condition.We have contracts and operations in many parts of the world subject to United States and foreign laws and regulations, including the False Claims Act, regulations relating to import-export control (including the International Traffic in Arms Regulation promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act), technology transfer restrictions, repatriation of earnings, exchange controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act, and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act. Although we have implemented policies and procedures and provided training that we believe are sufficient to address these risks, we cannot guarantee that our operations will always comply with these laws and regulations. Failure by us or our sales representatives or consultants to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities and could, in the extreme case, result in suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.We are subject to liability under environmental laws.Our business and facilities are subject to numerous federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to the use, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials and other waste products. Environmental laws generally impose liability for investigation, remediation, and removal of hazardous materials and other waste products on property owners and those who dispose of materials at waste sites, whether or not the waste was disposed of legally at the time in question. We are currently addressing environmental remediation at certain current and former facilities, and we have been named as a potentially responsible party along with other organizations in a number of environmental clean-up sites and may be named in connection with future sites. We are required to contribute to the costs of the investigation and remediation and to establish reserves in our financial statements for future costs deemed probable and estimable. Although we have estimated and reserved for future environmental remediation costs, the final resolution of these liabilities may significantly vary from our estimates and could potentially have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability.Our business operates in many locations under government jurisdictions that impose income taxes. Changes in domestic or foreign income tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or lower income tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain revenues or the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability. Corporate tax reform continues to be a priority in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. Changes to the tax system in the U.S. could have significant effects, positive or negative, on our effective tax rate and on our deferred tax assets and liabilities. In addition, audits by income tax authorities could result in unanticipated increases in our income tax expense.Our current debt, and debt we may incur in the future, could adversely affect our business and financial position.As of December 31, 2014, we had $954 million of debt outstanding, of which $953 million is long-term debt. Our level of debt could have significant consequences for our business including: requiring us to use our cash flow to pay the principal and interest on our debt, reducing funds available for acquisitions and other investments in our business; making us vulnerable to economic downturns and increases in interest rates; limiting us from obtaining additional debt; and impacting our ability to pay dividends.A percentage of our workforce is employed under collective bargaining agreements.12Approximately 6% of our workforce is employed under collective bargaining agreements, which from time to time are subject to renewal and negotiation. We cannot ensure that we will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements, that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor, or that a breakdown in such negotiations will not result in the disruption of our operations. Although we have generally enjoyed good relations with both our unionized and non-unionized employees, if we are subject to labor actions, we may experience an adverse impact on our operating results.For example, on August 24, 2012, the Electronic Mechanical Division (EMD) of Curtiss Wright’s Defense segment experienced a strike at its Cheswick, Pennsylvania facility. The financial impacts of the strike were an $18 million and$6 million shift in revenue and operating income, respectively, from 2012 to 2013, due to the temporary suspension of work, and an additional $5 million unfavorable impact to operating income as a result of unrecoverable absorption of overhead costs.Our earnings and margins depend in part on subcontractor performance, as well as raw material and component availability and pricing.Our businesses depend on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials and components. At times subcontractors perform services that we provide to our customers. We depend on these subcontractors and vendors to meet their contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements. Generally, raw materials and purchased components are available from a number of different suppliers, though several suppliers are our sole source of certain components. If a sole-source supplier should cease or otherwise be unable to deliver such components, our operating results could be adversely impacted. In addition, our supply networks can sometimes experience price fluctuations. Our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor may be adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers are unable to provide the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner. While we have attempted to mitigate the effects of increased costs through price increases, there are no assurances that higher prices can effectively be passed through to our customers or that we will be able to offset fully or on a timely basis the effects of higher raw materials costs through price increases.Our business involves risks associated with complex manufacturing processes.Our manufacturing processes depend on certain sophisticated and high-value equipment. Unexpected failures of this equipment may result in production delays, revenue loss, and significant repair costs. In addition, equipment failures could result in injuries to our employees. Moreover, the competitive nature of our businesses requires us to continuously implement process changes intended to achieve product improvements and manufacturing efficiencies. These process changes may at times result in production delays, quality concerns, and increased costs. Any disruption of operations at our facilities due to equipment failures or process interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business.The airline industry is heavily regulated, and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements, our results of operations could suffer.Governmental agencies throughout the world, including the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the European Aviation Safety Agency, prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components, including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although compliance with FAA requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries. We include, with the products that we sell to our aircraft manufacturing customers, documentation certifying that each part complies with applicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. In order to sell our products, we and the products we manufacture must also be certified by our individual OEM customers. If any of the material authorizations or approvals qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended, then the sale of the subject product would be prohibited by law, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.From time to time, the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations, which are usually more stringent than existing regulations. If these proposed regulations are adopted and enacted, we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop new technologies.Virtually all of the products produced and sold by us are highly engineered and require sophisticated manufacturing and system-integration techniques and capabilities. The commercial and government markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies. The product and program needs of our government and commercial customers change and 13evolve regularly. Accordingly, our future performance depends in part on our ability to identify emerging technological trends, develop and manufacture competitive products, and bring those products to market quickly at cost-effective prices.Potential product liability risks exist from the products that we sell.We manufacture highly engineered products, and such products may contain design or manufacturing errors or defects, which may result in product liability claims against us. For example, in December 2013, we, along with other unaffiliated parties, received a claim from Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNRL) pertaining to a fire and explosion at a delayed coker unit at CNRL’s Fort McMurray refinery which resulted in the injury of five CNRL employees, damage to property and equipment, and various forms of consequential loss such as loss of profit, lost opportunities, and business interruption.  The fire and explosion occurred when a CNRL employee bypassed certain safety controls and opened an operating coker unit. The total quantum of alleged damages arising from the incident has not been finalized, but is estimated to meet or exceed $1 billion. We currently maintain what we believe to be suitable and adequate commercial, property and casualty, product liability, and other forms of insurance to cover this matter and other potential claims. The Corporation is currently unable to estimate an amount, or range of potential losses, if any, from this matter. The Corporation believes it has adequate legal defenses and intends to defend this matter vigorously. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to maintain our insurance on acceptable terms or that such insurance will provide adequate protection against these potential liabilities. In the event of a judgment against us on this matter or other claims against us, a lack of sufficient insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Moreover, even if we maintain adequate insurance, any successful claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, and on the ability to obtain suitable or adequate insurance. We self-insure health benefits and may be adversely impacted by unfavorable claims experienceWe are self-insured for our health benefits. If the number or severity of claims increases, or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than our original assessment, our operating results would be adversely affected. Our future claims expense might exceed historical levels, which could reduce our earnings. We expect to periodically assess our self-insurance strategy. We are required to periodically evaluate and adjust our claims reserves to reflect our experience. However, ultimate results may differ from our estimates, which could result in losses over our reserved amounts. In addition, because we do not carry “stop loss” insurance, a significant increase in the number of claims that we must cover under our self-insurance retainage could adversely affect our profitability.Increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.Our earnings may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of income or expense we record for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. U.S. GAAP requires that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions relating to financial market and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can change the assumptions. The most significant year-end assumptions used to estimate pension or other postretirement benefit expense for the following year are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, expected future medical cost inflation, and expected compensation increases. In addition, we are required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant change to equity through a reduction or increase to other comprehensive income. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement benefit plans accounting policies, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies—Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.  Although U.S. GAAP expense and pension or other postretirement contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect U.S. GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash the company would contribute to the pension or other postretirement plans. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law, Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and discretionary contributions to improve the plans’ funded status. An obligation to make contributions to pension plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses.Our operating results and financial condition may be adversely impacted by the current worldwide economic conditions.We currently generate significant operating cash flows, which combined with access to the credit markets provides us with significant discretionary funding capacity. However, financial markets in the United States, Europe, and Asia have been experiencing extreme disruption in recent years, including, among other things, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others. While currently these conditions have not impaired our ability to operate our business, there can be no assurance that there will not be 14a further deterioration in financial markets and confidence in major economies, which could impact customer demand for our products, as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers, and creditors. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of a disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions and the effects they will have on our business and financial condition.Future terror attacks, war, natural disasters, or other events beyond our control could adversely impact our businesses.Despite our concerted effort to minimize risk to our production capabilities and corporate information systems and to reduce the effect of unforeseen interruptions to us through business continuity planning and disaster recovery plans, terrorist attacks, war, natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, pandemic diseases, or other events, such as strikes by a significant customer’s or supplier’s workforce, could adversely impact demand for or supply of our products and could also cause disruption to our facilities or systems, which could also interrupt operational processes and adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products and provide services and support to our customers. We operate facilities in areas of the world that are exposed to natural disasters, such as but not limited to hurricanes, floods, tornados, and pandemic diseases. Financial difficulties of our customers, delays by our customers in production of their products, high fuel prices, the concern of another major terrorist attack, and the overall decreased demand for our products could adversely affect our operating results and financial position.Intrusion on our systems could damage our business.We store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, and confidential employee information, on our servers and databases. Despite our implementation of firewalls, switchgear, and other network security measures, our servers, databases, and other systems may be vulnerable to computer hackers, physical or electronic break-ins, sabotage, computer viruses, worms, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. We continue to review and enhance our computer systems to try to prevent unauthorized and unlawful intrusions, but in the future it is possible that we may not be able to prevent all intrusions. Such intrusions could result in our network security or computer systems being compromised and possibly result in the misappropriation or corruption of sensitive information or cause disruptions in our services. We might be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against, remediate, or alleviate problems caused by such intrusions. Any such intrusion could cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subject us to legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.There are risks associated with owning our common stock.Like any equity security, our common stock is subject to a number of risks that may adversely impact our share price including: there is a limited trading market in our common stock; we may not in the future be able to pay dividends on our common stock; we may issue common stock for acquisitions or other purposes that could be dilutive to current stockholders; and we have various anti-takeover defenses such as our rights plan and our ability to issue preferred stock that may discourage a potential acquirer"
14,CW,CURTISS-WRIGHT CORP,2014-02-21,"Risk Factors
.We have summarized below the significant, known material risks to our business. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely impacted if any of these risks materialize. Additional risk factors not currently known to us or that we believe are immaterial may also impair our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The risk factors below should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as other required filings by us to the Securities Exchange Commission, such as our Form 10-Q’s, Form 8-K’s, proxy statements for our annual shareholder meetings, and subsequent amendments, if any.A substantial portion of our revenues and earnings depends upon the continued willingness of the U.S. Government and our other customers in the defense industry to buy our products and services.In 2013, approximately 30% of our revenues were derived from or related to defense programs.  U.S. defense spending has historically been cyclical, and defense budgets tend to rise when perceived threats to national security increase the level of concern over the country’s safety. At other times, spending by the military can decrease. Competing demands for federal funds can put pressure on all areas of discretionary spending, which could ultimately impact the defense budget. A decrease in U.S. Government defense spending or changes in spending allocation could result in one or more of our programs being reduced, delayed, or terminated. Reductions in defense industry spending may or may not have an adverse effect on programs for which we provide products and services. In the event expenditures are reduced for products we manufacture or services we provide and are not offset by revenues from foreign sales, new programs, or products or services that we currently manufacture or provide, we may experience a reduction in our revenues and earnings and a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations.We must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business. A violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties or the termination of our contracts or debarment from bidding on contracts. These fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards, receiving or paying kickbacks, or filing false claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies. The failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation. It could also result in our progress payments being withheld.In some instances, these laws and regulations impose terms or rights that are more favorable to the government than those typically available to commercial parties in negotiated transactions. For example, the U.S. Government may terminate any of our government contracts and, in general, subcontracts, at its convenience as well as for default based on performance. Upon termination for convenience of a fixed-price type contract, we normally are entitled to receive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement for allowable costs for work-in-process, and an allowance for profit on work actually completed on the contract or adjustment for loss if completion of performance would have resulted in a loss. Upon termination for convenience of a cost reimbursement contract, we normally are entitled to reimbursement of allowable costs plus a portion of the fee. Such allowable costs would normally include our cost to terminate agreements with our suppliers and subcontractors. The amount of the fee recovered, if any, is related to the portion of the work accomplished prior to termination and is determined by negotiation.A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. In addition, on those contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor, the U.S. Government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor, irrespective of the quality of our services as a subcontractor.In addition, our U.S. Government contracts typically span one or more base years and multiple option years. The U.S. Government generally has the right to not exercise option periods and may not exercise an option period if the agency is not satisfied with our performance on the contract or does not receive funding to continue the program. U.S. Government procurement may adversely affect our cash flow or program profitability.A significant reduction in the purchase of our products by the U.S. government could have a material adverse effect on our business. The risk that governmental purchases of our products may decline stems from the nature of our business with the U.S. government, where it may:•terminate, reduce, or modify contracts or subcontracts if its requirements or budgetary constraints change;•cancel multi-year contracts and related orders if funds become unavailable; and 14•shift its spending priorities.In addition, as a defense contractor, we are subject to risks in connection with government contracts, including without limitation:•the frequent need to bid on programs prior to completing the necessary design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and/or cost overruns;•the difficulty in forecasting long-term costs and schedules and the potential obsolescence of products related to long-term, fixed price contracts;•contracts with varying fixed terms that may not be renewed or followed by follow-on contracts upon expiration;•cancellation of the follow-on production phase of contracts if program requirements are not met in the development phase;•the failure of a prime contractor customer to perform on a contract;•the fact that government contract wins can be contested by other contractors; and•the inadvertent failure to comply with any the U.S. Government rules, laws and regulations, including the False Claims Act or the Arms Export Control Act.Sequestration and regulatory changes related to the U.S. Government Defense Budget could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.In January 2014, President Obama signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, an omnibus spending bill. The law provides $520.5 billion for defense and $491.7 billion for non-defense discretionary programs through September 30, 2014 and replaces what would have been the second round of across-the-board sequester cuts “sequestration” mandated by the 2011 Budget Control Act.  The act provides for modest sequester relief in FY14 and provides the DoD additional stability and flexibility to entertain multi-year contracts.  Despite these benefits, the DoD and contractors will still face significant challenges over the next decade as a result of sequestration.  While such reductions to future DoD spending levels are largely undetermined, any reduction in levels of DoD spending, cancellations or delays impacting existing contracts or programs, including through sequestration, could have a material impact on the Corporation’s results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.  The success of our growth strategy is dependent upon our ability to complete acquisitions and integrate acquired businesses.Our strategy includes both growth through core ""tuck-in"" acquisitions and organic growth. As a result, our future growth depends in part on our ability to implement our acquisition strategy and successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations. If we are unable to identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, obtain financing, and successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations, our growth strategy may not be successful. In addition, acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, technologies, and products of the acquired company, the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company, and the diversion of our management’s attention from other business concerns. This is the case particularly in the fiscal quarters immediately following the completion of an acquisition since the operations of the acquired business are integrated into the acquiring businesses’ operations during this period. We cannot be sure that we will accurately anticipate all of the changing demands that any future acquisition may impose on our management or on our operational, financial, and management information systems.  Once integrated, acquired operations may not achieve levels of revenue, profitability, or productivity comparable to those of our existing operations or may otherwise not perform as we expected. We may fail to discover liabilities relating to a pending acquisition during the due diligence investigation, liabilities for which we, as the successor owner, might be responsible. Although we seek to minimize the impact of potential undiscovered liabilities by structuring acquisitions to minimize liabilities and obtaining indemnities and warranties from the selling party, these methods may not fully protect us from the impact of undiscovered liabilities. For example, indemnities or warranties are often limited in scope, amount, and duration and may not fully cover the liabilities for which they were intended. If indemnities or warranties are limited, the liabilities that are not covered by the limited indemnities or warranties could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.15We use estimates when accounting for long-term contracts. Changes in estimates could affect our profitability and overall financial position.Long-term contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. For example, assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract as costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials. Similarly, assumptions have to be made regarding the future impact of efficiency initiatives and cost reduction efforts. Incentives, awards, price escalations, liquidated damages, or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance. It is possible that materially different amounts could be obtained, because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, if different assumptions were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances, or estimates may have a material adverse effect upon future period financial reporting and performance. See “Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies” in Part II, Item 7 of this form 10-K.If we fail to satisfy our contractual obligations our contracts may be terminated and we may incur significant costs or liabilities, including liquidated damages and penalties.In general, our contracts may be terminated for our failure to satisfy our contractual obligations. In addition, some of our contracts contain substantial liquidated damages provisions and financial penalties related to our failure to satisfy our contractual obligations. For example, the terms of the Electro-Mechanical divisions’ AP1000 China and AP1000 United States contracts with Westinghouse include liquidated damage penalty provisions for failure to meet contractual delivery dates if we caused the delay and the delay was not excusable.  On October 10, 2013, we received a letter from Westinghouse stating entitlements to the maximum amount of liquidated damages allowable under the AP1000 China contract of approximately $25 million.  To date, we have not met certain contractual delivery dates under the AP 1000 China contract; however there are significant uncertainties as to which parties are responsible for the delays, and we believe we have adequate legal defenses. Consequently, as a result of the above matters, we may incur significant costs or liabilities, including penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.Our backlog is subject to reduction and cancellation, which could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.Backlog represents products or services that our customers have committed by contract to purchase from us. Total backlog includes both funded (unfilled orders for which funding is authorized, appropriated, and contractually obligated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated and/or contractually obligated by the customer). The Corporation is a subcontractor to prime contractors for the vast majority of our government business; as such, substantially all amounts in backlog are funded. Backlog excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering type contracts (e.g. Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity). Backlog is adjusted for changes in foreign exchange rates and is reduced for contract cancellations and terminations in the period in which they occur. Backlog as of December 31, 2013 was $1,716 million. Backlog is subject to fluctuations and is not necessarily indicative of future sales. The U.S. government may unilaterally modify or cancel its contracts. In addition, under certain of our commercial contracts, our customers may unilaterally modify or terminate their orders at any time for their convenience. Accordingly, certain portions of our backlog can be cancelled or reduced at the option of the U.S. government and commercial customers. Our failure to replace cancelled or reduced backlog could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.Our future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairment charges.At December 31, 2013, we had goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of approximately $1,582 million, which represented approximately 46% of our total assets. Our goodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and is also tested whenever events and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. Any excess goodwill resulting from the impairment test must be written off in the period of determination. Intangible assets (other than goodwill) are generally amortized over the useful life of such assets. In addition, from time to time, we may acquire or make an investment in a business that will require us to record goodwill based on the purchase price and the value of the acquired assets. We may subsequently experience unforeseen issues with such business that adversely affect the anticipated returns of the business or value of the intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets for such business. Future determinations of significant write-offs of goodwill or intangible assets as a result of an impairment test or any accelerated amortization of other intangible assets could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.16We operate in highly competitive markets.We compete against companies that often have greater sales volumes and financial, research, human, and marketing resources than we have. In addition, some of our largest customers could develop the capability to manufacture products or provide services similar to products that we manufacture or services that we provide. This would result in these customers supplying their own products or services and competing directly with us for sales of these products or services, all of which could significantly reduce our revenues. Furthermore, we are facing increased international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition. Our management believes that the principal points of competition in our markets are technology, product quality, performance, price, technical expertise, and timeliness of delivery. If we are unable to compete successfully with existing or new competitors in these areas, our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, could be materially and adversely impacted.Our future growth and continued success is dependent upon our key personnel.Our success is dependent upon the efforts of our senior management personnel and our ability to attract and retain other highly qualified management and technical personnel. We face competition for management and qualified technical personnel from other companies and organizations. Therefore, we may not be able to retain our existing management and technical personnel or fill new management or technical positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover at our existing compensation levels. Although we have entered into change of control agreements with some members of senior management, we do not have employment contracts with our key executives. We have made a concerted effort to reduce the effect of the loss of our senior management personnel through management succession planning. The loss of members of our senior management and qualified technical personnel could have a material and adverse effect on our business.Our international operations are subject to risks and volatility.During 2013, approximately 29% of our consolidated revenue was from customers outside of the United States, and we have operating facilities in foreign countries. Doing business in foreign countries is subject to numerous risks, including without limitation: political and economic instability; the uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases; restrictive trade policies; and complying with foreign regulatory and tax requirements that are subject to change. While these factors or the impact of these factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations. To the extent that foreign sales are transacted in foreign currencies and we do not enter into currency hedge transactions, we are exposed to risk of losses due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly for the Canadian dollar, the Euro, Swiss franc, and the British pound. Significant fluctuations in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.We may be unable to protect the value of our intellectual property.Obtaining, maintaining, and enforcing our intellectual property rights and avoiding infringing on the intellectual property rights of others are important factors to the operation of our business. While we take precautionary steps to protect our technological advantages and intellectual property and rely in part on patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright laws, we cannot assure that the precautionary steps we have taken will completely protect our intellectual property rights. Because patent applications in the United States are maintained in secrecy until either the patent application is published or a patent is issued, we may not be aware of third-party patents, patent applications, and other intellectual property relevant to our products that may block our use of our intellectual property or may be used in third-party products that compete with our products and processes. When others infringe on our intellectual property rights, the value of our products is diminished, and we may incur substantial litigation costs to enforce our rights. Similarly, we may incur substantial litigation costs and the obligation to pay royalties if others claim we infringed on their intellectual property rights. When we develop intellectual property and technologies with funding from U.S. Government contracts, the government has the royalty-free right to use that property.In addition to our patent rights, we also rely on unpatented technology, trade secrets, and confidential information. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques or otherwise gain access to or disclose our technology. We may not be able to protect our rights in unpatented technology, trade secrets, and confidential information effectively. We require each of our employees and consultants to execute a confidentiality agreement at the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us. There is no guarantee that we will succeed in obtaining and retaining executed agreements from all employees or consultants. Moreover, these agreements may not provide effective protection of our information or, in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure, they may not provide adequate remedies.17Our operations are subject to numerous domestic and international laws, regulations, and restrictions, and noncompliance with these laws, regulations, and restrictions could expose us to fines, penalties, suspension, or debarment, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and overall financial condition.We have contracts and operations in many parts of the world subject to United States and foreign laws and regulations, including the False Claims Act, regulations relating to import-export control (including the International Traffic in Arms Regulation promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act), technology transfer restrictions, repatriation of earnings, exchange controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act, and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act. Although we have implemented policies and procedures and provided training that we believe are sufficient to address these risks, we cannot guarantee that our operations will always comply with these laws and regulations. Failure by us or our sales representatives or consultants to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities and could, in the extreme case, result in suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.We are subject to liability under environmental laws.Our business and facilities are subject to numerous federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to the use, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials and other waste products. Environmental laws generally impose liability for investigation, remediation, and removal of hazardous materials and other waste products on property owners and those who dispose of materials at waste sites, whether or not the waste was disposed of legally at the time in question. We are currently addressing environmental remediation at certain current and former facilities, and we have been named as a potentially responsible party along with other organizations in a number of environmental clean-up sites and may be named in connection with future sites. We are required to contribute to the costs of the investigation and remediation and to establish reserves in our financial statements for future costs deemed probable and estimable. Although we have estimated and reserved for future environmental remediation costs, the final resolution of these liabilities may significantly vary from our estimates and could potentially have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability.Our business operates in many locations under government jurisdictions that impose income taxes. Changes in domestic or foreign income tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or lower income tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain revenues or the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability. Corporate tax reform continues to be a priority in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. Changes to the tax system in the U.S. could have significant effects, positive or negative, on our effective tax rate and on our deferred tax assets and liabilities. In addition, audits by income tax authorities could result in unanticipated increases in our income tax expense.Our current debt, and debt we may incur in the future, could adversely affect our business and financial position.As of December 31, 2013, we had $960 million of debt outstanding, of which $959 million is long-term debt. Our level of debt could have significant consequences for our business including: requiring us to use our cash flow to pay the principal and interest on our debt, reducing funds available for acquisitions and other investments in our business; making us vulnerable to economic downturns and increases in interest rates; limiting us from obtaining additional debt; and impacting our ability to pay dividends.A percentage of our workforce is employed under collective bargaining agreements.Approximately 6% of our workforce is employed under collective bargaining agreements, which from time to time are subject to renewal and negotiation. We cannot ensure that we will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements, that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor, or that a breakdown in such negotiations will not result in the disruption of our operations. Although we have generally enjoyed good relations with both our unionized and non-unionized employees, if we are subject to labor actions, we may experience an adverse impact on our operating results.For example, on August 24, 2012, the Electronic Mechanical Division (EMD) of Curtiss Wright’s Flow Control segment experienced a strike at its Cheswick, Pennsylvania facility. The financial impacts of the strike were an $18 million and $6 million shift in revenue and operating income, respectively, from 2012 to 2013, due to the temporary suspension of work, and an additional $5 million unfavorable impact to operating income as a result of unrecoverable absorption of overhead costs.18Substantial defaults by our customers related to accounts receivable or the loss of significant customers could have a significant negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.A significant portion of our working capital consists of accounts receivable from customers. If customers responsible for a significant amount of accounts receivable were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay for products and services, or were to become unwilling or unable to make payments in a timely manner, our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity could be adversely affected. An economic or industry downturn could adversely and materially affect the servicing of these accounts receivable, which could result in longer payment cycles, increased collection costs, and defaults in excess of management’s expectations.Our earnings and margins depend in part on subcontractor performance, as well as raw material and component availability and pricing.Our businesses depend on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials and components. At times subcontractors perform services that we provide to our customers. We depend on these subcontractors and vendors to meet their contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements. Generally, raw materials and purchased components are available from a number of different suppliers, though several suppliers are our sole source of certain components. If a sole-source supplier should cease or otherwise be unable to deliver such components, our operating results could be adversely impacted. In addition, our supply networks can sometimes experience price fluctuations. Our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor may be adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers are unable to provide the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner. While we have attempted to mitigate the effects of increased costs through price increases, there are no assurances that higher prices can effectively be passed through to our customers or that we will be able to offset fully or on a timely basis the effects of higher raw materials costs through price increases.Our business involves risks associated with complex manufacturing processes.Our manufacturing processes depend on certain sophisticated and high-value equipment. Unexpected failures of this equipment may result in production delays, revenue loss, and significant repair costs. In addition, equipment failures could result in injuries to our employees. Moreover, the competitive nature of our businesses requires us to continuously implement process changes intended to achieve product improvements and manufacturing efficiencies. These process changes may at times result in production delays, quality concerns, and increased costs. Any disruption of operations at our facilities due to equipment failures or process interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business.The airline industry is heavily regulated, and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements, our results of operations could suffer.Governmental agencies throughout the world, including the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the European Aviation Safety Agency, prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components, including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although compliance with FAA requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries. We include, with the products that we sell to our aircraft manufacturing customers, documentation certifying that each part complies with applicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. In order to sell our products, we and the products we manufacture must also be certified by our individual OEM customers. If any of the material authorizations or approvals qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended, then the sale of the subject product would be prohibited by law, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.From time to time, the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations, which are usually more stringent than existing regulations. If these proposed regulations are adopted and enacted, we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop new technologies.Virtually all of the products produced and sold by us are highly engineered and require sophisticated manufacturing and system-integration techniques and capabilities. The commercial and government markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies. The product and program needs of our government and commercial customers change and evolve regularly. Accordingly, our future performance depends in part on our ability to identify emerging technological trends, develop and manufacture competitive products, and bring those products to market quickly at cost-effective prices.19Potential product liability risks exist from the products that we sell.We manufacture highly engineered products, and such products may contain design or manufacturing errors or defects, which may result in product liability claims against us. For example, in December 2013, we, along with other unaffiliated parties, received a claim from Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNRL) pertaining to a fire and explosion at a delayed coker unit at CNRL’s Fort McMurray refinery which resulted in the injury of five CNRL employees, damage to property and equipment, and various forms of consequential loss such as loss of profit, lost opportunities, and business interruption.  The fire and explosion occurred when a CNRL employee bypassed certain safety controls and opened an operating coker unit. The total quantum of alleged damages arising from the incident has not been finalized, but is estimated to meet or exceed $1 billion . We currently maintain what we believe to be suitable and adequate commercial, property and casualty, product liability, and other forms of insurance to cover this matter and other potential claims. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to maintain our insurance on acceptable terms or that such insurance will be provide adequate protection against these potential liabilities. In the event of a judgment against us on this matter or other claims against us, a lack of sufficient insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Moreover, even if we maintain adequate insurance, any successful claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, and on the ability to obtain suitable or adequate insurance. Increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.Our earnings may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of income or expense we record for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. U.S. GAAP requires that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions relating to financial market and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can change the assumptions. The most significant year-end assumptions used to estimate pension or other postretirement benefit expense for the following year are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, expected future medical cost inflation, and expected compensation increases. In addition, we are required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant change to equity through a reduction or increase to other comprehensive income. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement benefit plans accounting policies, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies—Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.  Although U.S. GAAP expense and pension or other postretirement contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect U.S. GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash the company would contribute to the pension or other postretirement plans. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law, Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and discretionary contributions to improve the plans’ funded status. An obligation to make contributions to pension plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses.Our operating results and financial condition may be adversely impacted by the current worldwide economic conditions.We currently generate significant operating cash flows, which combined with access to the credit markets provides us with significant discretionary funding capacity. However, financial markets in the United States, Europe, and Asia have been experiencing extreme disruption in recent years, including, among other things, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others. While currently these conditions have not impaired our ability to operate our business, there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets and confidence in major economies, which could impact customer demand for our products, as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers, and creditors. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of a disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions and the effects they will have on our business and financial condition.Future terror attacks, war, natural disasters, or other events beyond our control could adversely impact our businesses.Despite our concerted effort to minimize risk to our production capabilities and corporate information systems and to reduce the effect of unforeseen interruptions to us through business continuity planning and disaster recovery plans, terrorist attacks, war, natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, tornados, pandemic diseases, or other events, such as strikes by a significant customer’s or supplier’s workforce, could adversely impact demand for or supply of our products and could also cause disruption to our facilities or systems, which could also interrupt operational processes and adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products and provide services and support to our customers. We operate facilities in areas of the world that are exposed to natural disasters, such as but not limited to hurricanes, floods, tornados, and pandemic diseases. Financial difficulties of our customers, delays by our customers in production of their products, high fuel prices, the concern of another major terrorist attack, and the overall decreased demand for our products could adversely affect our operating results and financial position.20Intrusion on our systems could damage our business.We store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, and confidential employee information, on our servers and databases. Despite our implementation of firewalls, switchgear, and other network security measures, our servers, databases, and other systems may be vulnerable to computer hackers, physical or electronic break-ins, sabotage, computer viruses, worms, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. We continue to review and enhance our computer systems to try to prevent unauthorized and unlawful intrusions, but in the future it is possible that we may not be able to prevent all intrusions. Such intrusions could result in our network security or computer systems being compromised and possibly result in the misappropriation or corruption of sensitive information or cause disruptions in our services. We might be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against, remediate, or alleviate problems caused by such intrusions. Any such intrusion could cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subject us to legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.There are risks associated with owning our common stock.Like any equity security, our common stock is subject to a number of risks that may adversely impact our share price including: there is a limited trading market in our common stock; we may not in the future be able to pay dividends on our common stock; we may issue common stock for acquisitions or other purposes that could be dilutive to current stockholders; and we have various anti-takeover defenses such as our rights plan and our ability to issue preferred stock that may discourage a potential acquirer"
3,CW,CURTISS-WRIGHT CORP,2012-02-24,"Risk Factors
.We have summarized below the significant, known material risks to our business. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely impacted if any of these risks materialize. Additional risk factors not currently known to us or that we believe are immaterial may also impair  our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The risk factors below should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as other required18filings by us to the Securities Exchange Commission, such as our Form 10-Qs, Form 8-Ks, proxy statements for our annual shareholder meetings, and subsequent amendments, if any.A substantial portion of our revenues and earnings depends upon the continued willingness of the U.S. Government and our other customers in the defense industry to buy our products and services. In 2011, approximately 40% of our revenues were derived from or related to defense programs, with approximately 16% attributable to U.S. Navy procurements. U.S. defense spending has historically been cyclical, and defense budgets tend to rise when perceived threats to national security increase the level of concern over the  countrys safety. At other times, spending by the military can decrease. While Department of Defense funding has grown rapidly over the past few years, the top-line DoD budget is expected to flatten or potentially decline over the next several years. Competing demands for federal funds can put pressure on all areas of discretionary  spending, which could ultimately impact the defense budget. A decrease in U.S. Government defense spending or changes in spending allocation could result in one or more of our programs being reduced, delayed, or terminated. Reductions in defense industry spending may or may not have an adverse effect on programs for which we  provide products and services. In the event expenditures are reduced for products we manufacture or services we provide and are not offset by revenues from foreign sales, new programs, or products or services that we currently manufacture or provide, we may experience a reduction in our revenues and earnings and a material adverse  effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, there can be no assurance that our significant customers will continue to buy our products and services at current or increased levels.As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations.We must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business. A violation of specific laws and  regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties or the termination of our contracts or debarment from bidding on contracts. These fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards,  receiving or paying kickbacks, or filing false claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies. The failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation. It could also result in our progress payments being withheld.In some instances, these laws and regulations impose terms or rights that are more favorable to the government than those typically available to commercial parties in negotiated transactions. For example, the U.S. Government may terminate any of our government contracts and, in general, subcontracts, at its convenience as well as  for default based on performance. Upon termination for convenience of a fixed-price type contract, we normally are entitled to receive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement for allowable costs for work-in-process, and an allowance for profit on work actually completed on the contract or adjustment for loss if completion  of performance would have resulted in a loss. Upon termination for convenience of a cost reimbursement contract, we normally are entitled to reimbursement of allowable costs plus a portion of the fee. Such allowable costs would normally include our cost to terminate agreements with our suppliers and subcontractors. The amount of the  fee recovered, if any, is related to the portion of the work accomplished prior to termination and is determined by negotiation.A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. In addition, on those contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor, the U.S. Government could terminate a prime contract under which we  are a subcontractor, irrespective of the quality of our services as a subcontractor.In addition, our U.S. Government contracts typically span one or more base years and multiple option years. The U.S. Government generally has the right to not exercise option periods and may not exercise an option period if the agency is not satisfied with our performance on the contract or does not receive funding to continue the  program. U.S. Government procurement may adversely affect our cash flow or program profitability.19A significant reduction in the purchase of our products by the U.S. government would have a material adverse effect on our business. The risk that governmental purchases of our products may decline stems from the nature of our business with the U.S. government, where it may:                terminate, reduce, or modify contracts or subcontracts if its requirements or budgetary constraints change;    cancel multi-year contracts and related orders if funds become unavailable; and    shift its spending priorities.In addition, as a defense contractor, we are subject to risks in connection with government contracts, including without limitation:                the frequent need to bid on programs prior to completing the necessary design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and/or cost overruns;    the difficulty in forecasting long-term costs and schedules and the potential obsolescence of products related to long-term, fixed price contracts;    contracts with varying fixed terms that may not be renewed or followed by follow-on contracts upon expiration;    cancellation of the follow-on production phase of contracts if program requirements are not met in the development phase;    the failure of a prime contractor customer to perform on a contract; and    the fact that government contract wins can be contested by other contractors.Our business could be adversely affected by a negative audit by the U.S. Government.We operate in a highly regulated environment and have been, and expect to continue to be, routinely audited by the U.S. Government and others. On a regular basis, we monitor our policies and procedures with respect to our contracts to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions and to assess compliance with  all applicable government regulations. Negative audit findings could result in termination of a contract, forfeiture of profits, or suspension of payments. From time to time, we are subject to U.S. Government investigations relating to our operations. Government contractors that are found to have violated the law, such as the False Claims  Act or the Arms Export Control Act, or are indicted or convicted for violations of other federal laws, or are found not to have acted responsibly as defined by the law, may be subject to significant fines. Such convictions could also result in suspension or debarment from government contracting for some period of time. Given our  dependence on government contracting, suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our operating results are subject to fluctuations.Our business is subject to changes in economic cycles and fluctuations in the timing of government procurement activities. As a result, our annual and quarterly operating results may fluctuate. It is possible that our operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors. Similarly, securities analysts may  issue reports downgrading our common stock. These events could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.The success of our growth strategy is dependent upon our ability to complete acquisitions and integrate acquired businesses.Our strategy includes growth through acquisitions. As a result, our future growth depends in part on our ability to implement our acquisition strategy and successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations. If we are unable to identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, obtain financing, and  successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations, our growth strategy may not be successful. In addition, acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, technologies, services, and products of the acquired company, the potential loss of key employees of the acquired  company, and the diversion of our managements attention from other business concerns. This is the case particularly in the fiscal quarters immediately following the completion of an acquisition since the operations of the acquired business are integrated into the acquiring businesses operations20during this period. We cannot be sure that we will accurately anticipate all of the changing demands that any future acquisition may impose on our management, our operational and management information systems, and our financial systems. Once integrated, acquired operations may not achieve levels of revenue, profitability, or  productivity comparable to those of our existing operations or may otherwise not perform as we expected. We may fail to discover liabilities relating to a pending acquisition during the due diligence investigation, liabilities for which we, as the successor owner, might be responsible. Although we seek to minimize the impact of potential  undiscovered liabilities by structuring acquisitions to minimize liabilities and obtaining indemnities and warranties from the selling party, these methods may not fully protect us from the impact of undiscovered liabilities. For example, indemnities or warranties are often limited in scope, amount, or duration, and may not fully cover the  liabilities for which they were intended. If indemnities or warranties are limited, the liabilities that are not covered by the limited indemnities or warranties could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.We use estimates when accounting for long-term contracts. Changes in estimates could affect our profitability and overall financial position.Long-term contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. For  example, assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract as costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials. Similarly, assumptions have to be made regarding the future impact of efficiency initiatives and cost reduction efforts. Incentives, awards, price escalations, or penalties  related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance. It is possible that materially different amounts could be obtained, because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, if  different assumptions were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances, or estimates may have a material adverse effect upon future period financial reporting and performance. See Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies in Part II, Item 7.If we fail to satisfy our contractual obligations or meet performance standards, our contracts may be terminated and we may incur significant costs or liabilities, including liquidated damages and penalties.In general, our contracts may be terminated for our failure to satisfy our contractual obligations or to meet performance standards. In addition, some of our contracts contain substantial liquidated damages provisions and financial penalties related to our failure to satisfy our contractual obligations or performance failures.  Consequently, as a result of the above matters, we may incur significant costs or liabilities, including penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of our operation.Our earnings and margins may vary based on the mix of our contracts and programs.At December 31, 2011, our backlog included both cost reimbursable and fixed-price contracts. Cost reimbursable contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixed-price contracts. Production contracts are mainly fixed-price contracts, and developmental contracts are generally cost reimbursable contracts. Our earnings and  margins may vary materially depending on the types of long-term government and commercial contracts undertaken, the nature of the products produced or services performed under those contracts, the costs incurred in performing the work, the achievement of other performance objectives, and the stage of performance at which the right  to receive fees, particularly under incentive and award fee contracts, is finally determined.Under fixed-price contracts, we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and, consequently, any costs in excess of the fixed price are generally absorbed by us. Under time-and-materials contracts, we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses. Under cost-reimbursable contracts,  subject to a contract-ceiling amount in certain cases, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee, which may be fixed or performance based. However, if our costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or applicable regulations, we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all such  costs and may have our fees reduced or eliminated. The failure to perform to customer expectations and contract requirements can result in reduced fees and may affect our financial performance for the affected period. Under each type of contract, if we are unable to control costs we incur in21performing under the contract, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. Cost over-runs also may adversely affect our ability to sustain existing programs and obtain future contract awards.Our backlog is subject to reduction and cancellation, which could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.Backlog represents products or services that our customers have committed by contract to purchase from us. Total backlog includes both funded (unfilled orders for which funding is authorized, appropriated and contractually obligated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated  and/or contractually obligated by the customer). The Corporation is a subcontractor to prime contractors for the vast majority of our government business; as such, substantially all amounts in backlog are funded. Backlog excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering type contracts (e.g. Indefinite Delivery /  Indefinite Quantity). Backlog is adjusted for changes in foreign exchange rates and is reduced for contract cancellations and terminations in the period in which they occur. Backlog as of December 31, 2011 was $1.7 billion. Backlog is subject to fluctuations and is not necessarily indicative of future sales. The U.S. government may  unilaterally modify or cancel its contracts. In addition, under certain of our commercial contracts, our customers may unilaterally modify or terminate their orders at any time for their convenience. Accordingly, certain portions of our backlog can be cancelled or reduced at the option of the U.S. government and commercial customers. Our  failure to replace cancelled or reduced backlog could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.Our future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairment charges.At December 31, 2011, we had goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately $1 billion, net of accumulated amortization, which represented approximately 40% of our total assets. Our goodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and is also tested whenever events and circumstances indicate that goodwill may  be impaired. Any excess goodwill resulting from the impairment test must be written off in the period of determination. Intangible assets (other than goodwill) are generally amortized over the useful life of such assets. In addition, from time to time, we may acquire or make an investment in a business that will require us to record  goodwill based on the purchase price and the value of the acquired assets. We may subsequently experience unforeseen issues with such business that adversely affect the anticipated returns of the business or value of the intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets for such  business. Future determinations of significant write-offs of goodwill or intangible assets as a result of an impairment test or any accelerated amortization of other intangible assets could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.We operate in highly competitive markets.We compete against companies that often have greater sales volumes and financial, research, human, and marketing resources than we have. In addition, some of our largest customers could develop the capability to manufacture products or provide services similar to products that we manufacture or services that we provide. This  would result in these customers supplying their own products or services and competing directly with us for sales of these products or services, all of which could significantly reduce our revenues. Furthermore, we are facing increased international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition. Our management believes that  the principal points of competition in our markets are technology, product quality, performance, price, service, previous installation history, technical expertise, and timeliness of delivery. If we are unable to compete successfully with existing or new competitors in these areas, our business, financial condition, and results of operations  could be materially and adversely impacted.Our future growth and continued success is dependent upon our key personnel.Our success is dependent upon the efforts of our senior management personnel and our ability to attract and retain other highly qualified management and technical personnel. We face competition for management and qualified technical personnel from other companies and organizations. Therefore, we may not be able to retain our  existing management and technical personnel or fill new management or technical positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover at our existing compensation levels. Although we have entered into change of control agreements with some members of senior management, we do not have employment22contracts with our key executives. We have made a concerted effort to reduce the effect of the loss of our senior management personnel through management succession planning. The loss of members of our senior management and qualified technical personnel could have a material and adverse effect on our business.Our international operations are subject to risks and volatility.During 2011, approximately 30% of our consolidated revenue was from customers outside of the United States, and we have operating facilities in foreign countries. Doing business in foreign countries is subject to numerous risks, including without limitation: political and economic instability; the uncertainty of the ability of non-  U.S. customers to finance purchases; restrictive trade policies; and complying with foreign regulatory and tax requirements that are subject to change. While these factors or the impact of these factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations. To the extent that foreign sales are  transacted in foreign currencies and we do not enter into currency hedge transactions, we are exposed to risk of losses due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly for the Canadian dollar, the Euro, Swiss franc, and the British pound. Significant fluctuations in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we  do business could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.We may be unable to protect the value of our intellectual property.Obtaining, maintaining, and enforcing our intellectual property rights and avoiding infringing on the intellectual property rights of others are important factors to the operation of our business. While we take precautionary steps to protect our technological advantages and intellectual property and rely in part on patent, trademark, trade  secret, and copyright laws, we cannot assure that the precautionary steps we have taken will completely protect our intellectual property rights. Because patent applications in the United States are maintained in secrecy until either the patent application is published or a patent is issued, we may not be aware of third-party patents, patent  applications, and other intellectual property relevant to our products that may block our use of our intellectual property or may be used in third-party products that compete with our products and processes. When others infringe on our intellectual property rights, the value of our products is diminished, and we may incur substantial  litigation costs to enforce our rights. Similarly, we may incur substantial litigation costs and the obligation to pay royalties if others claim we infringed on their intellectual property rights. When we develop intellectual property and technologies with funding from U.S. Government contracts, the government has the royalty-free right to use  that property.In addition to our patent rights, we also rely on unpatented technology, trade secrets, and confidential information. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques or otherwise gain access to or disclose our technology. We may not be able to protect our rights in unpatented technology, trade  secrets, and confidential information effectively. We require each of our employees and consultants to execute a confidentiality agreement at the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us. There is no guarantee that we will succeed in obtaining and retaining executed agreements from all employees or  consultants. Moreover, these agreements may not provide effective protection of our information or, in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure, they may not provide adequate remedies.Our operations are subject to numerous domestic and international laws, regulations, and restrictions, and noncompliance with these laws, regulations, and restrictions could expose us to fines, penalties, suspension, or debarment, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and overall financial condition.We have contracts and operations in many parts of the world subject to United States and foreign laws and regulations, including the False Claims Act, regulations relating to import-export control (including the International Traffic in Arms Regulation promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act), technology transfer  restrictions, repatriation of earnings, exchange controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act, and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act. Although we have implemented policies and procedures and provided training that we believe are sufficient to address these risks, we cannot  guarantee that our operations will never fail to comply with these laws and regulations. Failure by us or our sales representatives or consultants to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities and could, in the extreme case, result in suspension or debarment23from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.We are subject to liability under environmental laws.Our business and facilities are subject to numerous federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to the use, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials and other waste products. Environmental laws generally impose liability for investigation, remediation, and removal of hazardous materials  and other waste products on property owners and those who dispose of materials at waste sites, whether or not the waste was disposed of legally at the time in question. We are currently addressing environmental remediation at certain current and former facilities, and we have been named as a potentially responsible party along with  other organizations in a number of environmental clean-up sites and may be named in connection with future sites. We are required to contribute to the costs of the investigation and remediation and to establish reserves in our financial statements for future costs deemed probable and estimable. Although we have estimated and reserved  for future environmental remediation costs, the final resolution of these liabilities may significantly vary from our estimates and could potentially have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability. Our business operates in many locations under government jurisdictions that impose income taxes. Changes in domestic or foreign income tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or lower income tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain revenues or the deductibility of certain expenses,  thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability. In addition, audits by income tax authorities could result in unanticipated increases in our income tax expense.Our current debt, and debt we may incur in the future, could adversely affect our business and financial position.As of December 31, 2011, we had $586 million of debt outstanding, of which $584 million is long-term debt. Our debt consists primarily of principal payable under our fixed rate senior notes. Our level of debt could have significant consequences for our business including: requiring us to use our cash flow to pay principal and  interest on our debt, reducing funds available for acquisitions and other investments in our business; making us vulnerable to economic downturns and increases in interest rates; limiting us from obtaining additional debt; and impacting our ability to pay dividends.A percentage of our workforce is employed under collective bargaining agreements.Approximately 7% of our workforce is employed under collective bargaining agreements, which from time to time are subject to renewal and negotiation. We cannot ensure that we will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements, that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor,  or that a breakdown in such negotiations will not result in the disruption of our operations. Although we have generally enjoyed good relations with both our unionized and non-unionized employees, if we are subject to labor actions, we may experience an adverse impact on our operating results.Substantial defaults by our customers related to accounts receivable or the loss of significant customers could have a significant negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.A significant portion of our working capital consists of accounts receivable from customers. If customers responsible for a significant amount of accounts receivable were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay for products and services, or were to become unwilling or unable to make payments in a timely manner, our  business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity could be adversely affected. An economic or industry downturn could adversely and materially affect the servicing of these accounts receivable, which could result in longer payment cycles, increased collection costs, and defaults in excess of managements expectations.24We rely on certain suppliers as a sole source of components for some of our products.Our manufacturing processes for our products often consist of the assembly of purchased components that are generally available from a number of different suppliers, though several suppliers are our sole source of certain components. If a sole-source supplier should cease or otherwise be unable to deliver such components, our  operating results could be adversely impacted. In addition, if our suppliers are unable to keep up with our demand for purchased components and we are unable to locate additional sources of supply, our operating results could be adversely impacted.Our earnings and margins depend in part on subcontractor performance, as well as raw material and component availability and pricing.Our businesses depend on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials and components. At times subcontractors perform services that we provide to our customers. We depend on these subcontractors and vendors to meet their contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements. These supply networks can  sometimes experience price fluctuations. Our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor may be adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers are unable to provide the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner. While we have attempted to mitigate the effects of  increased costs through price increases, there are no assurances that higher prices can effectively be passed through to our customers or that we will be able to offset fully or on a timely basis the effects of higher raw materials costs through price increases.Our business involves risks associated with complex manufacturing processes.Our manufacturing processes depend on certain sophisticated and high-value equipment. Unexpected failures of this equipment may result in production delays, revenue loss, and significant repair costs. In addition, equipment failures could result in injuries to our employees. Moreover, the competitive nature of our businesses  requires us to continuously implement process changes intended to achieve product improvements and manufacturing efficiencies. These process changes may at times result in production delays, quality concerns, and increased costs. Any disruption of operations at our facilities due to equipment failures or process interruptions could  have a material adverse effect on our business.The airline industry is heavily regulated, and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements, our results of operations could suffer.Governmental agencies throughout the world, including the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the European Aviation Safety Agency, prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components, including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products. Specific regulations vary from  country to country, although compliance with FAA requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries. We include, with the products that we sell to our aircraft manufacturing customers, documentation certifying that each part complies with applicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of  airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. In order to sell our products, we and the products we manufacture must also be certified by our individual OEM customers. If any of the material authorizations or approvals qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended, then the  sale of the subject product would be prohibited by law, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.From time to time, the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations, which are usually more stringent than existing regulations. If these proposed regulations are adopted and enacted, we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance, which could  have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop new technologies.Virtually all of the products produced and sold by us are highly engineered and require sophisticated manufacturing and system-integration techniques and capabilities. The commercial and government markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies. The product and program needs of our government  and commercial customers change and evolve regularly. Accordingly, our future performance depends in part on our ability to identify emerging technological trends, develop and manufacture competitive products, and bring those products to market quickly at cost-effective prices.25Potential product liability risks exist from the products that we sell.Our businesses expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, and sale of our products and the products of third-party vendors that we use or resell. We currently maintain what we believe to be suitable and adequate product liability insurance. There can be no assurance, however, that we  will be able to maintain our product liability insurance on acceptable terms or that our product liability insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities. In the event of a claim against us, a lack of sufficient insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of  operations. Moreover, even if we maintain adequate insurance, any successful claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and on the ability to obtain suitable or adequate insurance.Increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.Our earnings may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of income or expense we record for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. U.S. GAAP requires that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions relating to financial market and other  economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can change the assumptions. The most significant year-end assumptions used to estimate pension or other postretirement benefit expense for the following year are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, expected future medical cost inflation, and  expected compensation increases. In addition, we are required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant change to equity through a reduction or increase to other comprehensive income. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and other  postretirement benefit plans accounting policies, see Managements Discussion and AnalysisCritical Accounting Estimates and PoliciesPension and Other Postretirement Benefits in Part II, Item 7. Although U.S. GAAP expense and pension or other postretirement contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect  U.S. GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash the company would contribute to the pension or other postretirement plans. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law, Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and discretionary contributions to improve the plans funded  status. An obligation to make contributions to pension plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses.Our operating results and financial condition may be adversely impacted by the current worldwide economic conditions.We currently generate significant operating cash flows, which combined with access to the credit markets provides us with significant discretionary funding capacity. However, financial markets in the United States, Europe, and Asia have been experiencing extreme disruption in recent years, including, among other things, extreme  volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others. While currently these conditions have not impaired our ability to operate our business, there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets and  confidence in major economies, which could impact consumer and customer demand for our products, as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers, and creditors. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruption in financial markets and adverse economic  conditions, and the effects they will have on our business and financial condition.Future terror attacks, war, natural disasters, or other events beyond our control could adversely impact our businesses.Despite our concerted effort to minimize risk to our production capabilities and corporate information systems and to reduce the effect of unforeseen interruptions to us through business continuity planning and disaster recovery plans, terrorist attacks, war, natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, tornados, pandemic diseases, or  other events such as strikes by a significant customers or suppliers workforce could adversely impact demand for or supply of our products and could also cause disruption to our facilities or systems which could also interrupt operational processes and adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products and provide services and  support to our customers. We operate facilities in areas of the world that are exposed to26natural disasters, such as but not limited to hurricanes, floods, tornados, and pandemic diseases. For example, Hurricanes Ike and Gustav in 2008 caused disruption to the oil and gas market for our products and services. Similarly, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and subsequent terrorist attacks worldwide caused decreased  demand in the commercial aerospace market for our products and commercial overhaul and repair services. Financial difficulties of our customers, delays by our customers in production of their products, high fuel prices, the concern of another major terrorist attack, and the overall decreased demand for our customers products could  adversely affect our operating results and financial position.Intrusion on our systems could damage our business.We store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, and confidential employee information, in our servers and on our databases. Despite our implementation of firewalls, switchgear, and other network security measures, our servers, databases, and other systems may be vulnerable to computer  hackers, physical or electronic break-ins, sabotage, computer viruses, worms and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. We will continue to review and enhance our computer systems to try to prevent unauthorized and unlawful intrusions, but in the future it is possible that we may not be able to  prevent all intrusions and such intrusions could result in our network security or computer systems being compromised and possibly result in the misappropriation or corruption of sensitive information or cause disruptions in our services. We might be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against, remediate or  alleviate problems caused by such intrusions. Any such intrusion could cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subject us to legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, any of which could have a material adverse effect  on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.There are risks associated with owning our common stock.Like any equity security, our common stock is subject to a number of risks that may adversely impact our share price including: there is a limited trading market in our common stock; we may not in the future be able to pay dividends on our common stock; we may issue common stock for acquisitions or other purposes that could be  dilutive to current stockholders; and we have various anti-takeover defenses such as our rights plan and our ability to issue preferred stock that may discourage a potential acquirer"

. We havesummarized below the significant, known material risks to our business. Ourbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows couldbe materially and adversely impacted if any of these risks materialize.Additional risk factors not currently known to us or that we believe areimmaterial may also impair our business, financial condition, and results ofoperations. The risk factors below should be considered together withinformation included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well asother required filings by us to the Securities Exchange Commission, such as ourForm 10-Qs, Form 8-Ks, proxy statements for our annual shareholder meetings,and subsequent amendments, if any. A substantial portion of our revenues and earnings depends upon thecontinued willingness of the U.S. Government and our other customers in thedefense industry to buy our products and services. In 2009,approximately 42% of our revenues were derived from or related to defenseprograms, with approximately 15% attributable to U.S. Navy procurements. U.S.defense spending has historically been cyclical, and defense budgets tend torise when perceived threats to national security increase the level of concernover the countrys safety. At other times, spending by the military candecrease. While Department of Defense funding has grown rapidly over the pastfew years, there is no assurance this trend will continue. Competing demandsfor federal funds can put pressure on all areas of discretionary spending,which could ultimately impact the defense budget. A decrease in U.S. governmentdefense spending or changes in spending allocation could result in one or moreof our programs being reduced, delayed, or terminated. Reductions in defenseindustry spending may or may not have an adverse effect on programs for whichwe provide products and services. In the event expenditures are reduced for productswe manufacture or services we provide and are not offset by revenues fromforeign sales, new programs, or products or services that we currentlymanufacture or provide, we may experience a reduction in our revenues andearnings and a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,and results of operations. Further, there can be no assurance that oursignificant customers will continue to buy our products and services at currentor increased levels. As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to a number ofprocurement rules and regulations.We must complywith and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award,administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Governmentcontract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and,in some instances, impose added costs on our business. A violation of specificlaws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties orthe termination of our contracts or debarment from bidding on contracts. Thesefines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurementintegrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwisefailing to follow cost accounting standards, receiving or paying kickbacks, or filingfalse claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to auditsand investigations by government agencies. The failure to comply with the termsof our government contracts could harm our business reputation. It could alsoresult in our progress payments being withheld. In someinstances, these laws and regulations impose terms or rights that are morefavorable to the government than those typically available to commercialparties in negotiated transactions. For example, the U.S. Government mayterminate any of our government contracts and, in general, subcontracts, at itsconvenience as well as for default based on performance. Upon termination forconvenience of a fixed-price type contract, we normally are entitled to receivethe purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement for allowable costs forwork-in-process, and an allowance for profit on work actually completed on thecontract or adjustment for loss if completion of performance would haveresulted in a loss. Upon termination for convenience of a cost reimbursementcontract, Page 17we normallyare entitled to reimbursement of allowable costs plus a portion of the fee.Such allowable costs would normally include our cost to terminate agreementswith our suppliers and subcontractors. The amount of the fee recovered, if any,is related to the portion of the work accomplished prior to termination and isdetermined by negotiation. A terminationarising out of our default could expose us to liability and have a materialadverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. Inaddition, on those contracts for which we are teamed with others and are notthe prime contractor, the U.S. Government could terminate a prime contractunder which we are a subcontractor, irrespective of the quality of our servicesas a subcontractor. In addition,our U.S. Government contracts typically span one or more base years andmultiple option years. The U.S. Government generally has the right to notexercise option periods and may not exercise an option period if the agency isnot satisfied with our performance on the contract. U.S. Government Procurementmay adversely affect our cash flow or program profitability. A significantreduction in the purchase of our products by the U.S. government would have amaterial adverse effect on our business. The risk that governmental purchasesof our products may decline stems from the nature of our business with the U.S.government, where they may:     terminate, reduce or modify contracts or subcontracts if its requirements or budgetary constraints change;      cancel multi-year contracts and related orders if funds become unavailable; and     shift its spending priorities. In addition,as a defense contractor, we are subject to risks in connection with governmentcontracts, including without limitation:     the frequent need to bid on programs prior to completing the necessary design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and/or cost overruns;      the difficulty in forecasting long-term costs and schedules and the potential obsolescence of products related to long-term, fixed price contracts;      Contracts with varying fixed terms that may not be renewed or followed by follow-on contracts upon expiration;      cancellation of the follow-on production phase of contracts if program requirements are not met in the development phase;     the failure of a prime contractor customer to perform on a contract; and      the fact that government contract wins can be contested by other contractors. Our business could be adversely affected by a negative audit by theU.S. Government. We operate ina highly regulated environment and have been, and expect to continue to be,routinely audited by the U.S. Government and others. On a regular basis, wemonitor our policies and procedures with respect to our contracts to ensureconsistent application under similar terms and conditions and to assesscompliance with all applicable government regulations. Negative audit findingscould result in termination of a contract, forfeiture of profits, or suspensionof payments. From time to time we are subject to U.S. Government investigationsrelating to our operations. Government contractors that are found to haveviolated the law, such as the False Claims Act or the Arms Export Control Act,or are indicted or convicted for violations of other federal laws, or are foundnot to have acted responsibly as defined by the law, may be subject tosignificant fines. Such convictions could also result in suspension ordebarment from government contracting for some period of time. Given ourdependence on government contracting, suspension or debarment could have amaterial adverse effect on our business. Page 18Our operating results are subject to fluctuations.Our businessis subject to changes in economic cycles and fluctuation in the timing ofgovernment procurement activities. As a result, our annual and quarterlyoperating results may fluctuate. It is possible that our operating results fora particular quarter may not meet the expectations of securities analysts orinvestors. Similarly, securities analysts may issue reports downgrading ourcommon stock. These events could cause the market price of our common stock todecline. Future terror attacks, war, natural disasters, or other events beyondour control could adversely impact our businesses.Despite ourconcerted effort to minimize risk to our production capabilities and corporateinformation systems and to reduce the effect of unforeseen interruptions to usthrough business continuity planning and disaster recovery plans, terroristattacks, war, natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, tornados, pandemicdiseases, or other events such as strikes by a significant customers orsuppliers workforce could adversely impact demand for or supply of ourproducts and could also cause disruption to our facilities or systems whichcould also interrupt operational processes and adversely impact our ability tomanufacture our products and provide services and support to our customers. Weoperate facilities in areas of the world that are exposed to natural disasters,such as but not limited to hurricanes, floods, tornados, and pandemic diseases.For example, Hurricanes Ike and Gustav in 2008 caused disruption to the oil andgas market for our products and services. Similarly, the terrorist attacks ofSeptember 11, 2001 and subsequent terrorist attacks worldwide caused decreaseddemand in the commercial aerospace market for our products and commercialoverhaul and repair services. Financial difficulties of our customers, delaysby our customers in production of their products, high fuel prices, the concernof another major terrorist attack, and the overall decreased demand for ourcustomers products could adversely affect our operating results and financialposition. The success of our growth strategy is dependent upon our ability tocomplete acquisitions and integrate acquired businesses.Our strategyincludes growth through acquisitions. As a result, our future growth depends inpart on our ability to implement our acquisition strategy and successfullyintegrate acquired businesses into our existing operations. If we are unable toidentify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, obtainfinancing, and successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existingoperations, our growth strategy may not be successful. In addition,acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilationof the operations, technologies, services, and products of the acquiredcompany, the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company, and thediversion of our managements attention from other business concerns. This isthe case particularly in the fiscal quarters immediately following thecompletion of an acquisition because the operations of the acquired businessare integrated into the acquiring businesses operations during this period. Wecannot be sure that we will accurately anticipate all of the changing demandsthat any future acquisition may impose on our management, our operational andmanagement information systems, and our financial systems. Once integrated,acquired operations may not achieve levels of revenue, profitability, orproductivity comparable to those of our existing operations or may otherwisenot perform as we expected. We may fail to discover liabilities relating to apending acquisition during the due diligence investigation, liabilities forwhich we, as the successor owner, might be responsible. Although we seek tominimize the impact of potential undiscovered liabilities by structuringacquisitions to minimize liabilities and obtaining indemnities and warrantiesfrom the selling party, these methods may not fully protect us from the impactof undiscovered liabilities. For example, indemnities or warranties are oftenlimited in scope, amount, or duration, and may not fully cover the liabilitiesfor which they were intended. If indemnities or warranties are limited, theliabilities that are not covered by the limited indemnities or warranties couldhave a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We use estimates when accounting for contracts. Changes in estimatescould affect our profitability and overall financial position. Long-termcontract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimatingcontract revenues and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technicalissues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation oftotal revenues and costs at completion is complicated and subject to manyvariables. For example, assumptions have to be made regarding the length oftime to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases inwages and prices for materials. Similarly, assumptions have to be maderegarding the future impact of efficiency initiatives and cost reductionefforts. Incentives, awards, pricePage 19escalations,or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimatingrevenue and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient informationto assess anticipated performance. Because of the significance of the judgmentsand estimation processes described above, it is possible that materially differentamounts could be obtained if different assumptions were used or if theunderlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions,circumstances, or estimates may have a material adverse effect upon futureperiod financial reporting and performance. See Critical Accounting Estimatesand Policies in Part II, Item 7. New accounting standards could result in changes to our methods ofquantifying and recording accounting transactions, and could affect ourfinancial results and financial position. Changes toGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (GAAP)arise from new and revised standards, interpretations, and other guidance issuedby the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, and others, as well a potentialchange to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). In addition,the U.S. Government may issue new or revised Cost Accounting Standards or CostPrinciples. The effects of such changes may include prescribing an accountingmethod where none had been previously specified, prescribing a singleacceptable method of accounting from among several acceptable methods thatcurrently exist, or revoking the acceptability of a current method andreplacing it with an entirely different method, among others. Such changescould result in unanticipated effects on our results of operations, financialposition, and other financial measures. Our earnings and margins may vary based on the mix of our contracts andprograms. At December31, 2009, our backlog included both cost reimbursable and fixed-pricecontracts. Cost reimbursable contracts generally have lower profit margins thanfixed-price contracts. Production contracts are mainly fixed-price contracts,and developmental contracts are generally cost reimbursable contracts. Ourearnings and margins may vary materially depending on the types of long-termgovernment and commercial contracts undertaken, the nature of the productsproduced or services performed under those contracts, the costs incurred inperforming the work, the achievement of other performance objectives, and thestage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly underincentive and award fee contracts, is finally determined. Underfixed-price contracts, we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actualcosts we incur and, consequently, any costs in excess of the fixed price aregenerally absorbed by us. Under time-and-materials contracts, we are paid forlabor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses. Undercost-reimbursable contracts, subject to a contract-ceiling amount in certaincases, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee, which may be fixedor performance based. However, if our costs exceed the contract ceiling or arenot allowable under the provisions of the contract or applicable regulations,we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all such costs and may have ourfees reduced or eliminated. The failure to perform to customer expectations andcontract requirements can result in reduced fees and may affect our financialperformance for the affected period. Under each type of contract, if we areunable to control costs we incur in performing under the contract, ourfinancial condition and operating results could be materially adverselyaffected. Cost over-runs also may adversely affect our ability to sustainexisting programs and obtain future contract awards. Our backlog is subject to reduction and cancellation, which couldnegatively impact our revenues and results of operations. Backlogrepresents products or services that our customers have committed by contractto purchase from us. Backlog as of December 31, 2009 was $1.6 billion, whichincludes estimates on contracts where indefinite quantities are specified.Backlog is subject to fluctuations and is not necessarily indicative of futuresales. The U.S. government may unilaterally modify or cancel its contracts. Inaddition, under certain of our commercial contracts, our customers mayunilaterally modify or terminate their orders at any time for theirconvenience. Accordingly, certain portions of our backlog can be cancelled orreduced at the option of the U.S. government and commercial customers. Ourfailure to replace cancelled or reduced backlog could negatively impact our revenuesand results of operations. Our future financial results could be adversely impacted by assetimpairment charges. At December31, 2009, we had goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately $891million, net of accumulated amortization, which represented approximately 42%of our total assets. Our goodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annualbasis and is also tested whenever events and circumstances indicate thatgoodwill may be impaired. Any excess goodwill resulting from the impairmenttest must be written off in the period of determination. Intangible assets(other than goodwill) are generally amortized over the useful life of suchassets. In addition, from time to time, we may acquire or make an investment ina business that will require us to recordPage 20goodwill basedon the purchase price and the value of the acquired assets. We may subsequentlyexperience unforeseen issues with such business that adversely affect theanticipated returns of the business or value of the intangible assets andtrigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill andintangible assets for such business. Future determinations of significantwrite-offs of goodwill or intangible assets as a result of an impairment testor any accelerated amortization of other intangible assets could have amaterial negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.We operate in highly competitive markets. We competeagainst companies that often have greater sales volumes and financial,research, human, and marketing resources than we have. In addition, some of ourlargest customers could develop the capability to manufacture products orprovide services similar to products that we manufacture or services that weprovide. This would result in these customers supplying their own products orservices and competing directly with us for sales of these products orservices, all of which could significantly reduce our revenues. Furthermore, weare facing increased international competition and cross-border consolidationof competition. Our management believes that the principal points ofcompetition in our markets are technology, product quality, performance, price,service, contractual terms, previous installation history, technical expertise,investment, and timeliness of delivery. If we are unable to competesuccessfully with existing or new competitors in these areas, our business,financial condition, and results of operations could be materially andadversely impacted. Our future growth and continued success is dependent upon our keypersonnel. Our success isdependent upon the efforts of our senior management personnel and our abilityto attract and retain other highly qualified management personnel. We facecompetition for management from other companies and organizations. Therefore,we may not be able to retain our existing management personnel or fill newmanagement positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover at ourexisting compensation levels. Although we have entered into change of controlagreements with some members of senior management, we do not have employmentcontracts with our key executives. We have made a concerted effort to reducethe effect of the loss of our senior management personnel through managementsuccession planning. The loss of members of our senior management group couldhave a material and adverse effect on our business. In addition, competitionfor qualified technical personnel in our industries is intense, and we believethat our future growth and success will depend upon our ability to attract,train, and retain such personnel. Our international operations are subject to risks and volatility. During 2009,approximately 29% of our consolidated revenue was from customers outside of theUnited States, and we have operating facilities in foreign countries. Doingbusiness in foreign countries is subject to numerous risks, including withoutlimitation: political and economic instability; the uncertainty of the abilityof non-U.S. customers to finance purchases; restrictive trade policies; andcomplying with foreign regulatory and tax requirements that are subject tochange. While these factors or the impact of these factors are difficult topredict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operationsin the future. To the extent that foreign sales are transacted in foreigncurrencies and we do not enter into currency hedge transactions, we are exposedto risk of losses due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularlyfor the Canadian dollar, the Euro, Swiss franc, and the British pound.Significant fluctuations in the value of the currencies of the countries inwhich we do business could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.We may be unable to protect the value of our intellectual property. Obtaining,maintaining, and enforcing our intellectual property rights and avoidinginfringing on the intellectual property rights of others are important factorsto the operation of our business. While we take precautionary steps to protectour technological advantages and intellectual property and rely in part onpatent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright laws, we cannot assure that theprecautionary steps we have taken will completely protect our intellectualproperty rights. Because patent applications in the United States aremaintained in secrecy until either the patent application is published or apatent is issued, we may not be aware of third-party patents, patentapplications, and other intellectual property relevant to our products that mayblock our use of our intellectual property or may be used in third-partyproducts that compete with our products and processes. When others infringe onour intellectual property rights, the value of our products is diminished, andwe may incur substantial litigation costs to enforce our rights. Similarly, wemay incur substantial litigation costs and the obligation to pay royalties ifothers claim we infringed on their intellectual property rights. When we developintellectual property and technologies in connection with U.S. Governmentcontracts, the government has the royalty-free right to use that property. Page 21In addition toour patent rights, we also rely on unpatented technology, trade secrets, and confidentialinformation. Others may independently develop substantially equivalentinformation and techniques or otherwise gain access to or disclose ourtechnology. We may not be able to protect our rights in unpatented technology,trade secrets, and confidential information effectively. We require each of ouremployees and consultants to execute a confidentiality agreement at thecommencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us. There is noguarantee that we will succeed in obtaining and retaining executed agreementsfrom all employees or consultants. Moreover, these agreements may not provideeffective protection of our information or, in the event of unauthorized use ordisclosure, they may not provide adequate remedies. Our operations are subject to numerous domestic and international laws,regulations, and restrictions, and noncompliance with these laws, regulations,and restrictions could expose us to fines, penalties, suspension, or debarment,which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and overallfinancial condition. We havecontracts and operations in many parts of the world subject to U.S. and foreignlaws and regulations, including the False Claims Act, regulations relating toimport-export control (including the International Traffic in Arms Regulationpromulgated under the Arms Export Control Act), technology transferrestrictions, repatriation of earnings, exchange controls, the Foreign CorruptPractices Act, and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. ExportAdministration Act. Failure by us or our sales representatives or consultantsto comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative,civil, or criminal liabilities and could, in the extreme case, result insuspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our exportprivileges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are subject to liability under environmental laws. Our businessand facilities are subject to numerous federal, state, local, and foreign lawsand regulations relating to the use, manufacture, storage, handling, anddisposal of hazardous materials and other waste products. Environmental lawsgenerally impose liability for investigation, remediation, and removal ofhazardous materials and other waste products on property owners and those whodispose of materials at waste sites whether or not the waste was disposed oflegally at the time in question. We are currently addressing environmentalremediation at certain current and former facilities, and we have been named asa potentially responsible party along with other organizations in a number ofenvironmental clean-up sites and may be named in connection with future sites.We are required to contribute to the costs of the investigation and remediationand to take reserves in our financial statements for future costs deemedprobable and estimable. Although we have estimated and reserved for futureenvironmental remediation costs, the final resolution of these liabilities maysignificantly vary from our estimates and could potentially have an adverseeffect on our results of operations and financial position. Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additionalincome tax liabilities could affect our profitability. Our businessoperates in many locations under government jurisdictions that impose incometaxes. Changes in domestic or foreign income tax laws and regulations, or theirinterpretation, could result in higher or lower income tax rates assessed orchanges in the taxability of certain revenues or the deductibility of certainexpenses, thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability. Inaddition, audits by income tax authorities could result in unanticipatedincreases in our income tax expense. Our current debt, and debt we may incur in the future, could adverselyaffect our business and financial position. As of December31, 2009, we had $465 million of debt outstanding, of which $384 million islong-term debt. Our debt consists primarily of principal payable under ourfixed rate senior notes and principal payable at a variable rate of interestunder our revolving line of credit. Our level of debt could have significantconsequences for our business including: requiring us to use our cash flow topay principal and interest on our debt, reducing funds available foracquisitions and other investments in our business; making us vulnerable toeconomic downturns and increases in interest rates; limiting us from obtainingadditional debt; and impacting our ability to pay dividends. Page 22A percentage of our workforce is employed under collective bargainingagreements. Approximately9% of our workforce is employed under collective bargaining agreements, whichfrom time to time are subject to renewal and negotiation. We cannot assure youthat we will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements,that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost oflabor, or that a breakdown in such negotiations will not result in thedisruption of our operations. Although we have generally enjoyed good relationswith both our unionized and non-unionized employees, if we are subject to laboractions, we may experience an adverse impact on our operating results. Substantial defaults by our customers related to accounts receivable orthe loss of significant customers could have a significant negative impact onour business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. A significantportion of our working capital consists of accounts receivable from customers.If customers responsible for a significant amount of accounts receivable wereto become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay for products and services, orwere to become unwilling or unable to make payments in a timely manner, ourbusiness, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity could beadversely affected. An economic or industry downturn could adversely andmaterially affect the servicing of these accounts receivable, which couldresult in longer payment cycles, increased collection costs, and defaults inexcess of managements expectations. We rely on certain suppliers as a sole source of components for some ofour products. Ourmanufacturing processes for our products often consist of the assembly ofpurchased components that are generally available from a number of differentsuppliers, though several suppliers are our sole source of certain components.If a sole-source supplier should cease or otherwise be unable to deliver suchcomponents, our operating results could be adversely impacted. In addition, ifour suppliers are unable to keep up with our demand for purchased componentsand we are unable to locate additional sources of supply, our operating resultscould be adversely impacted. Our earnings and margins depend in part on subcontractor performance,as well as raw material and component availability and pricing. Our businessesdepend on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials and components. Attimes subcontractors perform services that we provide to our customers. Wedepend on these subcontractors and vendors to meet their contractualobligations in full compliance with customer requirements. These supplynetworks can sometimes experience price fluctuations. Our ability to perform ourobligations as a prime contractor may be adversely affected if one or more ofthese suppliers are unable to provide the agreed-upon supplies or perform theagreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner. While we haveattempted to mitigate the effects of increased costs through price increases,there are no assurances that higher prices can effectively be passed through toour customers or that we will be able to offset fully or on a timely basis theeffects of higher raw materials costs through price increases. Our business involves risks associated with complex manufacturingprocesses. Our manufacturing processesdepend on certain sophisticated and high-value equipment. Unexpected failuresof this equipment may result in production delays, revenue loss, andsignificant repair costs. In addition, equipment failures could result ininjuries to our employees. Moreover, the competitive nature of our businessesrequires us to continuously implement process changes intended to achieveproduct improvements and manufacturing efficiencies. These process changes mayat times result in production delays, quality concerns, and increased costs.Any disruption of operations at our facilities due to equipment failures orprocess interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business. Page 23The airline industry is heavily regulated, and if we fail to complywith applicable requirements, our results of operations could suffer.Governmentalagencies throughout the world, including the U.S. Federal AviationAdministration, or the FAA, prescribe standards and qualification requirementsfor aircraft components, including virtually all commercial airline and generalaviation products. Specific regulations vary from country to country, althoughcompliance with FAA requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements inother countries. We include, with the products that we sell to our aircraftmanufacturing customers, documentation certifying that each part complies withapplicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of airworthinessestablished by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in othercountries. In order to sell our products, we and the products we manufacturemust also be certified by our individual OEM customers. If any of the materialauthorizations or approvals qualifying us to supply our products is revoked orsuspended, then the sale of the subject product would be prohibited by law,which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, andresults of operations. From time totime, the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose newregulations or changes to existing regulations, which are usually morestringent than existing regulations. If these proposed regulations are adoptedand enacted, we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance,which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition, and results of operations.Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop newtechnologies.Virtually allof the products produced and sold by us are highly engineered and requiresophisticated manufacturing and system-integration techniques and capabilities.The commercial and government markets in which we operate are characterized byrapidly changing technologies. The product and program needs of our governmentand commercial customers change and evolve regularly. Accordingly, our futureperformance depends in part on our ability to identify emerging technologicaltrends, develop and manufacture competitive products, and bring those productsto market quickly at cost-effective prices.Potential product liability risks exist from the products that we sell.Our businessesexpose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design,manufacture, and sale of our products and the products of third-party vendorsthat we use or resell. We currently maintain what we believe to be suitable andadequate product liability insurance. There can be no assurance, however, thatwe will be able to maintain our product liability insurance on acceptable termsor that our product liability insurance will provide adequate protectionagainst potential liabilities. In the event of a claim against us, a lack ofsufficient insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations. Moreover, even if wemaintain adequate insurance, any successful claim could have a material adverseeffect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and on theability to obtain suitable or adequate insurance. Increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits couldadversely affect our results of operations. Our earningsmay be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of income or expense werecord for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. GAAP requiresthat we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations.These valuations reflect assumptions relating to financial market and othereconomic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can change theassumptions. The most significant year-end assumptions used to estimate pensionor other postretirement benefit expense for the following year are the discountrate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and expected futuremedical cost inflation. In addition, we are required to make an annualmeasurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significantchange to equity through a reduction or increase to other comprehensive income.For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected bypension and other postretirement benefit plans accounting policies, seeManagements Discussion and AnalysisCritical Accounting Estimates andPoliciesPension and Other Postretirement Benefits in Part II, Item 7.Although GAAP expense and pension or other postretirement contributions are notdirectly related, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would alsolikely affect the amount of cash the company would contribute to the pension orother postretirement plans. Potential pension contributions include bothmandatory amounts required under federal law, Employee Retirement IncomeSecurity Act (ERISA), and discretionary contributions to improve the plansfunded status. Page 24Our operating results and financial condition may be adversely impactedby the current worldwide economic conditions.We currentlygenerate significant operating cash flows, which combined with access to thecredit markets provides us with significant discretionary funding capacity.However, current uncertainty in the global economic conditions resulting fromthe recent disruption in credit markets poses a risk to the overall economythat could impact consumer and customer demand for our products, as well as ourability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers,suppliers, and creditors. If the current situation deteriorates significantly,our business could be negatively impacted, including such areas as reduceddemand for our products from a slow-down in the general economy or supplier orcustomer disruptions resulting from tighter credit markets. There are risks associated with owning our common stock.Like anyequity security, our common stock is subject to a number of risks that mayadversely impact our share price including: there is a limited trading marketin our common stock; we may not in the future be able to pay dividends on ourcommon stock; we may issue common stock for acquisitions or other purposes thatcould be dilutive to current stockholders; and we have various anti-takeoverdefenses such as our rights plan and our ability to issue preferred stock thatmay discourage a potential acquirer"
11,CW,CURTISS-WRIGHT CORP,2008-02-27,"Risk Factors
.You should carefully consider the risks described below and other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted ifany of these risks materialize. Additional risk factors not currently known to us or that we believe are immaterial also may impair our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The trading price of our common stock may also declineas a result of these risks. A substantial portion of our revenues and earnings depends upon the continued willingness of the U.S. Government and our other customers in the defense industry to buy our products and services.In 2007, approximately 40% of our revenues were derived from or related to defense programs, with approximately 18% attributable to U.S. Navy procurements. U.S. defense spending has historically been cyclical, and defensebudgets rise when perceived threats to national security increase the level of concern over the countrys safety. At other times, spending on the military can decrease. While Department of Defense funding has grown rapidly over the past fewyears, there is no assurance this trend will continue. Competing demands for federal funds can put pressure on all areas of discretionary spending, which could ultimately impact the defense budget. A decrease in U.S. government defense spending orchanges in spending allocation could result in one or more of our programs being reduced, delayed, or terminated. Reductions in defense industry spending may or may not have an adverse effect on programs for which we provide products and services.In the event expenditures are reduced for products we manufacture or services we provide and are not offset by revenues from foreign sales, new programs, or products or services that we currently manufacture or provide, we may experience a reductionin our revenues and earnings and a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, there can be no assurance that our significant customers will continue to buy our products and services at currentor increased levels.As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations. We must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with ourcustomers and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business. A violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties or the termination of our contracts or debarment from bidding on contracts.These fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards, receiving or paying kickbacks or filing falseclaims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies. The failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation. It could also result in ourprogress payments being withheld. In some instances, these laws and regulations impose terms or rights that are more favorable to the government than those typically available to commercial parties in negotiated transactions. For example, the U.S.Government may terminate any of our government contracts and, in general, subcontracts, at its convenience, as well as for default based on performance. Upon termination for convenience of a fixed-price type contract, we normally are entitled toreceive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement for allowable costs for work-in-process and anPage 18allowance for profit on the contract or adjustment for loss if completion of performance would have resulted in a loss. Upon termination for convenience of a cost reimbursement contract, we normally are entitled toreimbursement of allowable costs plus a portion of the fee. Such allowable costs would include our cost to terminate agreements with our suppliers and subcontractors. The amount of the fee recovered, if any, is related to the portion of the workaccomplished prior to termination and is determined by negotiation.A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. In addition, on those contracts for which we are teamedwith others and are not the prime contractor, the U.S. Government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor, irrespective of the quality of our services as a subcontractor.In addition, our U.S. Government contracts typically span one or more base years and multiple option years. The U.S. Government generally has the right to not exercise option periods and may not exercise an option period ifthe agency is not satisfied with our performance on the contract.U.S. Government Procurement may adversely affect our cash flow or program profitability. A significant reduction in the purchase of our products by the U.S. government would have a material adverse effect on our business. The risk that governmental purchases of our products may decline stems from the nature ofour business with the U.S. government, in which the U.S. government may: terminate, reduce or modify contracts or subcontracts if its requirements or budgetary constraints change;cancel multi-year contracts and related orders if funds become unavailable; andshift its spending priorities.In addition, as a defense business, we are subject to the following risks in connection with government contracts:the frequent need to bid on programs prior to completing the necessary design, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and/or cost overruns;the difficulty in forecasting long-term costs and schedules and the potential obsolescence of products related to long-term, fixed price contracts;our contracts are for varying fixed terms that may not be renewed or followed by follow-on contracts upon expiration; andcancellation of the follow-on production phase of contracts if program requirements are not met in the development phase.Our business could be adversely affected by a negative audit by the U.S. Government. We operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited by the U.S. Government and others. On a regular basis, we monitor our policies and procedures with respect to our contracts to ensure consistentapplication under similar terms and conditions and to assess compliance with all applicable government regulations. Negative audit findings could result in termination of a contract, forfeiture of profits, or suspension of payments. From time totime we are subject to U.S. Government investigations relating to our operations. Government contractors that are found to have violated the law, such as the False Claims Act or the Arms Export Control Act, or are indicted or convicted forviolations of other federal laws, or are found not to have acted responsibly as defined by the law, may be subject to significant fines. Such convictions could also result in suspension or debarment from government contracting for some period oftime. Given our dependence on government contracting, suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on our business.Page 19Failure to comply with certain U.S. Government sourcing requirements may adversely affect our cash flow. We, like others in the defense industry, are awareof a potential problem presented by strict compliance with the Defense FederalAcquisition Regulation Supplement preference for enumerated specialty metalssourced  domestically or from certain foreign countries. Subcontractors and lower-tiersuppliers have made disclosures indicating inability to comply with the ruleas written, particularly for low-value parts such as washers, screws, nuts, bolts,resistors  and capacitors. Subject to limitations, inability to certify thatall enumerated specialty metals in a product comply with sourcing requirementscan lead to U.S. Government customers withholding a portion of a payment on deliveryor may prevent  delivery altogether of material and products critical to nationaldefense.Our operating results are subject to fluctuations.Defense industry procurement involves seasonality and economic cycles and as a result our annual and quarterly operating results may fluctuate. It is possible that our operating results for a particular quarter may not meetthe expectations of securities analysts or investors. Similarly, securities analysts may issue reports downgrading our common stock. These events could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Future terror attacks, war, or other events could adversely impact our commercial aerospace and other businesses. Despite our concerted effort to minimize risk to our production capabilities and corporate information systems and to reduce the effect of unforeseen interruptions to us through business continuity planning and disasterrecovery plans, terrorist attacks, war, or other events such as strikes by a significant customers or suppliers workforce could adversely impact demand for or supply of our products and could also cause disruption to our facilities orsystems which could also interrupt operational processes and adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products and provide services and support to our customers. For example, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and subsequentterrorist attacks worldwide caused decreased demand in the commercial aerospace market for our products and commercial overhaul and repair services.  During 2007, approximately 17% of our business was related to commercial aerospace. The commercialaerospace industry is cyclical and subject to factors beyond our control. A number of commercial airline carriers have recently experienced large losses and filed for bankruptcy. Financial difficulties of our customers, delays in production of newaircraft, high fuel prices and decreased demand for new aircraft and continued use of existing aircraft could adversely affect our operating results and financial position. The success of our growth strategy is dependent upon our ability to complete acquisitions and integrate acquired businesses. Our strategy includes growth through acquisitions. As a result, our future growth depends in large part on our ability to implement our acquisition strategy and successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existingoperations. If we are unable to identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, obtain financing, and successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations, our growth strategy may not be successful. Inaddition, acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, technologies, services, and products of the acquired company, the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company, and the diversionof our managements attention from other business concerns. This is the case particularly in the fiscal quarters immediately following the completion of an acquisition because the operations of the acquired business are integrated into theacquiring businesses operations during this period. We cannot be sure that we will accurately anticipate all of the changing demands that any future acquisition may impose on our management, our operational and management information systems,and our financial systems. Once integrated, acquired operations may not achieve levels of revenue, profitability, or productivity comparable to those of our existing operations or may otherwise not perform as we expected. We may fail to discoverliabilities relating to a pending acquisition during the due diligence investigation, liabilities for which we, as the successor owner, might be responsible for those liabilities. Although we seek to minimize the impact of potential undiscoveredliabilities by structuring acquisitions to minimize liabilities and obtaining indemnities and warranties from the selling party, these methods may not fully protect us from the impact of undiscovered liabilities. For example, indemnities orwarranties are often limited in scope, amount, or duration, and may not fully cover the liabilities for which they were intended. If indemnities or warranties are limited, the liabilities that are not covered by the limited indemnities or warrantiescould have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Page 20We use estimates when accounting for contracts. Changes in estimates could affect our profitability and overall financial position. Contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, theestimation of total revenues and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. For example, assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wagesand prices for materials. Similarly, assumptions have to be made regarding the future impact of efficiency initiatives and cost reduction efforts. Incentives, awards, or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimatingrevenue and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, it is possible that materially different amountscould be obtained if different assumptions were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances, or estimates may have a material adverse effect upon future period financial reporting andperformance. See Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies in Part II, Item 7.New accounting standards could result in changes to our methods of quantifying and recording accounting transactions, and could affect our financial results and financial position.Changes to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (GAAP) arise from new and revised standards, interpretations, and other guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, andothers. In addition, the U.S. Government may issue new or revised Cost Accounting Standards or Cost Principles. The effects of such changes may include prescribing an accounting method where none had been previously specified, prescribing a singleacceptable method of accounting from among several acceptable methods that currently exist, or revoking the acceptability of a current method and replacing it with an entirely different method, among others. Such changes could result inunanticipated effects on our results of operations, financial position, and other financial measures.Our earnings and margins may vary based on the mix of our contracts and programs. At December 31, 2007, our backlog included both cost reimbursable and fixed-price contracts. Cost reimbursable contracts generally have lower profit margins than fixed-price contracts. Production contracts are mainlyfixed-price contracts, and developmental contracts are generally cost reimbursable contracts. Our earnings and margins may vary materially depending on the types of long-term government and commercial contracts undertaken, the nature of the productsproduced or services performed under those contracts, the costs incurred in performing the work, the achievement of other performance objectives, and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive and awardfee contracts, is finally determined.Under fixed-price contracts, we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and, consequently, any costs in excess of the fixed price are absorbed by us. Under time-and-materials contracts, we are paidfor labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses. Under cost-reimbursable contracts, subject to a contract-ceiling amount in certain cases, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee, which may be fixed or performancebased. However, if our costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or applicable regulations, we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all such costs and may have our fees reduced or eliminated.The failure to perform to customer expectations and contract requirements can result in reduced fees and may affect our financial performance for the affected period. Under each type of contract, if we are unable to control costs we incur inperforming under the contract, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. Cost over-runs also may adversely affect our ability to sustain existing programs and obtain future contract awards.We operate in highly competitive markets.We compete against companies that often have greater sales volumes and financial, research, human, and marketing resources than we have. In addition, some of our largest customers could develop the capability to manufactureproducts or provide services similar to products that we manufacture or services that we provide. This would result in these customers supplying their own products or services and competing directly with us for sales of these products or services,all of which could significantly reduce our revenues. Furthermore, we are facing increased international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition. Our management believes that the principal points of competition in our markets areproduct quality, performance, price, design and engineering capabilities,Page 21service, contractual terms, previous installation history, and timeliness of delivery. If we are unable to compete successfully with existing or new competitors in these areas, our business, financial condition, and resultsof operations could be materially and adversely impacted. Our future growth and continued success is dependent upon our key personnel. Our success is dependent upon the efforts of our seniormanagement personnel and our ability to attract and retain other highly qualifiedmanagement personnel. We face competition for management from other companiesand organizations. Therefore, we may not be able to retain our existing managementpersonnel or fill new management positions or vacancies created by expansionor turnover at our existing compensation levels. Although we have entered intochange of control agreements with some members of senior management, we do nothave employment contracts with our key executives. We have made a concerted effortto reduce the effect of the loss of our senior management personnel through managementsuccession planning. The loss of members of our senior management group couldhave a material and adverse effect on our business. In addition, competitionfor qualified technical personnel in our industries is intense, and we believethat our future growth and success will depend upon our ability to attract, train,and retain such personnel. Our international operations are subject to risks and volatility. During 2007, approximately 30% of our consolidatedrevenue was from customers outside of the United States, and we have operatingfacilities in foreign countries. Doing business in foreign countries is subjectto numerous risks, including without limitation: political and economic instability;the uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases; restrictivetrade policies; and complying with foreign regulatory and tax requirements thatare subject to change. While these factors or the impact of these factors aredifficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affectour operations in the future. To the extent that foreign sales are transactedin foreign currencies and we do not enter into currency hedge transactions, weare exposed to risk of losses due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchangerates, particularly for the Canadian dollar, the euro, Swiss franc, and the Britishpound. Significant fluctuations in the value of the currencies of the countriesin which we do business could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. We may be unable to protect the value of our intellectual property.Our success depends in part on obtaining, maintaining, and enforcing our intellectual property rights and avoiding infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. While we take precautionary steps to protect ourtechnological advantages and intellectual property and rely in part on patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright laws, we cannot assure that the precautionary steps we have taken will completely protect our intellectual property rights. Becausepatent applications in the United States are maintained in secrecy until either the patent application is published or a patent is issued, we may not be aware of third-party patents, patent applications, and other intellectual property relevant toour products that may block our use of our intellectual property or may be used in third-party products that compete with our products and processes. When others infringe on our intellectual property rights, the value of our products is diminished,and we may incur substantial litigation costs to enforce our rights. Similarly, we may incur substantial litigation costs and the obligation to pay royalties if others claim we infringed on their intellectual property rights. When we developintellectual property and technologies in connection with U.S. Government contracts, the government has the royalty-free right to use that property.In addition to our patent rights, we also rely on unpatented technology, trade secrets, and confidential information. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques or otherwise gainaccess to or disclose our technology. We may not be able to protect our rights in unpatented technology, trade secrets, and confidential information effectively. We require each of our employees and consultants to execute a confidentiality agreementat the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us. However, these agreements may not provide effective protection of our information or, in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure, they may not provide adequateremedies.Page 22Our operations are subject to numerous domestic and international laws, regulations, and restrictions, and noncompliance with these laws, regulations, and restrictions could expose us to fines, penalties, suspension, ordebarment, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and overall financial condition. We have contracts and operations in many parts of the world subject to U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including the False Claims Act, regulations relating to import-export control (including the InternationalTraffic in Arms Regulation promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act), technology transfer restrictions, repatriation of earnings, exchange controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. ExportAdministration Act. Failure by us or our sales representatives or consultants to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities and could, in the extreme case, result in suspension or debarmentfrom government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.We are subject to liability under environmental laws.Our business and facilities are subject to numerous federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to the use, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials and other waste products.Environmental laws generally impose liability for investigation, remediation, and removal of hazardous materials and other waste products on property owners and those who dispose of materials at waste sites whether or not the waste was disposed oflegally at the time in question. We are currently addressing environmental remediation at certain current and former facilities, and we have been named as a potentially responsible party along with other organizations in a number of environmentalclean-up sites and may be named in connection with future sites. We are required to contribute to the costs of the investigation and remediation and to take reserves in our financial statements for future costs deemed probable and estimable.Although we have estimated and reserved for future environmental remediation costs, the final resolution of these liabilities may significantly vary from our estimates and could potentially have an adverse effect on our results of operations andfinancial position.Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability.Our business operates in many locations under government jurisdictions that impose income taxes. Changes in domestic or foreign income tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or lowerincome tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain revenues or the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability. In addition, audits by income tax authorities could result inunanticipated increases in our income tax expense.Our current debt, and debt we may incur in the future, could adversely affect our business and financial position. As of December 31, 2007, we had $512 million of debt outstanding, of which $511 million is long-term debt. Our debt consists primarily of principal payable under our fixed rate senior notes and principal payable ata variable rate of interest under our revolving line of credit. Our level of debt could have significant consequences for our business including: requiring us to use our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, reducing funds availablefor acquisitions and other investments in our business; making us vulnerable to economic downturns and increases in interest rates; limiting us from obtaining additional debt; and impacting our ability to pay dividends.A percentage of our workforce is employed under collective bargaining agreements. Approximately 9% of our workforce is employed undercollective bargaining agreements, which from time to time are subject to renewaland negotiation. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in negotiatingnew collective bargaining agreements, or that such negotiations will not resultin significant increases in the cost of labor or that a breakdown in such negotiationswill not result in the disruption of our operations. Although we have generallyenjoyed good relations with both our unionized and non-unionized employees, ifwe are subject to labor actions, we may experience an adverse impact on our operatingresults.Page 23Substantial defaults by our customers on their accounts receivable or the loss of significant customers could have a significant negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition orliquidity. A significant portion of our working capital consists of accounts receivable from customers. If customers responsible for a significant amount of accounts receivable were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay forproducts and services, or were to become unwilling or unable to make payments in a timely manner, our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity could be adversely affected. An economic or industry downturn could adversely andmaterially affect the servicing of these accounts receivable, which could result in longer payment cycles, increased collection costs, and defaults in excess of managements expectations.We rely on certain suppliers as a sole source of components for some of our products. Our manufacturing processes for our products often consist of the assembly of purchased components that are generally available from a number of different suppliers, though several suppliers are our sole source of certaincomponents. If a sole source supplier should cease or otherwise be unable to deliver such components, our operating results could be adversely impacted.  In addition, if our suppliers are unable to keep up with our demand for purchased componentsand we are unable to locate additional sources of supply, our operating results could be adversely impacted. Our earnings and margins depend in part on subcontractor performance, as well as raw material and component availability and pricing. Our businesses depend on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials and components. At times subcontractors perform services that we provide to our customers. We depend on these subcontractors and vendors to meet theircontractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements. These supply networks can sometimes experience price fluctuations.  Our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor may be adversely affected if one or more of thesesuppliers is unable to provide the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner. While we have attempted to mitigate the effects of increased costs through price increases, there are no assurancesthat higher prices can effectively be passed through to our customers or that we will be able to offset fully or on a timely basis the effects of higher raw materials costs through price increases.Our business involves risks associated with complex manufacturing processes. Our manufacturing processes depend on certain sophisticated and high-value equipment. Unexpected failures of this equipment may result in production delays, revenue loss, and significant repair costs. In addition, equipmentfailures could result in injuries to our employees. Moreover, the competitive nature of our businesses requires us continuously to implement process changes intended to achieve product improvements and manufacturing efficiencies. These processchanges may at times result in production delays, quality concerns, and increased costs. Any disruption of operations at our facilities due to equipment failures or process interruptions could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness.Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop new technologies. Virtually all of the products produced and sold by us are highly engineered and require sophisticated manufacturing and system-integration techniques and capabilities. The commercial and government markets in which weoperate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies. The product and program needs of our government and commercial customers change and evolve regularly. Accordingly, our future performance depends in part on our ability to identify emergingtechnological trends, develop and manufacture competitive products, and bring those products to market quickly at cost-effective prices. Potential product liability risks exist from the products that we sell.Our businesses expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, and sale of our products and the products of third-party vendors that we use or resell. We currently maintain whatwe believe to be suitable and adequate product liability insurance. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to maintain our product liability insurance on acceptable terms or that our product liability insurance will provideadequate protection against potential liabilities. In the event of a claim against us, a lack of sufficient insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Page 24Moreover, even if we maintain adequate insurance, any successful claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and on the ability to obtain suitable or adequateinsurance.Increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our results of operations.Our earnings may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of income or expense we record for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United Statesof America require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions relating to financial market and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can change theassumptions. The most significant year-end assumptions used to estimate pension or other postretirement benefit expense for the following year are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and expected future medicalcost inflation. In addition, we are required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant change to equity through a reduction or increase to other comprehensive income. For a discussion regardinghow our financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement benefit plans accounting policies, see Managements Discussion and AnalysisCritical Accounting Estimates and PoliciesPension and OtherPostretirement Benefits in Part II, Item 7. Although GAAP expense and pension or other postretirement contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash thecompany would contribute to the pension or other postretirement plans. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and discretionary contributions toimprove the plans funded status.While we believe our control systems are effective, there are inherent limitations in all control systems, and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.We continue to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls, disclosure controls, and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and ChiefFinancial Officer, cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible errors or all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurancethat the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitationsin all control systems, no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Corporation have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments indecision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Further, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls.The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential futureconditions. Over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due toerror or fraud may occur and may not be detected.There are risks associated with owning our common stock. Like any equity security, our common stock is subject to a number of risks that may adversely impact our share price including: there is a limited trading market in our common stock; we may not in the future be able to paydividends on our common stock; we may issue common stock for acquisitions or other purposes that could be dilutive to current stockholders; and we have various anti-takeover defenses such as our rights plan and our ability to issue preferred stockthat may discourage a potential acquirer"

.You should carefully consider the risks described below and other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted ifany of these risks materialize. Additional risk factors not currently known to us or that we believe are immaterial also may impair our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The trading price of our common stock may also declineas a result of these risks. A substantial portion of our revenues and earnings is dependent upon the continued willingness of the U.S. Government and our other customers in the defense industry to buy our products and services.In 2006, approximately 45% of our revenues were derived from or related to defense programs, with approximately 21% attributable to U.S. Navy procurements. The loss of a significant defense program or customer could have amaterial adverse effect on our operating results.  There can be no assurance that our significant customers will continue to buy our products and services at current or increased levels.Our business with the U.S. Government and defense contractors is subject to risks including: termination, reduction, or modification of our contracts, subcontracts, and backlog in the event of changes in the U.S.Governments requirements, spending priorities, or defense-related budgets; when we are a subcontractor, the failure or inability of the prime contractor to perform its prime contract; in some contracts the final price per unit may be deferred;adjustment of contract costs and fees as a result of government audits; the frequent need to bid on programs in advance of design completion that may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns; our contracts are for varyingfixed terms that may not be renewed or followed by follow-on contracts upon expiration; and cancellation of the follow-on production phase of contracts if program requirements are not met in the development phase.Reductions in defense industry spending may or may not have an adverse effect on programs for which we provide products and services. In the event expenditures are reduced for products we manufacture or services we provideand are not offset by revenues from foreign sales, new programs, or products or services that we currently manufacture or provide, we may experience a reduction in our revenues and earnings and a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition, and results of operations. Our operating results are subject to fluctuations.Defense industry procurement involves seasonality and economic cycles and as a result our annual and quarterly operating results may fluctuate. It is possible that our operating results for a particular quarter may not meetthe expectations of securities analysts or investors. Similarly, securities analysts may issue reports downgrading our common stock. These events could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Future terror attacks, war, or other events could adversely impact our commercial aerospace and other businesses. Despite our concerted effort to minimize risk to our production capabilities and corporate information systems and to reduce the effect of unforeseen interruptions to us through business continuity planning, terroristattacks, war, or other events such as strikes by a significant customers workforce could adversely impact demand for our products and could also cause disruption to our facilities or systems which could also interrupt operational processes andadversely impact our ability to manufacture our products and provide services and support to our customers. For example, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and subsequent terrorist attacks worldwide caused decreased demand in the commercialaerospace market for our products and commercial overhaul and repair services. During 2006, approximately 18% of our business was related to commercial aerospace. The commercial aerospace industry is cyclical and subject to factors beyond ourcontrol.  A number of commercial airline carriers have recently experienced large losses and filed for bankruptcy. Financial difficulties of our customers and decreased demand for new aircraft and continued use of existing aircraft could adverselyaffect our operating results and financial position. Page 17The success of our growth strategy is dependent upon our ability to complete acquisitions and integrate acquired businesses. Our strategy includes growth through acquisitions. As a result, our future growth depends in large part on our ability to implement our acquisition strategy and successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existingoperations. If we are unable to identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, obtain financing, and successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations, our future growth and operating results could beadversely impacted.We operate in highly competitive markets.We compete against companies that often have greater sales volumes and financial, research, human, and marketing resources than we have. Our management believes that the principal points of competition in our markets are productquality, price, design and engineering capabilities, product development, conformity to customer specifications, quality of post-sale support, timeliness of delivery, and effectiveness of the distribution organization. If we are unable to competesuccessfully with existing or new competitors in these areas, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted. Our future growth and continued success is dependent upon our key personnel. Our success is dependent upon the efforts of our senior management personnel. The loss of members of our senior management group could have a material and adverse effect on our business. In addition, competition forqualified technical personnel in our industries is intense, and we believe that our future growth and success will depend upon our ability to attract, train, and retain such personnel. Our international operations are subject to risks and volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. During 2006, approximately 25% of our consolidatedrevenue was from customers outside of the United States, and we have operatingfacilities in foreign countries. Doing business in foreign countries is subjectto numerous risks including: political and economic instability, restrictivetrade policies, and complying with foreign regulatory and tax requirements thatare subject to change. To the extent that foreign sales are transacted in foreigncurrencies and we do not enter into currency hedge transactions, we are exposedto risk of losses due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularlyfor the Canadian dollar, the euro, Swiss franc, and the British pound. Significantfluctuations in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do businesscould have an adverse effect on our results of operations. We may be unable to protect the value of our intellectual property.Our success depends in part on obtaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and avoiding infringing on the intellectual property rights of others.  When others infringe our intellectual property rights, thevalue of our products is diminished, and we may incur substantial litigation costs to enforce our rights. Similarly, we may incur substantial litigation costs and the obligation to pay royalties if others claim we infringed their intellectualproperty rights. When we develop intellectual property and technologies in connection with U.S. Government contracts, the government has the royalty-free right to use that property.Our business is subject to substantial regulation.We are subject to numerous regulations including but not limited to those relating to federal government contracting and export compliance. Our failure to comply with these and other laws could result in contract termination and debarment,civil fines and damages, and criminal prosecution and penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. We are subject to liability under environmental laws.Our business and facilities are subject to numerous federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to the use, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials and other waste products.Environmental laws generally impose liability for investigation, remediation, and removal of hazardous materials and other waste products on property owners and those who dispose of materials at waste sites whether or not thePage 18waste was disposed of legally at the time in question. We have been named as a potentially responsible party along with other organizations in a number of environmental clean-up sites and may be named in connection withfuture sites. We are required to contribute to the costs of the investigation and remediation and to take reserves in our financial statements for future costs deemed probable and estimable. Although we have estimated and reserved for futureenvironmental remediation costs, the final resolution of these liabilities may significantly vary from our estimates and could potentially have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.Our current debt, and debt we may incur in the future, could adversely affect our business and financial position. As of December 31, 2006, we had $364.9 million of debt outstanding, of which $359.0 million is long-term debt. Our debt consists primarily of principal payable under our fixed rate senior notes. Our level of debtcould have significant consequences for our business including: requiring us to use our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, reducing funds available for acquisitions and other investments in our business; making us vulnerable toeconomic downturns and increases in interest rates; limiting us from obtaining additional debt; and impacting our ability to pay dividends.A percentage of our workforce is employed under collective bargaining agreements. Approximately 12% of our workforce is employed under collective bargaining agreements, which from time to time are subject to renewal and negotiation. Although we have generally enjoyed good relations with both ourunionized and non-unionized employees, if we are subject to labor actions, we may experience an adverse impact on our operating results.We rely on certain suppliers as a sole source of components for some of our products. Our manufacturing processes for our products often consist of the assembly of purchased components that are generally available from a number of different suppliers, though several suppliers are our sole source of certaincomponents. If a sole source supplier should cease or otherwise be unable to deliver such components, our operating results could be adversely impacted.Our future performance is influenced by costs incurred by our operating companies including, for example, the costs of raw materials Our businesses depend on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials and components. These supply networks can experience price fluctuations. While we have attempted to mitigate the effects of increased costs throughprice increases, there are no assurances that higher prices can effectively be passed through to our customers or that we will be able to offset fully or on a timely basis the effects of higher raw materials costs through price increases.Our business involves risks associated with complex manufacturing processes. Our manufacturing processes depend on certain sophisticated and high-value equipment. Unexpected failures of this equipment may result in production delays, revenue loss, and significant repair costs. In addition, equipmentfailures could result in injuries to our employees. Moreover, the competitive nature of our businesses requires us continuously to implement process changes intended to achieve product improvements and manufacturing efficiencies. These processchanges may at times result in production delays, quality concerns, and increased costs. Any disruption of operations at our facilities due to equipment failures or process interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business. Potential product liability risks exist from the products that we sell.  Our businesses expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, and sale of our products and the products of third-party vendors that we use or resell. We currently maintain whatwe believe to be suitable and adequate product liability insurance. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to maintain our product liability insurance on acceptable terms or that our product liability insurance will provideadequate protection against potential liabilities. In the event of a claim against us, a lack of sufficient insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Moreover, even if wemaintain adequate insurance, any successful claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and on the ability to obtain suitable or adequate insurance.Page 19Increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our results of operations.  The amount of expenses recorded for our defined benefit pension plans is dependent on changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets, which are dependent on actual plan asset returns. Significant changes inmarket interest rates and decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may adversely affect our future results of operations.  While we believe our control systems are effective, there are inherent limitations in all control systems, and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.We continue to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls, disclosure controls and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and ChiefFinancial Officer, cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible errors or all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurancethat the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitationsin all control systems, no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Corporation have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments indecision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Further, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls.The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential futureconditions. Over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.
