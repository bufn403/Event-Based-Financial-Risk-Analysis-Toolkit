5,GLT,GLATFELTER,2024-02-28,"ITEM 1A    RISK FACTORSOur business and financial performance may be adversely affected by a weak global economic environment or downturns in the target markets that we serve.Adverse global economic conditions could impact our target markets resulting in decreased demand for our products. Our results could be adversely affected if economic conditions weaken. Also, there may be periods during which demand for our products could be insufficient to enable us to operate our production facilities at full capacity and in an economical manner which may force us to curtail production by taking machine downtime. Approximately 46% of our net sales in 2023 was from shipments to customers in Europe, the demand for which is dependent on economic conditions in this region, or to the extent such customers do business outside of Europe, in other regions of the world. Uncertain economic conditions in this region may cause weakness in demand for our products, as well as volatility in our customers buying patterns. The cost of raw materials and energy used to manufacture our products could increase or the availability of certain raw materials could become constrained.Our business requires access to sufficient, and reasonably priced, quantities of wood pulps, different pulps, pulp substitutes, abaca fiber, polyester and various synthetic fibers, and certain other raw materials, as well as access to reliable and abundant supplies of water to support many of our production facilities. Therefore, volatility in the price of key raw materials can have a significant impact on our results of operations.Our Philippine production site purchases raw abaca fiber to produce abaca pulp, a key material used to manufacture material for single-serve coffee, tea, and technical specialty products at Composite Fibers’ facilities. At certain times, the supply of abaca fiber has been constrained or the quality diminished due to factors such as weather-related damage to the source crop, as well as decisions by landowners to produce alternative crops in lieu of those used to produce abaca fiber. These factors have contributed to volatility in fiber prices or limited available supply.Airlaid Materials requires access to sufficient quantities of fluff pulp, the supply of which is subject to availability of certain softwoods. The cost of many of our production materials, including petroleum-based chemicals and freight charges, are influenced by the cost of oil. Natural gas is the principal source of fuel for each of our facilities worldwide and prices have historically been more volatile than other fuels. Our manufacturing operations are energy-intensive and prices can fluctuate significantly based on demand.Government rules, regulations and policies have an impact on the cost of certain energy sources, particularly for our European operations. In Europe, we currently benefit from a number of government-sponsored programs related to, among others, green energy or renewable energy initiatives designed to mitigate the cost of electricity to larger industrial consumers of power. Any reduction in the extent of government sponsored incentives may adversely affect the cost ultimately borne by our operations. Although we have contractual arrangements with certain customers pursuant to which our product’s selling price is adjusted for changes in the cost of certain raw materials and energy, we may not be able to fully pass increased raw materials or energy costs on to all customers if the market will not bear the higher price or if existing supply agreements limit price increases. If price adjustments significantly trail increases in raw materials costs, our operating results could be adversely affected.Our turnaround strategy is time-consuming and expensive and could significantly disrupt our business.We initiated a significant turnaround strategy in late 2022 in an effort to optimize our portfolio, improve margins, reduce fixed costs, liberate cash, improve operational effectiveness and return Spunlace to profitability. These turnaround actions were, and will continue to be, initiated to deliver significantly improved financial performance. The nature of these activities involves topics that are complex and time-consuming in nature, and could significantly disrupt our business if we fail to execute them properly, which could ultimately result in financial impacts to the Company.The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Approximately $36 million and $40 million, or 2.6% and 2.7% of our net sales in 2023 and 2022, respectively, were earned from customers located in Russia and Ukraine. The geopolitical conditions resulting from the Russia/Ukraine military conflict, including government-imposed sanctions and the current macroeconomic climate in Russia and Ukraine, Table of Contentshave adversely impacted both demand for our products and our ability to deliver products to this region, as well as, limited customers' access to financial resources and their ability to satisfy obligations to us. For example, as a direct result of the military conflict, economic sanctions, and the disruptions in the region’s financial systems, we have had a significant reduction in wallcover revenues and cash flows. We expect this reduction to continue for the foreseeable future and most directly impact our facility located in Dresden, Germany that produces wallcover base paper, a significant portion of which historically was sold into the Ukraine and Russian markets. As a result, during the first quarter of 2022, we recorded a $117.3 million non-cash asset impairment charge related to assets of our Dresden facility and an impairment of our Composite Fibers business' goodwill. In addition, we operate manufacturing sites elsewhere in Europe that have been adversely impacted as a result of the military conflict in Ukraine and related geopolitical events and sanctions.In the event that current geopolitical tensions fail to abate, or deteriorate further, or additional governmental sanctions are enacted against the Russian economy or its banking and monetary systems, we may face additional adverse consequences to our business and results of operations. Even if the conflict moderates or a resolution between Ukraine and Russia is reached, we expect that we will continue to experience ongoing adverse consequences to our business, financial condition, and results of operation resulting from the conflict for the foreseeable future, including and because certain of the economic and other sanctions imposed, or that may be imposed, against Russia may continue for a period of time after any resolution has been reached.Disruption of our global supply chain could adversely affect our business.Our ability to manufacture, sell and distribute products is critical to our operations. Our products contain raw materials that we source globally from suppliers. If there is a shortage of a key raw material in our supply chain, and a replacement cannot be readily sourced from an alternative supplier, the shortage may disrupt our production. Likewise, disruptions in the transportation and delivery of products - both from suppliers to our production facilities, and from our production facilities to our customers - may impact our ability to sell product and deliver goods to our customers on time and in full. In addition, the costs of transporting materials and products through our chain of sourcing and production may increase, and such increases could be significant. The failure of third parties on which we rely, including those third parties who supply our raw materials, packaging, capital equipment and other necessary operating materials, contract manufacturers, commercial transport, distributors, contractors, and external business partners, to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, may negatively impact our operations. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such disruptions, or to effectively manage such disruptions if they occur, could adversely affect our business and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore our global supply chain. Any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.A significant proportion of our net sales and earnings is generated from operations outside of the United States. In addition, we own and operate manufacturing facilities in Canada, Germany, France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the Philippines. A significant portion of our business is transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Philippine peso, among others. Our euro denominated net sales exceed euro expenses by an estimated €170 million. With respect to the British pound, Canadian dollar, and Philippine peso, we have greater outflows than inflows of these currencies, although to a lesser degree than the euro. As a result, we are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates and such changes could be significant.Our ability to maintain our products' price competitiveness is reliant, in part, on the relative strength of the currency in which the product is denominated compared to the currency of the market into which it is sold and the functional currency of our competitors. Changes in the rate of exchange of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar, and other currencies, may adversely impact our results of operations and our ability to offer products in certain markets at acceptable prices. In the event of significant currency weakening in the countries into which our products are sold, demand for our products, pricing of our products, or a customer’s ability to satisfy obligations to us, could be adversely impacted. GLATFELTER 2023 FORM 10-K9Table of ContentsOur industry is highly competitive and increased competition could reduce our sales and profitability.The global markets in which we compete are served by a variety of competitors and a variety of substrates. As a result, our ability to compete is sensitive to, and may be adversely impacted by: •the entry of new competitors into the segments we serve;•the aggressiveness of our competitors’ pricing strategies, which could force us to decrease prices in order to maintain market share;•our failure to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences; and•technological advances or changes that impact production or cost competitiveness of our products.The impact of any significant changes may result in our inability to effectively compete in the segments in which we operate, and as a result our sales and operating results would be adversely affected.We may not be able to develop new products acceptable to our existing or potential customers.Our business strategy is market focused and includes investments in developing new products to meet the changing needs of our customers, serve new customers and to maintain our market share. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop and introduce new and enhanced products that keep pace with introductions by our competitors and changing customer preferences. If we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to these factors, we may lose opportunities for business with both current and potential customers. The success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors, including our ability to:•anticipate and properly identify our customers' needs and industry trends;•develop and commercialize new products and applications in a timely manner;•price our products competitively;•differentiate our products from our competitors' products; and•invest efficiently in research and development activities.Our inability to develop new products or new business opportunities could adversely impact our business and ultimately harm our profitability.We are subject to substantial costs and potential liability for environmental matters.We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations, including discharges into the environment, and the handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. We are also subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and clean-up responsibility for releases of hazardous substances. To comply with environmental laws and regulations, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial expenditures. We may incur obligations to remove or mitigate any adverse effects on the environment, such as air and water quality, resulting from production sites we operate or have operated. Potential obligations include costs for government oversight of the remediation activities, the restoration of natural resources, and/or personal injury and property damages. We generate a substantial portion of Airlaid Materials' and Spunlace's  net sales from a few large customers and the loss of any one could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.The top three customers in each of these segments, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 57% of Airlaid Materials’ and approximately 42% of Spunlace’s net sales in 2023. Furthermore, Airlaid Materials and Spunlace derive approximately 37% and 7%, respectively, of their annual net sales from sales to the feminine hygiene market.  The loss of any one of these large customers or a decline in sales of hygiene products could have a material adverse effect on these segments’ operating results. Our ability to effectively compete could be affected by technological production alternatives, which could provide substitute products into this segment. Customers in the airlaid and spunlace nonwoven fabric material segments including hygiene, may also switch to less expensive products, change preferences or otherwise reduce demand for our products, thus reducing the size of the segments in which we currently sell our products. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and business prospects.Our operations may be impaired, and we may be exposed to potential losses and liability as a result of natural disasters, acts of terrorism or sabotage or similar events.If we have a catastrophic loss or unforeseen operational disruption at any of our facilities, we could suffer significant lost production which could impair our ability to satisfy customer demands.Table of ContentsNatural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, typhoons, flooding or fire, and acts of terrorism or sabotage affecting our operating activities and major facilities could materially and adversely affect our operations, operating results and financial condition.In addition, many of our operations require a reliable and abundant supply of water. Such sites rely on local bodies of water or water sources for their production needs and, therefore, are particularly sensitive to drought conditions or other natural or man-made interruptions to water supplies. Any interruption or curtailment of operations at any of our production facilities due to flooding, drought or low flow conditions at the principal water source or another cause could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.Our pulp facility in Lanao del Norte on the Island of Mindanao in the Republic of the Philippines is located along the Pacific Rim, one of the world’s hazard belts. By virtue of its geographic location, this site is subject to similar types of natural disasters discussed above, cyclones, typhoons, and volcanic activity. Moreover, the area of Lanao del Norte has been a target of suspected terrorist activities. Our pulp mill in Mindanao is located in a rural portion of the island and is susceptible to attacks and/or power interruptions. The Mindanao site supplies the abaca pulp used by Composite Fibers to manufacture paper for single serve coffee and tea products and certain technical specialties products. Any interruption, loss, or extended curtailment of operations at our Mindanao site could affect our ability to meet customer demands for our products and materially affect our operating results and financial condition.We have operations in a potentially politically and economically unstable location.Our pulp facility in the Philippines is located in a region that is unstable and subject to political unrest. As discussed above, our Philippine pulp facility produces abaca pulp, a significant raw material used by Composite Fibers and is currently our main source of abaca pulp. There are limited suitable alternative sources of readily available abaca pulp in the world. In the event of a disruption in supply from our Philippine site, there is no guarantee that we could obtain adequate amounts of abaca pulp, if at all, from alternative sources at a reasonable price. Further, there is no assurance the performance of such alternative materials will satisfy customer performance requirements. As a consequence, any civil disturbance, unrest, political instability, or other event that causes a disruption in supply could limit the availability of abaca pulp and would increase our cost of obtaining abaca pulp. Such occurrences could adversely impact our sales volumes, net sales, and operating results.Our international operations pose certain risks that may adversely impact sales and earnings.We have significant operations and assets located in Canada, Germany, France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the Philippines. Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of unique risks, in addition to the risks in our domestic sales and operations, including, but not limited to, economic and trade disruptions resulting from geopolitical developments, wars or other military conflicts (such as the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East), differing protections of intellectual property, trade barriers, labor unrest, exchange controls, regional economic uncertainty, differing (and possibly more stringent) labor regulation, risk of governmental expropriation, domestic and foreign customs and tariffs, differing regulatory environments, difficulty in managing widespread operations and political instability. These factors may adversely affect our future profits. Also, in some foreign jurisdictions, we may be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remit earnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met. Any such limitations would restrict our flexibility in using funds generated in those jurisdictions.Our business depends on good relations with our employees and attracting and retaining key employees.As of December 31, 2023, we employed approximately 2,920 people worldwide, the substantial majority of whom are skilled personnel responsible for the production and commercialization of our Airlaid Materials, Composite Fibers, and Spunlace products. Our facilities are a continuous flow manufacturing operation with approximately 68.3% of our employees represented by local works councils or trade unions in Europe, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the Philippines. The risk of labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in production could adversely affect us, especially in conjunction with potential restructuring activities. Any work stoppage or failure to reach agreements with local works councils or trade unions could have a material adverse effect on our customer relations, our productivity, the profitability of a manufacturing facility, our ability to develop new products and our operations as a whole. Furthermore, the loss of any of our key employees, including our CEO and their direct reports, could adversely affect our business and thus our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. GLATFELTER 2023 FORM 10-K11Table of ContentsWe are subject to cyber-security risks related to unauthorized or malicious access to sensitive customer, vendor, company, or employee information, as well as to the technology that supports our operations and other business processes.Our business operations rely upon secure systems for site operations, and data capture, processing, storage, and reporting. Although we maintain appropriate data security and controls, our information technology systems, and those of our third-party providers, could become subject to cyberattacks. The result of such attacks could result in a breach of data security and controls. Such a breach of our network, systems, applications or data could result in operational disruptions or damage or information misappropriation including, but not limited to, interruption to systems availability; denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with us; denial of access to the applications we use to plan our operations, procure materials, manufacture and ship products and account for orders; theft of intellectual know-how and trade secrets; and inappropriate disclosure of confidential company, employee, customer or vendor information, could stem from such incidents. In addition, the rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies increases our cybersecurity risks, including generative artificial intelligence augmenting threat actors’ technological sophistication to enhance existing or create new malware.Any of these operational disruptions and/or misappropriation of information could adversely affect our results of operations, create negative publicity, and could have a material effect on our business. While we believe we devote significant resources to network security, disaster recovery, employee training and other measures to secure our information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of data, there are no guarantees that they will be adequate to safeguard against all cyber incidents, systems disruptions, system compromises or misuses of data. In addition, while we currently maintain insurance coverage that, subject to its terms and conditions, is intended to address costs associated with certain aspects of cyber incidents and information systems failures, this insurance coverage may not, depending on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding an incident, cover all losses or all types of claims that arise from an incident, or the damage to our reputation or brands that may result from an incident.We operate in and are subject to taxation from numerous U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.The multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions are subject to significant change. Our effective tax rates could be affected by changes in tax laws or their interpretation, changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates, and changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities.  The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) reached agreement among various countries to implement a minimum 15% tax rate on certain multinational enterprises, commonly referred to as Pillar Two. The minimum tax directive has been adopted by the EU for implementation by its Member States into national legislation effective for fiscal years beginning after 2023 and may be adopted by other jurisdictions including the U.S.  Many countries where we have operations continue to announce changes in their tax laws and regulations based on the Pillar Two principles.  These and other developments could significantly negatively impact the Company’s overall tax expense, results of operations, and future cash flows.In the event any of the above risk factors impact our business in a material way or in combination during the same period, we may be unable to generate enough cash flow to simultaneously fund our operations, finance capital expenditures, and satisfy obligations.In addition to debt service obligations, our business requires expenditures to support growth strategies, research and development initiatives, and for normal upgrades or replacements. We expect to meet all our near and long-term cash needs from a combination of operating cash flow, cash and cash equivalents, availability under our credit facility or other long-term debt. If we are unable to generate enough cash flow from these sources, we could be unable to fund our operations, finance capital expenditures, or satisfy our near and long-term cash needs.We have substantial indebtedness and may incur substantial additional indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to obtain financing in the future, react to changes in our business and make payments on the notes.As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $370.7 million of secured debt and $501.0 million of unsecured debt. We are able to, and may, incur additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to holders of our indebtedness, including:•making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our long-term debt;Table of Contents•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements, and our ability to satisfy our obligations with respect to the notes in the future;•requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes;•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;•limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete;•placing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors or competitors with comparable debt and more favorable terms and thereby affecting our ability to compete; •increasing our cost of borrowing; and•failing to comply with the covenants and other requirements contained in our credit agreements or our other debt instruments could cause an event of default under the relevant debt instrument. Although our borrowing arrangements contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we face would increase, and we may not be able to meet all our debt obligations, including the repayment of the notes. On March 30, 2023, we entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement which obligates us to maintain a leverage ratio under 4.25 to 1.0 through the quarter ended December 31, 2024, stepping down to 4.0 to 1.0 at March 31, 2025, and 3.50 to 1.0 at March 31, 2026 and a debt service coverage ratio less than 1.25 to 1.0 through the quarter ended December 31, 2024, stepping up to 1.50 to 1.0 at March 31, 2025, and 2.00 to 1.0 at March 31, 2026.ESG issues may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, the desirability of our stock, and may damage our reputation.If we are unable to meet our ESG goals or evolving investor, industry, or stakeholder expectations and standards, our customers may choose alternative suppliers and/or our reputation, the desirability of our stock to investors, and our business and/or financial condition may be adversely affected. Any failure to achieve our ESG goals, challenges to our ESG reporting or our failure to effectively respond to new, or changes in, legal or regulatory requirements concerning environmental or other ESG matters could adversely affect our business and thus our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The pending Reverse Morris Trust transaction with Berry’s HHNF Business may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all, and the failure to complete the transaction could adversely impact the market price of Glatfelter common stock, as well as its business and operating results.On February 6, 2024, we entered into certain definitive agreements with Berry, for Berry to spin-off and merge the majority of its Health, Hygiene and Specialties segment including its Global Nonwovens and Films business (“HHNF”) with Glatfelter (the “Merger”). Immediately following the transaction, pre-merger holders of the shares of common stock of Glatfelter will own, in the aggregate, approximately 10% of the outstanding capital stock of Glatfelter and Berry stockholders will own, in the aggregate, approximately 90% of the outstanding capital stock of Glatfelter. The consummation of the transaction is subject to certain conditions, including: (i) approval of the required transactions by Glatfelter’s shareholders; (ii) the effectiveness of the registration statements with the SEC registering the issuance of Glatfelter common stock (iii) the listing of Glatfelter common stock issuable to shareholders on the NYSE; (iv) receipt of applicable regulatory approvals, including the expiration or early termination of the statutory waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and other required regulatory approvals, and (v) the receipt of a private letter ruling from the IRS to the effect that the transactions will qualify for tax-free treatment under the Code, among other customary conditions to closing. There is no assurance that these conditions will be met or waived or that the transaction will be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all.If the transaction is not completed for any reason, the price of Glatfelter common stock could decline. Glatfelter also could experience negative reactions from employees, customers, suppliers or other third parties if the transaction is not completed.GLATFELTER 2023 FORM 10-K13Table of ContentsGlatfelter and Berry have expended and will continue to expend significant management time and resources and have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses related to the transaction, including legal, advisory, and financial services fees. Even if the transaction is completed, any delay in the completion of the transaction could diminish the anticipated benefits of the transaction or result in additional transaction expenses, loss of revenue or other effects associated with uncertainty about the transaction. If the transaction is not consummated because the merger agreement is terminated, Glatfelter may be required under certain circumstances to pay Berry a termination fee of $10 million"
13,GLT,GLATFELTER,2023-02-27,"ITEM 1A    RISK FACTORSOur business and financial performance may be adversely affected by a weak global economic environment or downturns in the target markets that we serve.Adverse global economic conditions could impact our target markets resulting in decreased demand for our products. Our results could be adversely affected if economic conditions weaken. Also, there may be periods during which demand for our products is insufficient to enable us to operate our production facilities at full capacity and in an economical manner which may force us to take machine downtime to curtail production to match demand. Approximately 41% of our net sales in 2022 was from shipments to customers in Europe, the demand for which is dependent on economic conditions in this area, or to the extent such customers do business outside of Europe, in other regions of the world. Uncertain economic conditions in this region may cause weakness in demand for our products, as well as volatility in our customers buying patterns. The cost of raw materials and energy used to manufacture our products could increase or the availability of certain raw materials could become constrained.We require access to sufficient, and reasonably priced, quantities of pulps, pulp substitutes, abaca fiber, polyester and various synthetic fibers, and certain other raw materials, as well as access to reliable and abundant supplies of water to support many of our production facilities. We require significant quantities of wood pulps and, therefore, the volatility of wood pulp prices can have a significant impact on our results of operations.Our Philippine production site purchases raw abaca fiber to produce abaca pulp, a key material used to manufacture material for single-serve coffee, tea, and technical specialty products at Composite Fibers’ facilities. At certain times, the supply of abaca fiber has been constrained or the quality diminished due to factors such as weather-related damage to the source crop, as well as decisions by landowners to produce alternative crops in lieu of those used to produce abaca fiber.

If price adjustments significantly trail increases in raw materials, our operating results could be adversely affected.GLATFELTER 2022 FORM 10-K7Table of ContentsWe may not realize the growth opportunities and operational synergies that are anticipated from the Jacob Holm acquisition.The benefits that we expect to result from the Jacob Holm acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize anticipated growth opportunities and anticipated operational synergies. Our success in realizing these growth opportunities and operational synergies, and the timing of this realization, will depend in part on the successful integration of the Jacob Holm business, the price and availability of certain raw materials and energy at reasonable prices, customers willingness to pay for these increases, and the overall competitive landscape.There is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating acquisitions as sizable as the Jacob Holm acquisition. The process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, our Jacob Holm business. Members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage our company, service existing customers, attract new customers, and develop new products or strategies. If senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer.We cannot assure you that we will successfully or cost-effectively integrate Jacob Holm’s business. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Even if we are able to integrate Jacob Holm’s business successfully, this integration may not result in the realization of the growth opportunities and operational synergies that we expected from this integration, and we cannot guarantee that these benefits will be achieved within the anticipated timeframes or at all.We have substantial indebtedness and may incur substantial additional indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to obtain financing in the future, react to changes in our business and make payments on the notes.As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $312.3 million of secured debt and $532.0 million of unsecured debt. We are able to, and may, incur additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to holders of our indebtedness, including:•making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our long-term debt;•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements, and our ability to satisfy our obligations with respect to the notes in the future;•requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes;•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;•limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete;•placing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors or competitors with comparable debt and more favorable terms and thereby affecting our ability to compete; and•increasing our cost of borrowing.Although our borrowing arrangements contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we  face would increase, and we may not be able to meet all our debt obligations, including the repayment of the notes.The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Approximately $40 and $95 million of our net sales in 2022 and 2021, respectively, or 2.7% and 7.3% of our net sales in 2022 and 2021, respectively, were earned from customers located in Russia and Ukraine. The geopolitical conditions resulting from the Russia/Ukraine military conflict, including government-imposed sanctions and the current macroeconomic climate in Russia and Ukraine, have adversely impacted both demand for our products and our ability to 8Table of Contentsdeliver products to this region, as well as, limited customers' access to financial resources and their ability to satisfy obligations to us. For example, as a direct result of the military conflict, economic sanctions, and the disruptions in the region’s financial systems, we have had a significant reduction in wallcover revenues and cash flows. We expect this reduction to continue for the foreseeable future and most directly impact our facility located in Dresden, Germany that produces wallcover paper, a significant portion of which historically was sold into the Ukraine and Russian markets. Certain wallcover base paper, together with certain filtration products produced by our Composite Fibers segment, are subject to sanction restrictions and currently are unable to be sold into the Russian market. As a result, during the first quarter of 2022, we recorded a $117.3 million non-cash asset impairment charge related to assets of our Dresden facility and an impairment of our Composite Fibers business' goodwill. Moreover, certain customers have not been able to satisfy outstanding accounts receivables and, as such, during 2022, we recognized bad debt expense of approximately $2.9 million directly related to Russian and Ukrainian customers. At December 31, 2022, we had accounts receivable, net of reserves, from customers in this region totaling approximately $0.3 million which we expect to collect in normal course.In addition, we operate manufacturing sites elsewhere in Europe that have been adversely impacted as a result of the military conflict in Ukraine and related geopolitical events and sanctions. In many instances, these sites depend on the availability of natural gas for use in the production of products. The supply of a substantial portion of the natural gas used may originate from Russia. We expect that shortages or variability in supply along with increases and variability in costs of natural gas will adversely impact our ability to operate these sites in an efficient and cost-effective manner, for the foreseeable future. The risk of cyber-security incidents and cyber attacks has increased in connection with the ongoing conflict, driven by justifications such as retaliation for the sanctions imposed in conjunction with the conflict. It is possible that such incidents or attacks could have collateral effects on additional critical infrastructure and financial institutions globally, which could adversely affect our operations and could increase the frequency and severity of cyber-based attacks against our information technology systems. The proliferation of malware from the conflict, into systems unrelated to the conflict, or cyberattacks against U.S. companies in retaliation for U.S. sanctions against Russia or U.S. support of Ukraine, could also adversely affect our operations and our supply chain.In the event that current geopolitical tensions fail to abate, or deteriorate further, or additional governmental sanctions are enacted against the Russian economy or its banking and monetary systems, we may face additional adverse consequences to our business and results of operations. Even if the conflict moderates or a resolution between Ukraine and Russia is reached, we expect that we will continue to experience ongoing adverse consequences to our business, financial condition, and results of operation resulting from the conflict for the foreseeable future, including and because certain of the economic and other sanctions imposed, or that may be imposed, against Russia may continue for a period of time after any resolution has been reached.Disruption of our global supply chain could adversely affect our business.Our ability to manufacture, sell and distribute products is critical to our operations. Our products contain raw materials that we source globally from suppliers. If there is a shortage of a key material in our supply chain, and a replacement cannot be readily sourced from an alternative supplier, the shortage may disrupt our production. Likewise, disruptions in the transportation and delivery of products - both from suppliers to our production facilities, and from our production facilities to our customers - may impact our ability to sell product and deliver goods to our customers on time. In addition, the costs of transporting materials and products through our chain of sourcing and production may increase, and such increases could be significant. The failure of third parties on which we rely, including those third parties who supply our raw materials, packaging, capital equipment and other necessary operating materials, contract manufacturers, commercial transport, distributors, contractors, and external business partners, to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, may negatively impact our operations. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such disruptions, or to effectively manage such disruptions if they occur, could adversely affect our business and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore our global supply chain. Any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.A significant proportion of our net sale and earnings is generated from operations outside of the United States. In addition, we own and operate manufacturing facilities in Canada, Germany, France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the Philippines. A significant portion of our business is transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar including the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Philippine peso, among others. Our euro denominated net sales exceeds euro expenses by an estimated €190 million. With respect to the British pound, Canadian dollar, and Philippine peso, we have greater outflows than inflows of these currencies, although to a lesser degree than the euro. As a result, we are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates and such changes could be significant.GLATFELTER 2022 FORM 10-K9Table of ContentsOur ability to maintain our products' price competitiveness is reliant, in part, on the relative strength of the currency in which the product is denominated compared to the currency of the market into which it is sold and the functional currency of our competitors. Changes in the rate of exchange of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar, and other currencies, may adversely impact our results of operations and our ability to offer products in certain markets at acceptable prices. In the event of significant currency weakening in the countries into which our products are sold, demand for our products, pricing of our products, or a customer’s ability to satisfy obligations to us, could be adversely impacted. Our industry is highly competitive and increased competition could reduce our sales and profitability.The global markets in which we compete are served by a variety of competitors and a variety of substrates. As a result, our ability to compete is sensitive to, and may be adversely impacted by: •the entry of new competitors into the markets we serve;•the aggressiveness of our competitors’ pricing strategies, which could force us to decrease prices in order to maintain market share;•our failure to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences; and•technological advances or changes that impact production or cost competitiveness of our products.The impact of any significant changes may result in our inability to effectively compete in the markets in which we operate, and as a result our sales and operating results would be adversely affected.We may not be able to develop new products acceptable to our existing or potential customers.Our business strategy is market focused and includes investments in developing new products to meet the changing needs of our customers, serve new customers and to maintain our market share. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop and introduce new and enhanced products that keep pace with introductions by our competitors and changing customer preferences. If we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to these factors, we may lose opportunities for business with both current and potential customers. The success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors, including our ability to:•anticipate and properly identify our customers' needs and industry trends;•develop and commercialize new products and applications in a timely manner;•price our products competitively;•differentiate our products from our competitors' products; and•invest efficiently in research and development activities.Our inability to develop new products or new business opportunities could adversely impact our business and ultimately harm our profitability.We are subject to substantial costs and potential liability for environmental matters.We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations, including discharges into the environment, and the handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. We are also subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and clean-up responsibility for releases of hazardous substances. To comply with environmental laws and regulations, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial expenditures. We may incur obligations to remove or mitigate any adverse effects on the environment, such as air and water quality, resulting from mills we operate or have operated. Potential obligations include costs for government oversight of the remediation activities, the restoration of natural resources, and/or personal injury and property damages. We generate a substantial portion of Airlaid Materials' and Spunlace's  net sales from a few large customers, the loss of any one could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.The top three customers in each segment, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 53% of Airlaid Materials’ and approximately 39% of Spunlace’s net sales in 2022. Furthermore, Airlaid Materials and Spunlace derive approximately 40% and 6%, respectively, of their annual net sales from sales to the feminine hygiene market.  The loss of any one of these large customers or a decline in sales of hygiene products could have a material adverse effect on these segments’ operating results. Our ability to effectively compete could be affected by technological production alternatives which could provide substitute products into this market segment. Customers in the airlaid and spunlace nonwoven fabric material market, including the hygiene market, may also switch to less expensive products, change preferences or otherwise reduce 10Table of Contentsdemand for our products, thus reducing the size of the markets in which the segments currently sell their products. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and business prospects.Our operations may be impaired, and we may be exposed to potential losses and liability as a result of natural disasters, acts of terrorism or sabotage or similar events.If we have a catastrophic loss or unforeseen operational disruption at any of our facilities, we could suffer significant lost production which could impair our ability to satisfy customer demands.Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, typhoons, flooding or fire, and acts of terrorism or sabotage affecting our operating activities and major facilities could materially and adversely affect our operations, operating results and financial condition.In addition, many of our operations require a reliable and abundant supply of water. Such sites rely on local bodies of water or water sources for their production needs and, therefore, are particularly sensitive to drought conditions or other natural or man-made interruptions to water supplies. Any interruption or curtailment of operations at any of our production facilities due to drought or low flow conditions at the principal water source or another cause could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.Our pulp facility in Lanao del Norte on the Island of Mindanao in the Republic of the Philippines is located along the Pacific Rim, one of the world’s hazard belts. By virtue of its geographic location, this site is subject to similar types of natural disasters discussed above, cyclones, typhoons, and volcanic activity. Moreover, the area of Lanao del Norte has been a target of suspected terrorist activities. Our pulp mill in Mindanao is located in a rural portion of the island and is susceptible to attacks and/or power interruptions. The Mindanao site supplies the abaca pulp used by Composite Fibers to manufacture paper for single serve coffee and tea products and certain technical specialties products. Any interruption, loss, or extended curtailment of operations at our Mindanao site could affect our ability to meet customer demands for our products and materially affect our operating results and financial condition.We have operations in a potentially politically and economically unstable location.Our pulp facility in the Philippines is located in a region that is unstable and subject to political unrest. As discussed above, our Philippine pulp facility produces abaca pulp, a significant raw material used by Composite Fibers and is currently our main source of abaca pulp. There are limited suitable alternative sources of readily available abaca pulp in the world. In the event of a disruption in supply from our Philippine site, there is no guarantee that we could obtain adequate amounts of abaca pulp, if at all, from alternative sources at a reasonable price. Further, there is no assurance the performance of such alternative materials will satisfy customer performance requirements. As a consequence, any civil disturbance, unrest, political instability, or other event that causes a disruption in supply could limit the availability of abaca pulp and would increase our cost of obtaining abaca pulp. Such occurrences could adversely impact our sales volumes, net sales, and operating results.Our international operations pose certain risks that may adversely impact sales and earnings.We have significant operations and assets located in Canada, Germany, France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the Philippines. Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of unique risks, in addition to the risks in our domestic sales and operations, including, but not limited to, economic and trade disruptions resulting from geopolitical developments, differing protections of intellectual property, trade barriers, labor unrest, exchange controls, regional economic uncertainty, differing (and possibly more stringent) labor regulation, risk of governmental expropriation, domestic and foreign customs and tariffs, differing regulatory environments, difficulty in managing widespread operations and political instability. These factors may adversely affect our future profits. Also, in some foreign jurisdictions, we may be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remit earnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met. Any such limitations would restrict our flexibility in using funds generated in those jurisdictions.We are subject to cyber-security risks related to unauthorized or malicious access to sensitive customer, vendor, company, or employee information, as well as to the technology that supports our operations and other business processes.Our business operations rely upon secure systems for site operations, and data capture, processing, storage, and reporting. Although we maintain appropriate data security and controls, our information technology systems, and those of our third-party providers, could become subject to cyberattacks. Systems such as ours are inherently exposed to cyber-security risks and potential attacks. The result of such attacks could result in a breach of data security and controls. Such a breach of our network, systems, applications or data could result in operational disruptions or damage or information GLATFELTER 2022 FORM 10-K11Table of Contentsmisappropriation including, but not limited to, interruption to systems availability, denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with us, denial of access to the applications we use to plan our operations, procure materials, manufacture and ship products and account for orders, theft of intellectual know-how and trade secrets, and inappropriate disclosure of confidential company, employee, customer or vendor information, could stem from such incidents.Any of these operational disruptions and/or misappropriation of information could adversely affect our results of operations, create negative publicity, and could have a material effect on our business.We operate in and are subject to taxation from numerous U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.The multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions are subject to significant change. Our effective tax rates could be affected by changes in tax laws or their interpretation, changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates, and changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Also, many jurisdictions continue to adopt tax policies in response to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) anti-Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”) project. For example, in July of 2021, 130 countries agreed in principle to a framework of international taxation proposed by the OECD that would change the rules of how profit is allocated among countries and impose a global minimum tax rate. These and other developments could significantly negatively impact the Company’s overall tax expense, results of operations, and future cash flows.In the event any of the above risk factors impact our business in a material way or in combination during the same period, we may be unable to generate enough cash flow to simultaneously fund our operations, finance capital expenditures, satisfy obligations, and make dividend payments on our common stock.In addition to debt service obligations, our business requires expenditures to support growth strategies, research and development initiatives, and for normal upgrades or replacements. We expect to meet all our near and long-term cash needs from a combination of operating cash flow, cash and cash equivalents, availability under our credit facility or other long-term debt. If we are unable to generate enough cash flow from these sources, we could be unable to fund our operations, finance capital expenditures, satisfy our near and long-term cash needs or make dividend payments"
1,GLT,GLATFELTER,2022-02-25,"ITEM 1A    RISK FACTORSOur business and financial performance may be adversely affected by a weak global economic environment or downturns in the target markets that we serve.Adverse global economic conditions could impact our target markets resulting in decreased demand for our products. Our results could be adversely affected if economic conditions weaken. Also, there may be periods during which demand for our products is insufficient to enable us to operate our production facilities at full capacity and in an economical manner which may force us to take machine downtime to curtail production to match demand. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic as the virus spread throughout the world. As the virus, and variants thereof, continued its rapid spread, a significant portion of the world’s economies was adversely impacted, and may continue to be so from time to time, by government mandates intending to slow or reduce the virus' reach such as i) reduced operation of  “non-essential” businesses; ii)  “social distancing”; and iii) vaccine mandates. The actions undertaken across the globe in an attempt to contain the spread of the virus have had an unprecedented and significant adverse impact on global economies in terms of reduced GDP, disruptions in global supply chains, increased unemployment, and insolvencies in a variety of industries and markets.The majority of our product portfolios are considered to be “essential or life-sustaining” and we continued to produce products used in the global response effort to the pandemic. However, shortly after the pandemic began and through the first several months of 2021, our financial performance and results of operations were impacted by the pandemic, particularly by weaker demand for tabletop products used by restaurants, catering and similar venues, all of which were impacted by “lockdowns” throughout many regions of the world. In the event economic activity continues to be adversely impacted, or the impact intensifies, due to the spread of COVID-19 or due to actions to control the spread, we could be forced to curtail operations further due to reduced customer demand, compliance with government mandates or the inability to adequately staff production facilities due to a widespread or sustained outbreak of COVID-19 at one or more of our facilities. In addition, our global supply chain could be disrupted, demand for our products, or the prices the products are sold, could be adversely impacted if economic conditions in the target markets that we serve remain weak or weaken further. We also could face potential legal actions that could arise due to our operations during the pandemic. This economic environment may also cause customer insolvencies which may result in their inability to satisfy their financial obligations to us. The conditions are beyond our control and may have a significant impact on our sales and results of operations.In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on various economies throughout the world could lead to financial instabilities or insolvencies of some of our customers or the customers they in turn serve which could impact our ability to sell our products. These conditions are beyond our control and may have a significant impact on our sales and results of operations. As we cannot predict the duration or scope of the COVID-19 pandemic, in the event the spread continues or the government actions intensify, our results of operations and/or financial position could be adversely impacted.Approximately 52% of our net sales in 2021 was from shipments to customers in Europe, the demand for which is dependent on economic conditions in this area, or to the extent such customers do business outside of Europe, in other regions of the world. Uncertain economic conditions in this region may cause weakness in demand for our products, as well as volatility in our customers buying patterns. Disruption of our global supply chain could adversely affect our business.Our ability to manufacture, sell and distribute products is critical to our operations. Our products contain raw materials that we source globally from suppliers. If there is a shortage of a key material in our supply chain, and a replacement cannot be readily sourced from an alternative supplier, the shortage may disrupt our production. Likewise, disruptions in the transportation and delivery of products - both from suppliers to our production facilities, and from our production facilities to our customers - may impact our ability to sell product and deliver goods to our customers on time. GLATFELTER 2021 FORM 10-K7Table of ContentsIn addition, the costs of transporting materials and products through our chain of sourcing and production may increase, and such increases could be significant. The failure of third parties on which we rely, including those third parties who supply our raw materials, packaging, capital equipment and other necessary operating materials, contract manufacturers, commercial transport, distributors, contractors, and external business partners, to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, may negatively impact our operations. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such disruptions, or to effectively manage such disruptions if they occur, could adversely affect our business and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore our global supply chain. Any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.The cost of raw materials and energy used to manufacture our products could increase or the availability of certain raw materials could become constrained.We require access to sufficient, and reasonably priced, quantities of pulps, pulp substitutes, abaca fiber, polyester or synthetic fibers, and certain other raw materials, as well as access to reliable and abundant supplies of water to support many of our production facilities. We require significant quantities of wood pulps and, therefore, the volatility of wood pulp prices can have a significant impact on our results of operations.Our Philippine production site purchases abaca fiber to produce abaca pulp, a key material used to manufacture paper for single-serve coffee, tea, and technical specialty products at Composite Fibers’ facilities. At certain times, the supply of abaca fiber has been constrained or the quality diminished due to factors such as weather-related damage to the source crop, as well as decisions by landowners to produce alternative crops in lieu of those used to produce abaca fiber. These factors have contributed to volatility in fiber prices or limited available supply.Airlaid Materials requires access to sufficient quantities of fluff pulp, the supply of which is subject to availability of certain softwoods. The cost of many of our production materials, including petroleum-based chemicals and freight charges, are influenced by the cost of oil. Natural gas is the principal source of fuel for each of our facilities worldwide and has historically been more volatile than other fuels. Government rules, regulations and policies have an impact on the cost of certain energy sources, particularly for our European operations. In Europe, we currently benefit from a number of government-sponsored programs related to, among others, green energy or renewable energy initiatives designed to mitigate the cost of electricity to larger industrial consumers of power. Any reduction in the extent of government sponsored incentives may adversely affect the cost ultimately borne by our operations. Although we have contractual arrangements with certain Airlaid Materials and Spunlace customers pursuant to which our product’s selling price is adjusted for changes in the cost of certain raw materials, we may not be able to fully pass increased raw materials or energy costs on to all customers if the market will not bear the higher price or if existing agreements limit price increases. If price adjustments significantly trail increases in raw materials, our operating results could be adversely affected.Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.A significant proportion of our net sale and earnings is generated from operations outside of the United States. In addition, we own and operate manufacturing facilities in Canada, Germany, France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the Philippines. A significant portion of our business is transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar including the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Philippine peso, among others. Our euro denominated net sales exceeds euro expenses by an estimated €150 million. With respect to the British pound, Canadian dollar, and Philippine peso, we have greater outflows than inflows of these currencies, although to a lesser degree than the euro. As a result, we are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates and such changes could be significant.Our ability to maintain our products' price competitiveness is reliant, in part, on the relative strength of the currency in which the product is denominated compared to the currency of the market into which it is sold and the functional currency of our competitors. Changes in the rate of exchange of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar, and other currencies, may adversely impact our results of operations and our ability to offer products in certain markets at acceptable prices. In the event of significant currency weakening in the countries into which our products are sold, demand for our products, pricing of our products, or a customer’s ability to satisfy obligations to us, could be adversely impacted. 8Table of ContentsThe conflict between Russia and Ukraine could adversely affect our results of operations.Approximately $95 million of our net sales in 2021 was earned from customers located in Russia and Ukraine. Uncertain geopolitical conditions, the invasion of Ukraine, sanctions, and other potential impacts on this region’s economic environment and currencies may cause demand for our products to be volatile, cause abrupt changes in our customers' buying patterns, interrupt our ability to supply products to this region or limit customers' access to financial resources and ability to satisfy obligations to us.In addition, we operate manufacturing sites throughout Europe, including Germany, France, Spain and the United Kingdom. In many instances, these sites depend on the availability of natural gas for use in the production of products. The supply of a substantial portion of the natural gas used may originate from Russia.In the event geopolitical tensions fail to abate or deteriorate further, additional governmental sanctions may be enacted adversely impacting this region's economy, its banking and monetary systems, markets or customers for our products, or the supply and cost of natural gas used by our sites.Our industry is highly competitive and increased competition could reduce our sales and profitability.The global markets in which we compete are served by a variety of competitors and a variety of substrates. As a result, our ability to compete is sensitive to, and may be adversely impacted by: •the entry of new competitors into the markets we serve;•the aggressiveness of our competitors’ pricing strategies, which could force us to decrease prices in order to maintain market share;•our failure to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences; and•technological advances or changes that impact production or cost competitiveness of our products.The impact of any significant changes may result in our inability to effectively compete in the markets in which we operate, and as a result our sales and operating results would be adversely affected.We may not be able to develop new products acceptable to our existing or potential customers.Our business strategy is market focused and includes investments in developing new products to meet the changing needs of our customers, serve new customers and to maintain our market share.

We are also subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and clean-up responsibility for releases of hazardous substances. To comply with environmental laws and regulations, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial expenditures. We may incur obligations to remove or mitigate any adverse effects on the environment, such as air and water quality, resulting from mills we operate or have operated. Potential obligations include costs for government oversight of the remediation activities, the restoration of natural resources, and/or personal injury and property damages. We generate a substantial portion of Airlaid Materials' and Spunlace's  net sales from one customer serving the hygiene products market, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Airlaid Materials and Spunlace derive approximately 44% and 6% respectively, of their annual net sales from sales to the feminine hygiene market. In addition, one customer accounted for 36% of Airlaid Materials' and 11% of GLATFELTER 2021 FORM 10-K9Table of ContentsSpunlace's sales. The balance is concentrated with a small group of large customers. The loss of this one large customer or a decline in sales of hygiene products could have a material adverse effect on these segment's operating results. Our ability to effectively compete could be affected by technological production alternatives which could provide substitute products into this market segment. Customers in the airlaid and spunlace nonwoven fabric material market, including the hygiene market, may also switch to less expensive products, change preferences or otherwise reduce demand for our products, thus reducing the size of the markets in which the segments currently sell their products. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and business prospects.Our operations may be impaired, and we may be exposed to potential losses and liability as a result of natural disasters, acts of terrorism or sabotage or similar events.If we have a catastrophic loss or unforeseen operational disruption at any of our facilities, we could suffer significant lost production which could impair our ability to satisfy customer demands.Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, typhoons, flooding or fire, and acts of terrorism or sabotage affecting our operating activities and major facilities could materially and adversely affect our operations, operating results and financial condition.In addition, many of our operations require a reliable and abundant supply of water.

If we are unable to generate enough cash flow from these sources, we could be unable to fund our operations, finance capital expenditures, satisfy our near and long-term cash needs or make dividend payments.We may not realize the growth opportunities and operational synergies that are anticipated from the JacobHolm acquisition and the Mount Holly acquisition.The benefits that we expect to result from the Jacob Holm acquisition and the Mount Holly acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize anticipated growth opportunities and operational synergies. Our success in realizing these growth opportunities and operational synergies, and the timing of this realization, will depend in part on the successful integration of the Mount Holly and Jacob Holm businesses.There is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating acquisitions as sizable as the Jacob Holm acquisition and the Mount Holly acquisition. The process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, our Mount Holly’s or Jacob Holm’s business. Members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage our company, service existing customers, attract new customers and develop new products or strategies. If senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer.We cannot assure you that we will successfully or cost-effectively integrate Mount Holly’s or Jacob Holm’s business or at all. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Even if we are able to integrate Mount Holly’s or Jacob Holm’s business successfully, this integration may not result in the realization of the growth opportunities and operational synergies that we currently expect from this integration, and we cannot guarantee that these benefits will be achieved within anticipated timeframes or at all.GLATFELTER 2021 FORM 10-K11Table of ContentsWe have substantial indebtedness and may incur substantial additional indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to obtain financing in the future, react to changes in our business and make payments on the notes.As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $787.4 million of senior unsecured debt and $118.3 million of revolving commitments available under our Credit Facility (after giving effect to $6.7 million of outstanding undrawn letters of credit). We are able to, and may, incur additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to holders of our indebtedness, including:•making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our long-term debt;•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements and our ability to satisfy our obligations with respect to the notes in the future;•requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including under the Credit Facility, are at variable rates of interest;•limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete;•placing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors or competitors with comparable debt and more favorable terms and thereby affecting our ability to compete; and•increasing our cost of borrowing.Although our borrowing arrangements contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we  face would increase, and we may not be able to meet all our debt obligations, including the repayment of the notes"
0,GLT,GLATFELTER,2021-02-25,"ITEM 1ARISK FACTORSOur business and financial performance may be adversely affected by a weak global economic environment or downturns in the target markets that we serve.Adverse global economic conditions could impact our target markets resulting in decreased demand for our products. Our results could be adversely affected if economic conditions weaken. Also, there may be periods during which demand for our products is insufficient to enable us to operate our production facilities at full capacity and in an economical manner which may force us to take machine downtime to curtail production to match demand. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic as the virus spread throughout the world. As the virus continued its rapid spread, a significant portion of the world’s economies was significantly impacted, and will continue to be so, by government mandates that all “non-essential” businesses close and that residents “shelter-in-place” or practice “social distancing.” The actions undertaken across the globe in an attempt to contain the spread of the virus have had an unprecedented and significant adverse impact on global economies in terms of reduced GDP, increased unemployment, and insolvencies in a variety of industries and markets.In the event economic activity continues to be adversely impacted, or the impact intensifies, due to the spread of COVID-19 or due to actions to control the spread, we could be forced to curtail operations further due to reduced customer demand, compliance with government mandates or the inability to adequately staff production facilities due to a widespread or sustained outbreak of COVID-19 at one or more of our facilities. In addition, our global supply chain could be disrupted, demand for our products, or the prices the products are sold, could be adversely impacted if economic conditions in the target markets that we serve remain weak or weaken further. We also could face potential legal actions that could arise due to our operations during the pandemic. This economic environment may also cause customer insolvencies which may result in their inability to satisfy their financial obligations to us. The conditions are beyond our control and may have a significant impact on our sales and results of operations.In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on various economies throughout the world could lead to financial instabilities or insolvencies of some of our customers or the customers they in turn serve which could impact our ability to sell our products. These conditions are beyond our control and may have a significant impact on our sales and results of operations. As we cannot predict the duration or scope of the COVID-19 pandemic, in the event the spread continues or the government actions intensify, our results of operations and/or financial position could be adversely impacted.Approximately 55% of our net sales in 2020 was from shipments to customers in Europe, the demand for which is dependent on economic conditions in this area, or to the extent such customers do business outside of Europe, in other regions of the world. Uncertain economic conditions in this region may cause weakness in demand for our products as well as volatility in our customers buying patterns. The cost of raw materials and energy used to manufacture our products could increase or the availability of certain raw materials could become constrained.We require access to sufficient, and reasonably priced, quantities of pulps, pulp substitutes, abaca fiber, synthetic fibers, and certain other raw materials, as well as access to reliable and abundant supplies of water to support many of our 6production facilities. We require significant quantities of wood pulps and, therefore, the volatility of wood pulp prices can have a significant impact on our results of operations.Our Philippine mill purchases abaca fiber to produce abaca pulp, a key material used to manufacture paper for single-serve coffee, tea, and technical specialty products at Composite Fibers’ facilities. At certain times, the supply of abaca fiber has been constrained or the quality diminished due to factors such as weather-related damage to the source crop as well as decisions by landowners to produce alternative crops in lieu of those used to produce abaca fiber. These factors have contributed to volatility in fiber prices or limited available supply.Airlaid Materials requires access to sufficient quantities of fluff pulp, the supply of which is subject to availability of certain softwoods. The cost of many of our production materials, including petroleum-based chemicals and freight charges, are influenced by the cost of oil. Natural gas is the principal source of fuel for each of our facilities worldwide and has historically been more volatile than other fuels. Government rules, regulations and policies have an impact on the cost of certain energy sources, particularly for our European operations. In Europe, we currently benefit from a number of government-sponsored programs related to, among others, green energy or renewable energy initiatives designed to mitigate the cost of electricity to larger industrial consumers of power. Any reduction in the extent of government sponsored incentives may adversely affect the cost ultimately borne by our operations. Although we have contractual arrangements with certain Airlaid Materials customers pursuant to which our product’s selling price is adjusted for changes in the cost of certain raw materials, we may not be able to fully pass increased raw materials or energy costs on to all customers if the market will not bear the higher price or if existing agreements limit price increases. If price adjustments significantly trail increases in raw materials or energy prices, our operating results could be adversely affected.Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.A significant proportion of our net sale and earnings is generated from operations outside of the United States. In addition, we own and operate manufacturing facilities in Canada, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and the Philippines. A significant portion of our business is transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar including the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Philippine peso, among others. Our euro denominated net sales exceeds euro expenses by an estimated €150 million. With respect to the British pound, Canadian dollar, and Philippine peso, we have greater outflows than inflows of these currencies, although to a lesser degree than the euro. As a result, we are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates and such changes could be significant.Our ability to maintain our products' price competitiveness is reliant, in part, on the relative strength of the currency in which the product is denominated compared to the currency of the market into which it is sold and the functional currency of our competitors. Changes in the rate of exchange of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar, and other currencies, may adversely impact our results of operations and our ability to offer products in certain markets at acceptable prices. In the event of significant currency weakening in the countries into which our products are sold, demand for our products, pricing of our products, or a customer’s ability to satisfy obligations to us, could be adversely impacted. Approximately $79 million of our net sales in 2020 was earned from customers located in Ukraine and Russia. Uncertain geo-political conditions, this region’s economic environment and volatile currencies may cause demand for our products to be volatile and cause abrupt changes in our customers buying patterns.Our industry is highly competitive and increased competition could reduce our sales and profitability.The global markets in which we compete are served by a variety of competitors and a variety of substrates. As a result, our ability to compete is sensitive to, and may be adversely impacted by:  •the entry of new competitors into the markets we serve; •the aggressiveness of our competitors’ pricing strategies, which could force us to decrease prices in order to maintain market share; •our failure to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences; and •technological advances or changes that impact production or cost competitiveness of our products.The impact of any significant changes may result in our inability to effectively compete in the markets in which we operate, and as a result our sales and operating results would be adversely affected. GLATFELTER 2020 FORM 10-K7 We may not be able to develop new products acceptable to our existing or potential customers.Our business strategy is market focused and includes investments in developing new products to meet the changing needs of our customers, serve new customers and to maintain our market share. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop and introduce new and enhanced products that keep pace with introductions by our competitors and changing customer preferences. If we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to these factors, we may lose opportunities for business with both current and potential customers. The success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors, including our ability to: •anticipate and properly identify our customers' needs and industry trends; •develop and commercialize new products and applications in a timely manner; •price our products competitively; •differentiate our products from our competitors' products; and •invest efficiently in research and development activities.Our inability to develop new products or new business opportunities could adversely impact our business and ultimately harm our profitability.We are subject to substantial costs and potential liability for environmental matters.We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations, including discharges into the environment, and the handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. We are also subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and clean-up responsibility for releases of hazardous substances. To comply with environmental laws and regulations, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial expenditures. We may incur obligations to remove or mitigate any adverse effects on the environment, such as air and water quality, resulting from mills we operate or have operated. Potential obligations include costs for government oversight of the remediation activities, the restoration of natural resources, and/or personal injury and property damages. Airlaid Materials generates a substantial portion of its net sales from one customer serving the hygiene products market, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Airlaid Materials’ derives approximately 52% of its net sales from sales to the feminine hygiene market. In addition, one customer accounted for 39% of this segment’s sales, and the balance is concentrated with a small group of large customers. The loss of the large customer or a decline in sales of hygiene products could have a material adverse effect on this business’s operating results. Our ability to effectively compete could be affected by technological production alternatives which could provide substitute products into this market segment. Customers in the airlaid nonwoven fabric material market, including the hygiene market, may also switch to less expensive products, change preferences or otherwise reduce demand for Airlaid Materials’ products, thus reducing the size of the markets in which it currently sells its products. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and business prospects.Our operations may be impaired, and we may be exposed to potential losses and liability as a result of natural disasters, acts of terrorism or sabotage or similar events.If we have a catastrophic loss or unforeseen operational disruption at any of our facilities, we could suffer significant lost production which could impair our ability to satisfy customer demands.Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, typhoons, flooding or fire, and acts of terrorism or sabotage affecting our operating activities and major facilities could materially and adversely affect our operations, operating results and financial condition.8In addition, many of our operations require a reliable and abundant supply of water. Such mills rely on a local water body or water source for their water needs and, therefore, are particularly sensitive to drought conditions or other natural or manmade interruptions to water supplies. Any interruption or curtailment of operations at any of our production facilities due to drought or low flow conditions at the principal water source or another cause could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.Our pulp mill in Lanao del Norte on the Island of Mindanao in the Republic of the Philippines is located along the Pacific Rim, one of the world’s hazard belts. By virtue of its geographic location, this mill is subject to similar types of natural disasters discussed above, cyclones, typhoons, and volcanic activity. Moreover, the area of Lanao del Norte has been a target of suspected terrorist activities. Our pulp mill in Mindanao is located in a rural portion of the island and is susceptible to attacks and/or power interruptions. The Mindanao mill supplies the abaca pulp used by Composite Fibers to manufacture paper for single serve coffee and tea products and certain technical specialties products. Any interruption, loss, or extended curtailment of operations at our Mindanao mill could affect our ability to meet customer demands for our products and materially affect our operating results and financial condition.We have operations in a potentially politically and economically unstable location.Our pulp mill in the Philippines is located in a region that is unstable and subject to political unrest. As discussed above, our Philippine pulp mill produces abaca pulp, a significant raw material used by Composite Fibers and is currently our main source of abaca pulp. There are limited suitable alternative sources of readily available abaca pulp in the world. In the event of a disruption in supply from our Philippine mill, there is no guarantee that we could obtain adequate amounts of abaca pulp, if at all, from alternative sources at a reasonable price. Further, there is no assurance the performance of such alternative materials will satisfy customer performance requirements. As a consequence, any civil disturbance, unrest, political instability, or other event that causes a disruption in supply could limit the availability of abaca pulp and would increase our cost of obtaining abaca pulp. Such occurrences could adversely impact our sales volumes, net sales, and operating results.Our international operations pose certain risks that may adversely impact sales and earnings.We have significant operations and assets located in Canada, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and the Philippines. Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of unique risks, in addition to the risks in our domestic sales and operations, including, but not limited to, economic and trade disruptions resulting from geopolitical developments, differing protections of intellectual property, trade barriers, labor unrest, exchange controls, regional economic uncertainty, differing (and possibly more stringent) labor regulation, risk of governmental expropriation, domestic and foreign customs and tariffs, differing regulatory environments, difficulty in managing widespread operations and political instability. These factors may adversely affect our future profits. Also, in some foreign jurisdictions, we may be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remit earnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met. Any such limitations would restrict our flexibility in using funds generated in those jurisdictions.We are subject to cyber-security risks related to unauthorized or malicious access to sensitive customer, vendor, company, or employee information as well as to the technology that supports our operations and other business processes.Our business operations rely upon secure systems for mill operations, and data capture, processing, storage, and reporting. Although we maintain appropriate data security and controls, our information technology systems, and those of our third-party providers, could become subject to cyberattacks. Systems such as ours are inherently exposed to cyber-security risks and potential attacks. The result of such attacks could result in a breach of data security and controls. Such a breach of our network, systems, applications or data could result in operational disruptions or damage or information misappropriation including, but not limited to, interruption to systems availability, denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with us, denial of access to the applications we use to plan our operations, procure materials, manufacture and ship products and account for orders, theft of intellectual knowhow and trade secrets, and inappropriate disclosure of confidential company, employee, customer or vendor information, could stem from such incidents.Any of these operational disruptions and/or misappropriation of information could adversely affect our results of operations, create negative publicity, and could have a material effect on our business. GLATFELTER 2020 FORM 10-K9 We operate in and are subject to taxation from numerous U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.The multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the U.S and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. Our effective tax rates could be affected by changes in tax laws or their interpretation or changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. For example, the European Commission has opened formal investigations to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in certain European countries comply with European Union rules on state aid. The outcome of the European Commission’s investigations could require changes to existing tax rulings that, in turn, could have an impact on our income taxes and results of operations.In the event any of the above risk factors impact our business in a material way or in combination during the same period, we may be unable to generate enough cash flow to simultaneously fund our operations, finance capital expenditures, satisfy obligations and make dividend payments on our common stock.In addition to debt service obligations, our business requires expenditures to support growth strategies, research and development initiatives, and for normal upgrades or replacements. We expect to meet all our near and long-term cash needs from a combination of operating cash flow, cash and cash equivalents, availability under our credit facility or other long-term debt. If we are unable to generate enough cash flow from these sources, we could be unable to fund our operations, finance capital expenditures, satisfy our near and long-term cash needs or make dividend payments. "

As a result, we are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates and such changes could be significant.In the event that one or more European countries were to replace the euro with another currency, business may be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established.Our ability to maintain our products' price competitiveness is reliant, in part, on the relative strength of the currency in which the product is denominated compared to the currency of the market into which it is sold and the functional currency of our competitors. Changes in the rate of exchange of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar, and other currencies, may adversely impact our results of operations and our ability to offer products in certain markets at acceptable prices. For example, approximately $88 million of our revenue in 2018 was earned from shipments to customers located in Ukraine, Russia and members of the CIS. Although these sales are denominated in euros, a significant weakening of the customers’ local currencies may adversely affect our revenue, our customers’ credit risk and our results of operation.The cost of raw materials and energy used to manufacture our products could increase or the availability of certain raw materials could become constrained.We require access to sufficient, and reasonably priced, quantities of pulps, pulp substitutes, abaca fiber, synthetic fibers, and certain other raw materials, as well as access to reliable and abundant supplies of water to support many of our production facilities. We require significant quantities of wood pulps and, therefore, the volatility of wood pulp prices can have a significant impact on our results of operations.Our Philippine mill purchases abaca fiber to produce abaca pulp, a key material used to manufacture paper for single-serve coffee, tea and technical specialty products at Composite Fibers’ facilities. At certain times, the supply of abaca fiber has been constrained or the quality diminished due to factors such as weather-related damage to the source crop as well as decisions by land owners to produce alternative crops in lieu of those used to produce abaca fiber. These factors have contributed to volatility in fiber prices or limited available supply.Advanced Airlaid requires access to sufficient quantities of fluff pulp, the supply of which is subject to availability of certain softwoods. The cost of many of our production materials, including petroleum-based chemicals and freight charges, are influenced by the cost of oil. Natural gas is the principal source of fuel for each of our facilities worldwide and has historically been more volatile than other fuels. More recently, Europe has experienced a sharp rise in the price of electricity. GLATFELTER 2018 FORM 10-K5 Government rules, regulations and policies have an impact on the cost of certain energy sources, particularly for our European operations. In Europe, we currently benefit from a number of government-sponsored programs related to, among others, green energy or renewable energy initiatives designed to mitigate the cost of electricity to larger industrial consumers of power. Any reduction in the extent of government sponsored incentives may adversely affect the cost ultimately borne by our operations. Furthermore, the European Commission is investigating certain energy programs in Germany from which we benefit as to whether the programs comply with European Union rules on state aid. The outcome of these investigations could require us to return certain benefits previously earned or reduce such benefits in the future and could impact our results of operations.Although we have contractual arrangements with certain Advanced Airlaid customers pursuant to which our product’s selling price is adjusted for changes in the cost of certain raw materials, we may not be able to fully pass increased raw materials or energy costs on to all customers if the market will not bear the higher price or if existing agreements limit price increases. If price adjustments significantly trail increases in raw materials or energy prices, our operating results could be adversely affected.Our industry is highly competitive and increased competition could reduce our sales and profitability.The global markets in which we compete, although growing, are served by a variety of competitors. As a result, our ability to compete is sensitive to, and may be adversely impacted by, the following:  •the entry of new competitors into the markets we serve; •the aggressiveness of our competitors’ pricing strategies, which could force us to decrease prices in order to maintain market share; •our failure to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences; and •technological advances or changes that impact production or cost competitiveness of our products.The impact of any significant changes may result in our inability to effectively compete in the markets in which we operate, and as a result our sales and operating results would be adversely affected.We may not be able to develop new products acceptable to our existing or potential customers.Our business strategy is market focused and includes investments in developing new products to meet the changing needs of our customers, serve new customers and to maintain our market share. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop and introduce new and enhanced products that keep pace with introductions by our competitors and changing customer preferences. If we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to these factors, we may lose opportunities for business with both current and potential customers. The success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors, including our ability to: •anticipate and properly identify our customers' needs and industry trends; •develop and commercialize new products and applications in a timely manner; •price our products competitively; •differentiate our products from our competitors' products; and •invest efficiently in research and development activities.Our inability to develop new products or new business opportunities could adversely impact our business and ultimately harm our profitability.6We are subject to substantial costs and potential liability for environmental matters.We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations, including discharges into the environment, and the handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. We are also subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and clean-up responsibility for releases of hazardous substances. To comply with environmental laws and regulations, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial capital and operating expenditures. We may incur obligations to remove or mitigate any adverse effects on the environment, such as air and water quality, resulting from mills we operate or have operated. Potential obligations include compensation for the restoration of natural resources, personal injury and property damages. We have exposure to potential liability for remediation and other costs related to the presence of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the lower Fox River on which our former Neenah, Wisconsin mill was located. As more fully discussed in Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 21, this is a complex matter and has involved several years of litigation. In January 2019, we entered into a consent decree with government agencies which we believe resolves our liability for the site.Advanced Airlaid generates a substantial portion of its revenue from one customer serving the hygiene products market, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.The majority of Advanced Airlaid Materials’ sales of hygiene products are to one customer. In addition, sales to the feminine hygiene market accounted for 63% of Advanced Airlaid Materials’ net sales in 2018 and sales are concentrated within a small group of large customers. The loss of the large customer or a decline in sales of hygiene products could have a material adverse effect on this business’s operating results. Our ability to effectively compete could be affected by technological production alternatives which could provide substitute products into this market segment. Customers in the airlaid nonwoven fabric material market, including the hygiene market, may also switch to less expensive products, change preferences or otherwise reduce demand for Advanced Airlaid Materials’ products, thus reducing the size of the markets in which it currently sells its products. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and business prospects.Our operations may be impaired and we may be exposed to potential losses and liability as a result of natural disasters, acts of terrorism or sabotage or similar events.If we have a catastrophic loss or unforeseen operational problem at any of our facilities, we could suffer significant lost production which could impair our ability to satisfy customer demands.Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, typhoons, flooding or fire, and acts of terrorism or sabotage affecting our operating activities and major facilities could materially and adversely affect our operations, operating results and financial condition.In addition, many of our operations require a reliable and abundant supply of water. Such mills rely on a local water body or water source for their water needs and, therefore, are particularly sensitive to drought conditions or other natural or manmade interruptions to water supplies. At various times and for differing periods, we have had to modify operations at certain of our mills due to water shortages, water clarity, or low flow conditions in its principal water supplies. Any interruption or curtailment of operations at any of our production facilities due to drought or low flow conditions at the principal water source or another cause could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.Our pulp mill in Lanao del Norte on the Island of Mindanao in the Republic of the Philippines is located along the Pacific Rim, one of the world’s hazard belts. By virtue of its geographic location, this mill is subject to similar types of natural disasters discussed above, cyclones, typhoons, and volcanic activity. Moreover, the area of Lanao del Norte has been a target of suspected terrorist activities. Our pulp mill in Mindanao is located in a rural portion of the island and is susceptible to attacks and/or power interruptions. The Mindanao mill supplies the abaca pulp used by our Composite Fibers business unit to manufacture paper for single serve coffee and tea products and certain technical specialties products. Any interruption, loss or extended curtailment of operations at our Mindanao mill could affect our ability to meet customer demands for our products and materially affect our operating results and financial condition. GLATFELTER 2018 FORM 10-K7 We have operations in a potentially politically and economically unstable location.Our pulp mill in the Philippines is located in a region that is unstable and subject to political unrest. As discussed above, our Philippine pulp mill produces abaca pulp, a significant raw material used by our Composite Fibers business unit and is currently our main provider of abaca pulp. There are limited suitable alternative sources of readily available abaca pulp in the world. In the event of a disruption in supply from our Philippine mill, there is no guarantee that we could obtain adequate amounts of abaca pulp, if at all, from alternative sources at a reasonable price. Further, there is no assurance the performance of such alternative materials will satisfy customer performance requirements. As a consequence, any civil disturbance, unrest, political instability or other event that causes a disruption in supply could limit the availability of abaca pulp and would increase our cost of obtaining abaca pulp. Such occurrences could adversely impact our sales volumes, revenues and operating results.Our international operations pose certain risks that may adversely impact sales and earnings.We have significant operations and assets located in Canada, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and the Philippines. Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of unique risks, in addition to the risks in our domestic sales and operations, including, but not limited to, economic and trade disruptions resulting from geopolitical developments such as “Brexit,” differing protections of intellectual property, trade barriers, labor unrest, exchange controls, regional economic uncertainty, differing (and possibly more stringent) labor regulation, risk of governmental expropriation, domestic and foreign customs and tariffs, differing regulatory environments, difficulty in managing widespread operations and political instability. These factors may adversely affect our future profits. Also, in some foreign jurisdictions, we may be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remit earnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met. Any such limitations would restrict our flexibility in using funds generated in those jurisdictions.We are subject to cyber-security risks related to unauthorized or malicious access to sensitive customer, vendor, company or employee information as well as to the technology that supports our operations and other business processes.Our business operations rely upon secure systems for mill operations, and data capture, processing, storage and reporting. Although we maintain appropriate data security and controls, our information technology systems, and those of our third-party providers, could become subject to cyberattacks. Systems such as ours are inherently exposed to cyber-security risks and potential attacks. The result of such attacks could result in a breach of data security and controls. Such a breach of our network, systems, applications or data could result in operational disruptions or damage or information misappropriation including, but not limited to, interruption to systems availability, denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with us, denial of access to the applications we use to plan our operations, procure materials, manufacture and ship products and account for orders, theft of intellectual knowhow and trade secrets, and inappropriate disclosure of confidential company, employee, customer or vendor information, could stem from such incidents.Any of these operational disruptions and/or misappropriation of information could adversely affect our results of operations, create negative publicity and could have a material effect on our business.We operate in and are subject to taxation from numerous U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.The multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the U.S and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. Our effective tax rates could be affected by changes in tax laws or their interpretation or changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. For example, the European Commission has opened formal investigations to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in certain European countries comply with European Union rules on state aid. The outcome of the European Commission’s investigations could require changes to existing tax rulings that, in turn, could have an impact on our income taxes and results of operations.8In the event any of the above risk factors impact our business in a material way or in combination during the same period, we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to simultaneously fund our operations, finance capital expenditures, satisfy obligations and make dividend payments on our common stock.In addition to debt service obligations, our business requires expenditures to support growth strategies, research and development initiatives, and for normal upgrades or replacements. We expect to meet all of our near and long-term cash needs from a combination of operating cash flow, cash and cash equivalents, availability under our credit facility or other long-term debt. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from these sources, we could be unable to fund our operations, finance capital expenditures, satisfy our near and long-term cash needs or make dividend payments. "
14,GLT,GLATFELTER,2018-02-26,"ITEM 1ARISK FACTORSOur business and financial performance may be adversely affected by a weak global economic environment or downturns in the target markets that we serve.Adverse global economic conditions could impact our target markets resulting in decreased demand for our products. Our results could be adversely affected if economic conditions weaken. In the event of significant currency weakening in the countries into which our products are sold, demand for or pricing of our products could be adversely impacted. Also, there may be periods during which demand for our products is insufficient to enable us to operate our production facilities in an economical manner. As a result, we may be forced to take machine downtime to curtail production to match demand. The economic environment may also cause customer insolvencies which may result in their inability to satisfy their financial obligations to us. These conditions are beyond our control and may have a significant impact on our sales and results of operations.Approximately $87.7 million of our revenue in 2017 was earned from customers located in Ukraine, Russia and members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (also known as “CIS”). Uncertain geo-political conditions, this region’s economic environment and volatile currencies may cause demand for our products to be volatile and cause abrupt changes in our customers buying patterns.Approximately 29% of our net sales in 2017 were shipped to customers in Europe, the demand for which is dependent on economic conditions in this area, or to the extent such customers do business outside of Europe, in other regions of the world. Uncertain economic conditions in this region may cause weakness in demand for our products as well as volatility in our customers buying patterns.6Our airlaid materials capacity expansion project may not be successful due to unanticipated costs, unforeseen delays in production of commercially saleable products or softness in the demand for airlaid products.We invested approximately $85 million to construct a new airlaid production facility in Fort Smith, Arkansas, to allow us to better meet the growing demands for airlaid materials. The success of this airlaid capacity expansion is dependent on a variety of factors including, among others: i.our ability to complete the project, in all material respects, within budget and on schedule; ii.availability and costs of a qualified workforce; iii.qualification, and acceptance by, customers of products produced; iv.demand for airlaid materials and market growth rates; and v.technological changes and innovations.The construction phase of the project is substantially complete and we have begun product qualification. If we incur significant unforeseen delays or if we are unable to produce commercially acceptable airlaid materials to meet growing demands, our results of operations and/or financial position may be adversely affected.Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.A significant proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated from operations outside of the United States. In addition, we own and operate manufacturing facilities in Canada, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and the Philippines. A significant portion of our business is transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar including the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar and Philippine peso, among others. Our euro denominated revenue exceeds euro expenses by an estimated €145 million. With respect to the British pound, Canadian dollar and Philippine peso, we have greater outflows than inflows of these currencies, although to a lesser degree than the euro. As a result, we are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates and such changes could be significant.In the event that one or more European countries were to replace the euro with another currency, business may be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established.Our ability to maintain our products' price competitiveness is reliant, in part, on the relative strength of the currency in which the product is denominated compared to the currency of the market into which it is sold and the functional currency of our competitors. Changes in the rate of exchange of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar, and other currencies, may adversely impact our results of operations and our ability to offer products in certain markets at acceptable prices. For example, approximately $87.7 million of our revenue in 2017 was earned from shipments to customers located in Ukraine, Russia and members of the CIS. Although these sales are denominated in euros, a significant weakening of the customers’ local currencies may adversely affect our revenue, our customers’ credit risk and our results of operation.The cost of raw materials and energy used to manufacture our products could increase and the availability of certain raw materials could become constrained.We require access to sufficient and reasonably priced quantities of pulpwood, pulps, pulp substitutes, abaca fiber, synthetic fibers, colorformers and certain other raw materials, as well as access to reliable and abundant supplies of water to support many of our production facilities.Our Specialty Papers’ locations are vertically integrated manufacturing facilities that can generate approximately 90% of their annual pulp requirements.Our Philippine mill purchases abaca fiber to produce abaca pulp, a key material used to manufacture paper for single-serve coffee, tea and technical specialty products at Composite Fibers’ facilities. At certain times, the supply of abaca fiber has been constrained or the quality diminished due to factors such as weather-related damage to the source crop as well as decisions by land owners to produce alternative crops in lieu of those used to produce abaca fiber. These factors have contributed to volatility in fiber prices or limited available supply.Our Advanced Airlaid Materials business unit requires access to sufficient quantities of fluff pulp, the supply of which is subject to availability of certain softwoods. Softwood availability can be limited by many factors, including weather in regions where softwoods are abundant.The cost of many of our production materials, including petroleum based chemicals and freight charges, are influenced by the cost of oil. In addition, we recently completed the conversion of Specialty Papers’ boilers to burn natural gas as opposed to coal. Natural gas is now the principal source of fuel for each of our facilities worldwide and has historically been more volatile than other fuels. GLATFELTER 2017 FORM 10-K7 Government rules, regulations and policies have an impact on the cost of certain energy sources, particularly for our European operations. In Europe, we currently benefit from a number of government sponsored programs related to, among others, green energy or renewable energy initiatives designed to mitigate the cost of electricity to larger industrial consumers of power. Any reduction in the extent of government sponsored incentives may adversely affect the cost ultimately borne by our operations. Furthermore, the European Commission is investigating certain energy programs in Germany from which we benefit as to whether the programs comply with European Union rules on state aid. The outcome of these investigations could require us to return certain benefits previously earned or reduce such benefits in the future and could impact our results of operations.Although we have contractual arrangements with certain Advanced Airlaid Materials’ customers pursuant to which our product’s selling price is adjusted for changes in the cost of certain raw materials, we may not be able to fully pass increased raw materials or energy costs on to all customers if the market will not bear the higher price or if existing agreements limit price increases. If price adjustments significantly trail increases in raw materials or energy prices, our operating results could be adversely affected.Our industry is highly competitive and increased competition could reduce our sales and profitability.Specialty Papers  The primary geographic market for our Specialty Papers business unit is the United States, which has been adversely affected by declining demand for uncoated free sheet, industry capacity exceeding demand, and increased imports from foreign competitors. As a result, the industry has historically taken steps to reduce capacity, although the timing of the reductions is uncertain. Slowing demand or increased competition could force us to lower our prices or to offer additional services at a higher cost to us, which could reduce our gross margins and net income. The greater financial resources of certain of our competitors may enable them to commit larger amounts of capital in response to changing market conditions. Certain competitors may also have the ability to develop product or service innovations that could put us at a competitive disadvantage.There have been periods of supply/demand imbalance in our industry which have caused pulp prices and our products’ selling prices to be volatile. The timing and magnitude of price increases or decreases in these markets have generally varied by region and by product type. A sustained period of weak demand or excess supply would likely adversely affect pulp prices and our products’ selling prices. Continued imbalance could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results.Some of the other factors that may adversely affect our ability to compete in Specialty Papers’ markets include: •the entry of new competitors into the markets we serve; •the prevalence of imported product, particularly uncoated free sheet, into the U.S.; •the willingness of commodity-based and coated producers to enter our markets when they are unable to compete or when demand softens in their traditional markets; •the aggressiveness of our competitors’ pricing strategies, which could force us to decrease prices in order to maintain market share; •our failure to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences; •the impact of electronic-based substitutes for certain of our products such as carbonless and forms, book publishing, and envelope papers; •the impact of replacement or disruptive technologies; •changes in end-user preferences; •our inability to develop new, improved or enhanced products; •our inability to maintain the cost efficiency of our facilities; and •the cost of regulatory environmental compliance requirements.Composite Fibers and Advanced Airlaid Materials  The global markets in which we compete, although growing, are not as large as the markets for Specialty Papers. As a result, our ability to compete is more sensitive to, and may be adversely impacted by, the following: •the entry of new competitors into the markets we serve; •the aggressiveness of our competitors’ pricing strategies, which could force us to decrease prices in order to maintain market share; •our failure to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences; and •technological advances or changes that impact production or cost competiveness of our products.The impact of any significant changes may result in our inability to effectively compete in the markets in which we operate, and as a result our sales and operating results would be adversely affected.8We may not be able to develop new products acceptable to our existing or potential customers.Our business strategy is market focused and includes investments in developing new products to meet the changing needs of our customers, serve new customers and to maintain our market share. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop and introduce new and enhanced products that keep pace with introductions by our competitors and changing customer preferences. If we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to these factors, we may lose opportunities for business with both current and potential customers. The success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors, including our ability to: •anticipate and properly identify our customers' needs and industry trends; •develop and commercialize new products and applications in a timely manner; •price our products competitively; •differentiate our products from our competitors' products; and •invest efficiently in research and development activities.Our inability to develop new products or new business opportunities could adversely impact our business and ultimately harm our profitability.We are subject to substantial costs and potential liability for environmental matters.We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations, including discharges into the environment, and the handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. We are also subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and clean-up responsibility for releases of hazardous substances. To comply with environmental laws and regulations, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial capital and operating expenditures. The Clean Air Act, and similar regulations, has imposed significant compliance costs and required significant capital expenditures. Compliance with the Clean Air Act resulted in significant process modifications to the boilers at two of our facilities in 2017 and 2016.We anticipate that environmental regulation of our operations will continue to become more burdensome and that capital and operating expenditures necessary to comply with environmental regulations will continue, and perhaps increase, in the future. Because environmental regulations are not consistent worldwide, our ability to compete globally may be adversely affected by capital and operating expenditures required for environmental compliance. In addition, we may incur obligations to remove or mitigate any adverse effects on the environment, such as air and water quality, resulting from mills we operate or have operated. Potential obligations include compensation for the restoration of natural resources, personal injury and property damages. See Item 1 – Environmental Matters for an additional discussion of expected costs to comply with environmental regulations.We have exposure to potential liability for remediation and other costs related to the presence of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the lower Fox River on which our former Neenah, Wisconsin mill was located. As more fully discussed in Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 20, in 2016 and 2015, we increased our reserve for potential liabilities by $40 million and $10 million, respectively. The increase recorded in 2016 was primarily based on our evaluation of a consent decree between two other defendants and the government agencies. We have financial reserves for this matter but we cannot be certain that those reserves will be adequate to provide for future obligations related to this matter, that our share of costs and/or damages will not exceed our available resources, or that such obligations will not have a long-term, material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations.Our environmental issues are complex and should be reviewed in the context set forth in more detail in Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 20.The Advanced Airlaid Materials business unit generates a substantial portion of its revenue from one customer serving the hygiene products market, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.The majority of Advanced Airlaid Materials’ sales of hygiene products are to one customer. In addition, sales to the feminine hygiene market accounted for 70% of Advanced Airlaid Materials’ net sales in 2017 and sales are concentrated within a small group of large customers. The loss of the large customer or a decline in sales of hygiene products could have a material adverse effect on this business’s operating results. Our ability to effectively compete could be affected by technological production alternatives which could provide substitute products into this market segment. Customers in the airlaid nonwoven fabric material market, including the hygiene market, may also switch to less expensive products, change preferences or otherwise reduce demand for Advanced Airlaid Material’s products, thus reducing the size of the markets in which it currently sells its products. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and business prospects. GLATFELTER 2017 FORM 10-K9 Our operations may be impaired and we may be exposed to potential losses and liability as a result of natural disasters, acts of terrorism or sabotage or similar events.If we have a catastrophic loss or unforeseen operational problem at any of our facilities, we could suffer significant lost production which could impair our ability to satisfy customer demands.Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, typhoons, flooding or fire, and acts of terrorism or sabotage affecting our operating activities and major facilities could materially and adversely affect our operations, operating results and financial condition.In addition, we own and maintain two dams in York County, Pennsylvania, that were built to ensure a steady supply of water for the operation of our facility in Spring Grove which is a primary manufacturing location for our envelope papers and engineered products. Each of these dams is classified as “high hazard” by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania because they are located in close proximity to inhabited areas. Any sudden failure of a dam, including as a result of natural disaster or act of terrorism or sabotage, would endanger occupants and residential, commercial and industrial structures, for which we could be liable. The failure of a dam could also be extremely disruptive and result in damage to, or the shut down of, our Spring Grove mill. Any losses or liabilities incurred due to the failure of one of our dams may not be fully covered by or may substantially exceed the limits of our insurance policies and could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.In addition, many of our papermaking operations require a reliable and abundant supply of water. Such mills rely on a local water body or water source for their water needs and, therefore, are particularly sensitive to drought conditions or other natural or manmade interruptions to water supplies. At various times and for differing periods, each of our mills has had to modify operations due to water shortages, water clarity, or low flow conditions in its principal water supplies. Any interruption or curtailment of operations at any of our production facilities due to drought or low flow conditions at the principal water source or another cause could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.Our pulp mill in Lanao del Norte on the Island of Mindanao in the Republic of the Philippines is located along the Pacific Rim, one of the world’s hazard belts. By virtue of its geographic location, this mill is subject to similar types of natural disasters discussed above, cyclones, typhoons, and volcanic activity. Moreover, the area of Lanao del Norte has been a target of suspected terrorist activities. Our pulp mill in Mindanao is located in a rural portion of the island and is susceptible to attacks and/or power interruptions. The Mindanao mill supplies the abaca pulp used by our Composite Fibers business unit to manufacture paper for single serve coffee and tea products and certain technical specialties products. Any interruption, loss or extended curtailment of operations at our Mindanao mill could affect our ability to meet customer demands for our products and materially affect our operating results and financial condition.We have operations in a potentially politically and economically unstable location.Our pulp mill in the Philippines is located in a region that is unstable and subject to political unrest. As discussed above, our Philippine pulp mill produces abaca pulp, a significant raw material used by our Composite Fibers business unit, and is currently our main provider of abaca pulp. There are limited suitable alternative sources of readily available abaca pulp in the world. In the event of a disruption in supply from our Philippine mill, there is no guarantee that we could obtain adequate amounts of abaca pulp, if at all, from alternative sources at a reasonable price. Further, there is no assurance the performance of such alternative materials will satisfy customer performance requirements. As a consequence, any civil disturbance, unrest, political instability or other event that causes a disruption in supply could limit the availability of abaca pulp and would increase our cost of obtaining abaca pulp. Such occurrences could adversely impact our sales volumes, revenues and operating results.Our international operations pose certain risks that may adversely impact sales and earnings.We have significant operations and assets located in Canada, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and the Philippines. Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of unique risks, in addition to the risks in our domestic sales and operations, including differing protections of intellectual property, trade barriers, labor unrest, exchange controls, regional economic uncertainty, differing (and possibly more stringent) labor regulation, risk of governmental expropriation, domestic and foreign customs and tariffs, differing regulatory environments, difficulty in managing widespread operations and political instability. These factors may adversely affect our future profits. Also, in some foreign jurisdictions, we may be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remit earnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met. Any such limitations would restrict our flexibility in using funds generated in those jurisdictions.10We are subject to cyber-security risks related to unauthorized or malicious access to sensitive customer, vendor, company or employee information as well as to the technology that supports our operations and other business processes.Our business operations rely upon secure systems for mill operations, and data capture, processing, storage and reporting. Although we maintain appropriate data security and controls, our information technology systems, and those of our third party providers, could become subject to cyber attacks. Systems such as ours are inherently exposed to cyber-security risks and potential attacks. The result of such attacks could result in a breach of data security and controls. Such a breach of our network, systems, applications or data could result in operational disruptions or damage or information misappropriation including, but not limited to, interruption to systems availability, denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with us, denial of access to the applications we use to plan our operations, procure materials, manufacture and ship products and account for orders, theft of intellectual knowhow and trade secrets, and inappropriate disclosure of confidential company, employee, customer or vendor information, could stem from such incidents.Any of these operational disruptions and/or misappropriation of information could adversely affect our results of operations, create negative publicity and could have a material effect on our business.We operate in and are subject to taxation from numerous U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.The multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the U.S and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. Our effective tax rates could be affected by changes in tax laws or their interpretation or changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. For example, the European Commission has opened formal investigations to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in certain European countries comply with European Union rules on state aid. The outcome of the European Commission’s investigations could require changes to existing tax rulings that, in turn, could have an impact on our income taxes and results of operations.In the event any of the above risk factors impact our business in a material way or in combination during the same period, we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to simultaneously fund our operations, finance capital expenditures, satisfy obligations and make dividend payments on our common stock.In addition to debt service obligations, our business is capital intensive and requires significant expenditures to support growth strategies, research and development initiatives, environmental compliance, and for normal upgrades or replacements. We expect to meet all of our near and long-term cash needs from a combination of operating cash flow, cash and cash equivalents, availability under our existing credit facility or other long-term debt. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from these sources, we could be unable to fund our operations, finance capital expenditures, satisfy our near and long-term cash needs or make dividend payments. GLATFELTER 2017 FORM 10-K11 "

These conditions are beyond our control and may have a significant impact on our sales and results of operations.Approximately $73.8 million of our revenue in 2016 was earned from customers located in Ukraine, Russia and members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (also known as “CIS”). Uncertain geo-political conditions, this region’s economic environment and weak currencies have caused and may continue to cause weak demand for our products and volatility in our customers buying patterns.Approximately 28% of our net sales in 2016 were shipped to customers in Europe, the demand for which is dependent on economic conditions in this area, or to the extent such customers do business outside of Europe, in other regions of the world. Uncertain economic conditions in this region may cause weakness in demand for our products as well as volatility in our customers buying patterns.Our airlaid materials capacity expansion project may not be successful due to unanticipated costs, unforeseen delays in production of commercially saleable products or softness in the demand for airlaid products.We are investing approximately $80 million to construct a new airlaid production facility in Fort Smith, Arkansas, to allow us to better meet the growing demands for airlaid materials. The success of our $80 million investment to expand capacity for airlaid materials is dependent on a variety of factors including, among others: i.our ability to complete the project, in all material respects, within budget and on schedule; ii.availability and costs of a qualified workforce; iii.qualification, and acceptance by, customers of products produced; iv.demand for airlaid materials and market growth rates; and v.technological changes and innovations.If we incur significant unforeseen costs or delays or if we are unable to produce commercially acceptable airlaid materials to meet growing demands, our results of operations and/or financial position may be adversely affected.Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.A significant proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated from operations outside of the United States. In addition, we own and operate manufacturing facilities in Canada, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and the Philippines. A significant portion of our business is transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar including 6the euro, British pound, Canadian dollars and Philippine peso, among others. Our euro denominated revenue exceeds euro expenses by an estimated €130 million. With respect to the British pound, Canadian dollar and Philippine peso, we have greater outflows than inflows of these currencies, although to a lesser degree than the euro. As a result, we are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates and such changes could be significant.Economic weakness, the potential inability of certain European countries to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations, actions of this region’s central banks and disunity within the European Union memberships has caused, and could continue to cause, the value of the euro to weaken. As a result, our operating results could be negatively impacted. In the event that one or more European countries were to replace the euro with another currency, business may be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established.Our ability to maintain our products' price competitiveness is reliant, in part, on the relative strength of the currency in which the product is denominated compared to the currency of the market into which it is sold and the functional currency of our competitors. Changes in the rate of exchange of foreign currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar, and other currencies, may adversely impact our results of operations and our ability to offer products in certain markets at acceptable prices. For example, approximately $73.8 million of our revenue in 2016 was earned from shipments to customers located in Ukraine, Russia and members of the CIS. Although these sales are denominated in euros, a significant weakening of the customers’ local currencies has and may continue to adversely affect our revenue, our customers’ credit risk and our results of operation.The cost of raw materials and energy used to manufacture our products could increase and the availability of certain raw materials could become constrained.We require access to sufficient and reasonably priced quantities of pulpwood, purchased pulps, pulp substitutes, abaca fiber, synthetic fibers, and certain other raw materials, as well as access to reliable and abundant supply of water to support many of our production facilities.Our Specialty Papers’ locations are vertically integrated manufacturing facilities that can generate approximately 85% of their annual pulp requirements.Our Philippine mill purchases abaca fiber to produce abaca pulp, a key material used to manufacture paper for single-serve coffee, tea and technical specialty products at Composite Fibers’ facilities. At certain times, the supply of abaca fiber has been constrained or the quality diminished due to factors such as weather-related damage to the source crop as well as decisions by land owners to produce alternative crops in lieu of those used to produce abaca fiber. These factors have contributed to volatility in fiber prices or limited available supply.Our Advanced Airlaid Materials business unit requires access to sufficient quantities of fluff pulp, the supply of which is subject to availability of certain softwoods. Softwood availability can be limited by many factors, including weather in regions where softwoods are abundant.The cost of many of our production materials, including petroleum based chemicals and freight charges, are influenced by the cost of oil. In addition, we recently completed the conversion of Specialty Papers’ boilers to burn natural gas as opposed to coal. Natural gas is now the principal source of fuel for each of our facilities worldwide.Government rules, regulations and policies have an impact on the cost of certain energy sources, particularly for our European operations. In Europe, we currently benefit from a number of government sponsored programs related to, among others, green energy or renewable energy initiatives designed to mitigate the cost of electricity to larger industrial consumers of power. Any reduction in the extent of government sponsored incentives may adversely affect the cost ultimately borne by our operations. Furthermore, the European Commission is investigating certain energy programs in Germany from which we benefit as to whether the programs comply with European Union rules on state aid. The outcome of these investigations could require us to return certain benefits previously earned or reduce such benefits in the future and could impact our results of operations.Although we have contractual cost pass-through arrangements with certain Advanced Airlaid Materials’ customers, we may not be able to fully pass increased raw materials or energy costs on to all customers if the market will not bear the higher price or if existing agreements limit price increases. If price adjustments significantly trail increases in raw materials or energy prices, our operating results could be adversely affected.Our industry is highly competitive and increased competition could reduce our sales and profitability.Specialty Papers  The primary geographic market for our Specialty Papers business unit is the United States, which has been adversely affected by declining demand for uncoated free sheet, industry capacity exceeding demand, and increased imports from foreign competitors. As a result, the industry has historically taken steps to reduce capacity, although the timing of the reductions is uncertain. Slowing demand or increased competition could force us to lower our prices or to offer additional services at a higher cost to us, which could reduce our gross margins and net income. The greater financial  GLATFELTER 2016 FORM 10-K7 resources of certain of our competitors may enable them to commit larger amounts of capital in response to changing market conditions. Certain competitors may also have the ability to develop product or service innovations that could put us at a competitive disadvantage.There have been periods of supply/demand imbalance in our industry which have caused pulp prices and our products’ selling prices to be volatile. The timing and magnitude of price increases or decreases in these markets have generally varied by region and by product type. A sustained period of weak demand or excess supply would likely adversely affect pulp prices and our products’ selling prices. This could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results.Some of the other factors that may adversely affect our ability to compete in Specialty Papers’ markets include: •the entry of new competitors into the markets we serve; •the prevalence of imported product, particularly uncoated free sheet, into the U.S.; •the willingness of commodity-based producers to enter our markets when they are unable to compete or when demand softens in their traditional markets; •the aggressiveness of our competitors’ pricing strategies, which could force us to decrease prices in order to maintain market share; •our failure to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences; •the impact of electronic-based substitutes for certain of our products such as carbonless and forms, book publishing, and envelope papers; •the impact of replacement or disruptive technologies; •changes in end-user preferences; •our inability to develop new, improved or enhanced products; •our inability to maintain the cost efficiency of our facilities; and •the cost of regulatory environmental compliance requirements.Composite Fibers and Advanced Airlaid Materials  The global markets in which we compete, although growing, are not as large as the markets for Specialty Papers. As a result, our ability to compete is more sensitive to, and may be adversely impacted by, the following: •the entry of new competitors into the markets we serve; •the aggressiveness of our competitors’ pricing strategies, which could force us to decrease prices in order to maintain market share; •our failure to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences; and •technological advances or changes that impact production or cost competiveness of our products.The impact of any significant changes may result in our inability to effectively compete in the markets in which we operate, and as a result our sales and operating results would be adversely affected.We may not be able to develop new products acceptable to our existing or potential customers.Our business strategy is market focused and includes investments in developing new products to meet the changing needs of our customers, serve new customers and to maintain our market share. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop and introduce new and enhanced products that keep pace with introductions by our competitors and changing customer preferences. If we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to these factors, we may lose opportunities for business with both current and potential customers. The success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors, including our ability to: •anticipate and properly identify our customers' needs and industry trends; •develop and commercialize new products and applications in a timely manner; •price our products competitively; •differentiate our products from our competitors' products; and •invest efficiently in research and development activities.Our inability to develop new products or new business opportunities could adversely impact our business and ultimately harm our profitability.We are subject to substantial costs and potential liability for environmental matters.We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations, including discharges into the environment, and the handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. We are also subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and clean-up responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. To comply with environmental laws and regulations, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial capital and operating expenditures. The Clean Air Act, and similar regulations, has imposed significant compliance costs and 8required significant capital expenditures. Compliance with the Clean Air Act resulted in significant process modifications to the boilers at two of our facilities.We anticipate that environmental regulation of our operations will continue to become more burdensome and that capital and operating expenditures necessary to comply with environmental regulations will continue, and perhaps increase, in the future. Because environmental regulations are not consistent worldwide, our ability to compete globally may be adversely affected by capital and operating expenditures required for environmental compliance. In addition, we may incur obligations to remove or mitigate any adverse effects on the environment, such as air and water quality, resulting from mills we operate or have operated. Potential obligations include compensation for the restoration of natural resources, personal injury and property damages. See Item 1 – Environmental Matters for an additional discussion of expected costs to comply with environmental regulations.We have exposure to potential liability for remediation and other costs related to the presence of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the lower Fox River on which our former Neenah, Wisconsin mill was located. As more fully discussed in Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 21, in 2016 and 2015, we increased our reserve for potential liabilities by $40.0 million and $10 million, respectively. The increase recorded in 2016 was based on our current evaluation of recent developments, particularly a proposed consent decree between two other defendants and the government agencies. We have financial reserves for this matter but we cannot be certain that those reserves will be adequate to provide for future obligations related to this matter, that our share of costs and/or damages will not exceed our available resources, or that such obligations will not have a long-term, material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations.Our environmental issues are complex and should be reviewed in the context set forth in more detail in Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 21.The Advanced Airlaid Materials business unit generates a substantial portion of its revenue from one customer serving the hygiene products market, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.The majority of Advanced Airlaid Materials’ sales of hygiene products are to one customer. In addition, sales to the feminine hygiene market accounted for 71% of Advanced Airlaid Materials’ net sales in 2016 and sales are concentrated within a small group of large customers. The loss of the large customer or a decline in sales of hygiene products could have a material adverse effect on this business’s operating results. Our ability to effectively compete could be affected by technological production alternatives which could provide substitute products into this market segment. Customers in the airlaid nonwoven fabric material market, including the hygiene market, may also switch to less expensive products, change preferences or otherwise reduce demand for Advanced Airlaid Material’s products, thus reducing the size of the markets in which it currently sells its products. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and business prospects.Our operations may be impaired and we may be exposed to potential losses and liability as a result of natural disasters, acts of terrorism or sabotage or similar events.If we have a catastrophic loss or unforeseen operational problem at any of our facilities, we could suffer significant lost production which could impair our ability to satisfy customer demands.Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, typhoons, flooding or fire, and acts of terrorism or sabotage affecting our operating activities and major facilities could materially and adversely affect our operations, operating results and financial condition.In addition, we own and maintain two dams in York County, Pennsylvania, that were built to ensure a steady supply of water for the operation of our facility in Spring Grove which is a primary manufacturing location for our envelope papers and engineered products. Each of these dams is classified as “high hazard” by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania because they are located in close proximity to inhabited areas. Any sudden failure of a dam, including as a result of natural disaster or act of terrorism or sabotage, would endanger occupants and residential, commercial and industrial structures, for which we could be liable. The failure of a dam could also be extremely disruptive and result in damage to, or the shutdown of, our Spring Grove mill. Any losses or liabilities incurred due to the failure of one of our dams may not be fully covered by or may substantially exceed the limits of our insurance policies and could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.In addition, many of our papermaking operations require a reliable and abundant supply of water. Such mills rely on a local water body or water source for their water needs and, therefore, are particularly sensitive to drought conditions or other natural or manmade interruptions to water supplies. At various times and for differing periods, each of our mills has had to modify operations due to water shortages, water clarity, or low flow conditions in its principal water supplies. Any interruption or curtailment of operations at any of our production facilities due to drought or low flow conditions at the principal water source or another cause could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. GLATFELTER 2016 FORM 10-K9 Our pulp mill in Lanao del Norte on the Island of Mindanao in the Republic of the Philippines is located along the Pacific Rim, one of the world’s hazard belts. By virtue of its geographic location, this mill is subject to similar types of natural disasters discussed above, cyclones, typhoons, and volcanic activity. Moreover, the area of Lanao del Norte has been a target of suspected terrorist activities. Our pulp mill in Mindanao is located in a rural portion of the island and is susceptible to attacks and/or power interruptions. The Mindanao mill supplies the abaca pulp used by our Composite Fibers business unit to manufacture paper for single serve coffee and tea products and certain technical specialties products. Any interruption, loss or extended curtailment of operations at our Mindanao mill could affect our ability to meet customer demands for our products and materially affect our operating results and financial condition.We have operations in a potentially politically and economically unstable location.Our pulp mill in the Philippines is located in a region that is unstable and subject to political unrest. As discussed above, our Philippine pulp mill produces abaca pulp, a significant raw material used by our Composite Fibers business unit, and is currently our main provider of abaca pulp. There are limited suitable alternative sources of readily available abaca pulp in the world. In the event of a disruption in supply from our Philippine mill, there is no guarantee that we could obtain adequate amounts of abaca pulp, if at all, from alternative sources at a reasonable price. Further, there is no assurance the performance of such alternative materials will satisfy customer performance requirements. As a consequence, any civil disturbance, unrest, political instability or other event that causes a disruption in supply could limit the availability of abaca pulp and would increase our cost of obtaining abaca pulp. Such occurrences could adversely impact our sales volumes, revenues and operating results.Our international operations pose certain risks that may adversely impact sales and earnings.We have significant operations and assets located in Canada, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and the Philippines. Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of unique risks, in addition to the risks in our domestic sales and operations, including differing protections of intellectual property, trade barriers, labor unrest, exchange controls, regional economic uncertainty, differing (and possibly more stringent) labor regulation, risk of governmental expropriation, domestic and foreign customs and tariffs, differing regulatory environments, difficulty in managing widespread operations and political instability. These factors may adversely affect our future profits. Also, in some foreign jurisdictions, we may be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remit earnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met. Any such limitations would restrict our flexibility in using funds generated in those jurisdictions.We are subject to cyber-security risks related to unauthorized or malicious access to sensitive customer, vendor, company or employee information as well as to the technology that supports our operations and other business processes.Our business operations rely upon secure systems for mill operations, and data capture, processing, storage and reporting. Although we maintain appropriate data security and controls, our information technology systems, and those of our third party providers, could become subject to cyber attacks. Systems such as ours are inherently exposed to cyber-security risks and potential attacks. The result of such attacks could result in a breach of data security and controls. Such a breach of our network, systems, applications or data could result in operational disruptions or damage or information misappropriation including, but not limited to, interruption to systems availability, denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with us, denial of access to the applications we use to plan our operations, procure materials, manufacture and ship products and account for orders, theft of intellectual knowhow and trade secrets, and inappropriate disclosure of confidential company, employee, customer or vendor information, could stem from such incidents.Any of these operational disruptions and/or misappropriation of information could adversely affect our results of operations, create negative publicity and could have a material effect on our business.We operate in and are subject to taxation from numerous U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.The multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the U.S and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. Our effective tax rates could be affected by changes in tax laws or their interpretation or changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. For example, the European Commission has opened formal investigations to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in certain European countries comply with European Union rules on state aid. The outcome of the European Commission’s investigations could require changes to existing tax rulings that, in turn, could have an impact on our income taxes and results of operations.10In the event any of the above risk factors impact our business in a material way or in combination during the same period, we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to simultaneously fund our operations, finance capital expenditures, satisfy obligations and make dividend payments on our common stock.In addition to debt service obligations, our business is capital intensive and requires significant expenditures to support growth strategies, research and development initiatives, environmental compliance, and for normal upgrades or replacements. We expect to meet all of our near and long-term cash needs from a combination of operating cash flow, cash and cash equivalents, availability under our existing credit facility or other long-term debt. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from these sources, we could be unable to fund our operations, finance capital expenditures, satisfy our near and long-term cash needs or make dividend payments"
