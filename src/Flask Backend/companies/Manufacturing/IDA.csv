16,IDA,IDACORP INC,2024-02-15,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS IDACORP and Idaho Power operate in a highly regulated industry and business environment that involves significant risks, many of which are beyond the companies' control. The circumstances and factors set forth below should not be considered a complete list of potential risks that the companies may encounter. These risk factors, as well as additional risks and uncertainties either not known as of the date of this report or that are currently believed to not be material to the business, may have a material impact on the business, financial condition, or results of operations of IDACORP and Idaho Power and could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in any forward-looking statements. These risk factors, as well as other information in this report, including without limitation, in the ""Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"" and Part II - Item 7 - MD&A, and in other reports the companies file with the SEC, should be considered carefully when making any investment decisions relating to IDACORP or Idaho Power. Below are certain important utility-specific regulatory, operational, legal and compliance, financial and investment, and general business risks that may cause IDACORP's and Idaho Power's future business results to be different than anticipated as of the date of this report. Utility-Specific Regulatory RisksUtility-specific regulatory risk includes the risks that federal, state, or local regulators may impose additional requirements and costs on Idaho Power and the utility industry, reduce authorized rates of return or otherwise adversely affect recovery of costs and the opportunity to earn a return on investments, or require Idaho Power as a utility to make adverse changes to its business models, strategies, and practices. State or federal regulators may not approve customer rates that provide timely or sufficient recovery of Idaho Power's costs or allow Idaho Power to earn a reasonable rate of return, which could adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. The prices that the IPUC and OPUC authorize Idaho Power to charge customers for its retail services, and the tariff rate that the FERC permits Idaho Power to charge for its transmission services, are significant factors influencing IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s business, results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition. Idaho Power's ability to recover its costs and earn a reasonable rate of return can be affected by many regulatory factors, including the time between when Idaho Power incurs costs and when Idaho Power recovers those costs in customers’ rates (often called ""regulatory lag"" in the utility industry), and differences between the costs included in rates and the amount of actual costs incurred. Idaho Power expects to incur increasing costs, which is likely to occur before the IPUC, OPUC, or FERC approve the recovery of those costs, such as construction costs for new facilities and transmission resources, costs associated with changes in the long-term cost-effectiveness or operating conditions of Idaho Power's assets that could result in early retirements of utility facilities, costs of compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements, fuel and wholesale power costs, and increased funding levels of Idaho Power's defined benefit pension plan. The IPUC, OPUC, and FERC may not allow Idaho Power to recover some or all of those costs or costs that have already been deferred as regulatory assets if they find Idaho Power did not reasonably or prudently incur those costs or for other reasons. The IPUC and OPUC may adopt different methods 21Table of Contents                                                            of calculating the allocation of the total utility costs in their respective jurisdictions, resulting in certain costs excluded in both states. Ratemaking has generally been premised on estimates of historic costs based on a test year, so if a given year’s actual costs are higher than historic costs, rates may not be sufficient to cover actual costs. While rate regulation is also premised on the assumption that rates established are fair, just, and reasonable, regulators have considerable discretion in applying this standard. Economic, political, legislative, public policy, or regulatory pressures may lead stakeholders to seek rate reductions or refunds, limits on rate increases, or lower allowed rates of return on investments for Idaho Power. The ratemaking process typically involves multiple intervening parties, including governmental bodies, consumer advocacy groups, and customers, generally with the common objective of limiting rate increases or even reducing rates. While Idaho Power reached a settlement stipulation for its 2023 general rate case in Idaho that was approved by the IPUC, with the large amount of ongoing investments and the associated regulatory lag in cost recovery, Idaho Power has filed a general rate case in Oregon and on February 14, 2024, Idaho Power provided notice to the IPUC of its intent to file a general rate case or limited issue rate proceeding in Idaho on or after June 1, 2024. There can be no assurance that any rate case filed by Idaho Power will result in an outcome that is satisfactory for Idaho Power. In the past, Idaho Power has been denied recovery, or required to defer recovery pending the next general rate case, including denials or deferrals related to capital expenditures for long-term project expenses. Adverse outcomes in regulatory proceedings, or significant regulatory lag, may cause Idaho Power to incur unrecovered project costs or result in cancellation of projects, or to record an impairment of its assets or otherwise adversely affect cash flows and earnings. This may also result in lower credit ratings, reduced access to capital, higher financing costs, and reductions or delays in planned capital expenditures.For additional information relating to Idaho Power's state and federal regulatory framework and regulatory matters, see Part I - Item 1 - ""Business - Utility Operations,"" Part II - Item 7 - MD&A - ""Regulatory Matters,"" and Note 3 - ""Regulatory Matters"" to the consolidated financial statements of Part II - Item 8 in this report. Idaho Power's regulatory cost recovery mechanisms may not function as intended and are subject to change or elimination, which may adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power has power cost adjustment mechanisms in its Idaho and Oregon jurisdictions and a FCA mechanism in Idaho. The power cost adjustment mechanisms track Idaho Power’s actual net power supply costs (primarily fuel and purchased power less wholesale energy sales) and compare these amounts to net power supply costs being recovered in retail rates. A majority of the differences between these two amounts is deferred for future recovery from, or refund to, customers through rates. Volatility in power supply costs continues to be significant, in large part due to fluctuations in hydropower generation conditions, fuel cost variability from factors including supply chain disruptions and inflation, supply and demand economics for fuel and power, the impact of high costs to purchase renewable energy under mandatory long-term contracts, and market price variability for power purchases from third parties based on seasonal demands and transmission system constraints. Changes in market dynamics due to the emergence of day ahead or other energy and transmission markets in the West could also increase the volatility of power supply costs. While the power cost adjustment mechanisms function to mitigate the potentially adverse impact on net income of power supply cost volatility, the mechanisms do not eliminate the cash flow impact of that volatility. When power costs rise above the level recovered in current retail rates, Idaho Power incurs the costs but recovery of those costs is deferred to a subsequent collection period, which can adversely affect operating cash flow and liquidity until those costs are recovered. The FCA mechanism is a decoupling mechanism that allows Idaho Power to charge Idaho residential and small commercial customers when it recovers less than the base level of fixed costs per customer that the IPUC authorized for recovery. The power cost adjustment and FCA mechanisms are generally subject to change at the discretion of applicable state regulators, who could decide to modify or eliminate either mechanism in a manner that adversely impacts IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.  Operational RisksOperational risk relates to risks arising from the systems, assets, processes, people, and external factors that affect the operation of IDACORP's or Idaho Power's businesses.Changes in customer growth and customer usage may negatively affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's business, financial condition, and results of operations. Changes in the number of customers and customers' use of electricity are affected by a number of factors, such as population growth or decline in Idaho Power's service area, expansion or loss of service area, changes in customer needs and expectations, changes to customer rates, adoption rates of energy efficiency measures, customer-generated power such as from solar panels and gas-fired generators, demand-side management requirements, regulation or deregulation, and adverse economic conditions. Continued inflationary pressures, or an economic downturn or recession, could also negatively impact customer use and reduce revenues and cash flows, thus adversely affecting results of operations. Many electric utilities, including Idaho Power, have experienced a long-term decline in usage per customer, in part attributable to 22Table of Contents                                                            energy efficiency activities. State or federal regulations may be enacted to encourage or require mandatory energy conservation or technological advances that increase energy efficiency, which could further reduce usage per customer. Also, changing customer needs and expectations, increased customer rates as a result of the 2023 Idaho general rate case and any future rate cases, and increased competition from customer-owned generation could lead to lower customer satisfaction, reduced loyalty, difficulty in obtaining rate increases, legislation to deregulate electric service, and customers seeking alternative sources of energy and electric service. If customers choose to generate their own energy, discontinue a portion or all service from Idaho Power, or replace electric power for heating with natural gas, demand for Idaho Power's energy may decline and adversely impact the affordability of its services for remaining customers. While Idaho Power has recently experienced a net growth in usage due to an increase in the number of customers, when adjusted for the impacts of weather, the average monthly usage on a per customer basis for Idaho Power's residential customers has declined from 1,032 kWh in 2012 to 922 kWh in 2023. There is also no guarantee that Idaho Power will continue to experience an increase in the number of customers at the current rate of growth or at all. Rate mechanisms, such as the Idaho FCA for residential and small commercial customers, are designed to address the financial disincentive associated with promoting energy efficiency activities, but there is no assurance that the mechanism will result in full or timely collection of Idaho Power's fixed costs, which are currently collected in large part through the company's volume-based energy rates that are based on historical sales volume. Any undercollection of fixed costs would adversely impact revenues, earnings, and cash flows. The formation of municipal utilities or similar entities for distribution systems within Idaho Power's service area could also result in a load decrease. The loss of loads resulting from some of these events may result in excess infrastructure and stranded costs and require IDACORP and Idaho Power to modify or eliminate large generation, storage, or transmission projects. This could in turn result in reduced revenues as well as write-downs or write-offs if regulators determine that the costs of the projects were incurred imprudently, which could have a material adverse impact on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Conversely, if Idaho Power were to experience an unanticipated increase in the demand for energy through, for example, the rapid addition of new industrial and commercial customers or population growth in the service area, Idaho Power may be required to rely on higher-cost purchased power to meet peak system demand and may need to accelerate investment in additional generation or transmission resources. Idaho Power's 2023 IRP preferred resource portfolio and action plan included a need to acquire significant generation and storage resources to meet forecasted increasing energy and capacity needs. There can be no assurance that these energy and capacity needs will not change or that the resources will be adequate to meet load demands, in which case Idaho Power would need to rely on wholesale power purchases and would be subject to the volatility of wholesale markets. If the incremental costs associated with unanticipated changes in loads exceed the incremental revenue received from the sales to the new customers, and Idaho Power is unable to secure timely and full rate relief to recover those increased costs, the resulting imbalance could have an adverse effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.Changes in weather conditions, severe weather, and the impacts of climate change can affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's operating results and cause them to fluctuate seasonally. Idaho Power's electric power sales are seasonal, with demand in Idaho Power's service area peaking during the hot summer months, with a secondary peak during the cold winter months. Electric power demands by irrigation customers in Idaho Power's service area, which are impacted by temperatures and the timing and amount of precipitation, can also create significant seasonal changes in usage. Seasonality of revenues may be further impacted by Idaho Power's tiered rate structure, under which rates charged to customers are often higher during higher-load periods, such as hot summers and cold winters. Market prices for power also often increase significantly during these peak periods, at times when Idaho Power is required to purchase power in the wholesale markets to meet customer demand. While Idaho Power has regulatory mechanisms to help mitigate the impact of weather on power supply costs, there is no assurance that it will continue to receive such regulatory protection in the future. By contrast, when temperatures are relatively mild or where precipitation supplants irrigation systems, loads are often lower as customers are not using electricity for heating and air conditioning or irrigation purposes. Thus, weather conditions and the timing and extent of precipitation can cause IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition to fluctuate seasonally, quarterly, and from year to year. Climate change could also have significant physical effects in Idaho Power’s service area, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, lightning, high winds, icing events, droughts, heat waves, fires, floods, snow loading, and other extreme weather events. These extreme weather events and their associated impacts could damage transmission, distribution, and generation facilities, causing service interruptions and extended or mass outages, increasing costs, and limiting Idaho Power's ability to meet customer energy demand. Sustained drought conditions or decreased snow pack due to reduced precipitation or higher temperatures are likely to decrease power generation from hydropower plants. Prolonged periods of unfavorable wind or solar conditions will temporarily reduce or eliminate the availability of power from wind and solar facilities, respectively. This could limit Idaho Power's ability to meet customer demand for those periods.23Table of Contents                                                            The costs of repairing and replacing infrastructure or any costs related to Idaho Power liability for personal injury, loss of life, and property damage from utility equipment that fails, including as a result of significant weather and weather-related events and the increasing threat of fires, may not be covered by insurance. Costs incurred in connection with such events might also not be recovered through customer rates if the costs incurred are greater than those allowed for recovery by regulators. Idaho Power's customers' energy needs vary with weather and to the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, customers' energy use could increase or decrease. Increased energy use due to weather changes may require Idaho Power to invest in generating assets and transmission and distribution infrastructure, while decreased energy use due to weather changes may result in decreased revenues. Extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand may raise wholesale electricity prices for power that Idaho Power purchases to serve customers, increasing the cost of energy Idaho Power provides to its customers, and at the same time can increase the revenues Idaho Power receives for wholesale market sales of excess generation during regional extreme weather events. Variations in hydropower generation that increase Idaho Power's reliance on market purchases may lead to more costly power supply sources for its customers and reduce benefits from selling surplus hydropower in the wholesale market. The price of power in the wholesale energy markets tends to be higher during periods of high regional demand that tends to occur with weather extremes, which may cause Idaho Power to purchase power in the wholesale market during peak price periods, increasing power supply costs. Idaho Power has in place mechanisms to help mitigate the effects of energy market price volatility, but there is no assurance these mechanisms will continue to be in place or function as intended.In addition, state and federal legislation and regulations have been proposed in recent years and may be implemented in the future, intended to limit the severity and impact of climate change. Proposals have included imposing mandatory reductions in GHG emissions, which could increase Idaho Power’s power supply and compliance costs or require generation facilities to be retired early, resulting in potential stranded costs and write-downs or write-offs if Idaho Power is unable to fully recover investments in such facilities. If financial markets increasingly view climate change or GHG emissions as a financial or investment risk for electric utilities, it could negatively affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's ability to access debt and equity capital markets on favorable terms. For additional information relating to legislation, regulations, and legal proceedings related to environmental matters, see Part II - Item 7 - MD&A - ""Environmental Matters” in this report.Liability from fires could adversely impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's business, financial condition, and results of operations, and Idaho Power's WMP and other protocols may not prevent such liability. Fires alleged to have been caused by Idaho Power's transmission, distribution, or generation infrastructure, or that allegedly result from Idaho Power’s or its contractors’ operating or maintenance practices, could expose Idaho Power to claims for fire suppression and clean-up costs, evacuation costs, fines and penalties, and liability for economic damages, personal injury, loss of life, property damage, and environmental pollution, whether based on claims of negligence, trespass, or otherwise. The risk of wildfires is exacerbated in forested areas where beetle infestations and rising tree mortality rates have caused a significant increase in the quantity of standing dead and dying timber, increasing the risk that such trees may fall from either inside or outside Idaho Power's right-of-way into a powerline igniting a fire and increasing the severity of fires. A significant number of urban-wildland interfaces in and near Idaho Power's service area, and commonly hot, dry summer conditions that may worsen as a result of climate change, increase the likelihood and magnitude of damages that may be caused by fires burning into or allegedly originating from utility equipment. Further, there has been an increasing trend in the degree of annual destruction from wildfires in the western United States, as well as utility companies facing claims for significant damages resulting from wildfires. Idaho Power maintains insurance coverage for such risks, but insurance coverage is subject to terms and limitations and may not be sufficient to cover Idaho Power’s ultimate liability. Coverage limits within wildfire insurance policies could result in material self-insured costs due to self-insured retention amounts under the terms of Idaho Power’s insurance policies. Idaho Power or its contractors and customers could also experience coverage reductions and increased wildfire insurance costs in future years. Idaho Power may be unable to recover costs in excess of insurance through customer rates or regulatory mechanisms and, even if such recovery is possible, it could take several years to collect. If the amount of insurance is insufficient or otherwise unavailable, and if Idaho Power is unable to fully recover in rates the costs of uninsured losses, IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially affected.Idaho Power spends significant resources on initiatives designed to mitigate wildfire risks, including through its WMP, but there is no assurance that the WMP and protocols such as the PSPS will be successful or effective in reducing wildfire-related losses. Idaho Power will face a higher likelihood of wildfires in its service area if it cannot effectively implement its WMP. There also can be no assurance that the WMP and protocols such as the PSPS will be effective. For instance, a wildfire may be ignited and spread even in conditions that do not trigger a PSPS event. Idaho Power's inspections of vegetation near its assets may not detect structural weaknesses within a tree or other issues. If Idaho Power's WMP and protocols are not effective, a wildfire could be ignited and spread. To the extent Idaho Power’s criteria for implementing a PSPS are not sufficient to mitigate the risk of wildfires, Idaho Power does not fully implement a PSPS when criteria are met, due to other overriding factors, or 24Table of Contents                                                            Idaho Power’s regulators mandate changes to, or restrictions on, its criteria or other operational PSPS practices, Idaho Power will face a higher likelihood of wildfires in its service area during high-risk weather conditions.New advances in power generation, energy efficiency, alternative energy sources, or other technologies that impact the power utility industry could decrease customer energy demand and revenues, which could have implications for generation and system planning. Advances in technology and changes in customer demand and preferences in the electric utility industry have encouraged the development of new technologies for power generation, renewable energy, energy storage, customer-owned generation, and energy efficiency. In particular, in recent years the net cost of solar and wind generation and storage technology has decreased significantly, and there are federal and state regulations, laws, and other incentives in place to help further reduce the net cost of solar, wind, and energy storage facilities. There is potential that customer-owned solar power generation systems, could become sufficiently cost-effective and efficient that an increasing number of Idaho Power's customers choose to install such systems on their homes or businesses, which in turn could require changes in the way Idaho Power builds and manages its distribution systems and substantial grid infrastructure costs, and at the same time reduce the demand for and sale of energy. Additionally, considerable emphasis has been placed on energy efficiency, such as LED lighting and high-efficiency appliances. Energy efficiency programs, including programs sponsored by Idaho Power under a directive from state regulatory commissions, are designed to reduce energy use and demand. The introduction of new technologies could pose risks in the form of reduced sales and new business models for energy services. These changes in technology could also alter the channels through which customers buy or utilize energy, including the potential formation of community-based, cooperative ownership or municipal structures, which could reduce Idaho Power's revenues or impact Idaho Power's expenses. A reduction in load, however, would not necessarily reduce Idaho Power's need for ongoing investments in its infrastructure to reliably serve its customers. If Idaho Power is unable to adjust its rate design or maintain adequate regulatory mechanisms allowing for timely cost recovery, declining usage from customer-owned generation sources and energy efficiency could result in under-recovery of Idaho Power's costs and investment in infrastructure, and reduce revenues, which would impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Acts or threats of terrorism, acts of war, social unrest, cyber or physical security attacks, and other malicious acts of individuals or groups seeking to disrupt Idaho Power's operations or the electric power grid or compromise data could adversely impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's business, financial condition, and results of operations. Idaho Power operates in an industry that requires the continuous use and operation of sophisticated information technology and increasingly complex operational technology systems and network infrastructure. Idaho Power's generation and transmission facilities and its grid operations are potential targets for terrorist acts and threats, acts of war, social unrest, cyber and physical security attacks, and other disruptive activities of individuals or groups, including by nation states or nation state-sponsored groups. There have been cyber and physical attacks within the energy industry on energy infrastructure such as electric substations and fuel pipelines in the past with notable reports in the media of electric industry infrastructure specifically being targeted for and impacted by physical attacks more recently, and there are likely to be additional attacks in the future. Idaho Power and its vendors have been subject to, and will likely continue to be subject to, attempts to gain unauthorized access to systems and confidential information, or to disrupt operations. As noted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the utility industry is continuing to experience an increase in the frequency and sophistication of cybersecurity incidents. Some of Idaho Power's facilities are deemed ""critical infrastructure"" under federal standards, in that incapacity or destruction of the facilities could have a debilitating impact on security, reliability, or operability of the bulk electric power system, national economic security, and public health and safety. The fact that infrastructure facilities, such as power generation facilities and electric transmission or distribution facilities, are direct targets of, or potential indirect casualties of, an act of terror or war or cyber or physical attack (whether originating internal to Idaho Power or externally), may affect Idaho Power's operations by limiting the ability to generate, purchase, or transmit power. Idaho Power's electric transmission systems are part of an interconnected regional grid, and therefore, it faces the risk of causing or being subject to a long-term power outage due to grid disturbances or disruptions on a neighboring interconnected grid system. Cyber and physical threats and attacks can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across networks, information systems, and other technologies. Network, information systems, and technology-related events, including those caused by IDACORP or Idaho Power through process breakdowns, human error, security architecture or design vulnerabilities, or by third parties through cyber or physical security attacks, could result in a degradation or disruption in the energy grid and the services of the companies, as well as the ability to record, process, and report customer, business, and financial information. Physical or cyber attacks against key suppliers or service providers could have a similar effect on Idaho Power.Idaho Power's business operations require the continuous availability of information technology systems and network infrastructure, and in the normal course of business, Idaho Power or its vendors collect and store sensitive and confidential customer and employee information and proprietary information of Idaho Power. Idaho Power’s technology systems are 25Table of Contents                                                            dependent upon connectivity to the internet and third-party vendors to host, maintain, modify, and update its systems, which may experience significant system failures or cyber attacks that could compromise the security of Idaho Power’s assets and information. All information technology systems are vulnerable to being disabled, unauthorized access, unintentional defects, user error, errors in system changes, and cybersecurity incidents. Idaho Power is in the process of pursuing complex business system upgrades, and these significant changes increase the risk of system interruption. Any data security breaches, such as misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in Idaho Power's information technology systems or on third-party systems, including customer or employee data, could result in violations of privacy and other laws and associated litigation and liability for damages, fines, and penalties; financial loss to Idaho Power or to its customers; customer dissatisfaction or diminished customer confidence; and damage to Idaho Power’s reputation, all of which could materially affect Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. No security measures can completely shield Idaho Power's systems, infrastructure, and data from vulnerabilities to cyber attacks, human error, intrusions, or other catastrophic events that could result in their failure or reduced functionality, and ultimately the potential loss of sensitive information or the loss of Idaho Power's ability to fulfill critical business functions and provide reliable electric power to customers. Despite the steps Idaho Power may take to detect, mitigate, or eliminate threats and respond to security incidents, the techniques used by those who seek to obtain unauthorized access, and possibly disable or sabotage systems or abscond with information and data, change frequently and Idaho Power may not be able to protect against all such actions. Idaho Power actively monitors developments in cybersecurity and is involved in various related government and industry groups, and the company’s board receives security updates at least quarterly. Although Idaho Power continues to make investments in its cybersecurity program, including personnel, technologies, and training of personnel, there can be no assurance that these systems or their expected functionality will be implemented, maintained, or expanded effectively; nor can security measures completely eliminate the possibility of a cybersecurity breach. Further, the implementation of security guidelines and measures has resulted in, and Idaho Power expects to continue to result in, increased costs.  Terrorist attacks, acts of war, social unrest, cyber and physical security attacks, and similar incidents can also have indirect impacts by creating political, economic, social, or financial market instability, and can cause damage to or interference with Idaho Power’s operating assets, customers, or suppliers. This may result in business interruption, lost revenue, higher commodity prices, disruption in fuel supplies, lower energy consumption, and unstable commodity and financial markets, particularly with respect to electricity and natural gas, any of which may materially adversely affect Idaho Power. These events, and governmental actions in response, could result in a material decrease in revenues and increase costs to protect, repair, and insure Idaho Power's assets and operate its infrastructure, systems, and business.Changes in capital expenditures for infrastructure and the risks associated with permitting and construction of utility infrastructure can significantly affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power’s business is capital intensive and requires significant investments in power supply, transmission, and distribution infrastructure. A significant portion of Idaho Power’s facilities were constructed many years ago, and thus require periodic upgrades and frequent maintenance. Also, short-term and long-term anticipated increases in both the number of customers and the demand for energy require expansion and reinforcement of that infrastructure as described in Idaho Power's 2023 IRP. Idaho Power is not only in the permitting process for two high-voltage transmission line projects, but has also entered into contracts to purchase, own, and operate 304 megawatts of battery storage assets as well as issued RFPs for new resources, which are intended to help meet increasing customer energy demands. Idaho Power expects significant investment in capital improvements and expenditures for infrastructure projects that are subject to usual permitting and construction risks that can adversely affect project costs and the completion time. These risks include, as examples:•the ability to timely obtain labor or materials at reasonable costs;•defaults and delays by suppliers and contractors, including delays for specialty equipment that require significant lead times;•increases in price and limitations on availability of commodities, materials, and equipment; •imposition of tariffs on commodities, materials, and equipment sourced by foreign providers; •equipment, engineering, and design failures;•credit quality of counterparties and suppliers and their ability to meet financial and operational commitments; •unexpected environmental and geological problems;•the effects of adverse weather conditions; •catastrophic events, natural disasters, epidemics, pandemics and other public health or disruptive events that could result in supply chain disruptions, as well as permitting and construction delays;•availability of financing; 26Table of Contents                                                            •the ability to obtain approval from local, state, or federal regulatory and governmental bodies and to comply with permits and land use rights, and environmental constraints; and•delays and costs associated with disputes and litigation with third parties. The occurrence of any of these risks could cause Idaho Power to operate at reduced capacity levels, which in turn could reduce revenues and reliability, increase expenses, or cause Idaho Power to incur penalties. If Idaho Power is unable to complete the permitting or construction of a project, or incurs costs that regulators do not deem prudent, it may be unable to recover its costs in full through rates or on a timely basis. Further, if Idaho Power is unable to secure permits or joint funding commitments to develop transmission infrastructure necessary to serve loads or if other resources become more economical, it may terminate those projects and, as alternatives, seek to develop additional generation facilities within areas where Idaho Power has available transmission capacity or pursue other more costly options to serve loads. To limit the timing-related risks of these projects, Idaho Power may enter into purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals or permits. If any of the projects are canceled for any reason, including Idaho Power's failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals or permits or because the project is no longer economical, Idaho Power could incur significant cancellation penalties under purchase orders or construction contracts. Additionally, termination of a project carries with it the potential for impairment of the associated asset if regulators deny full recovery of project costs. Thus, termination of a project could negatively affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.Demand for power could exceed supply, resulting in deliverability risks and increased costs for, or difficulty in, purchasing capacity in the market or acquiring or constructing additional generation resources and battery storage facilities. Idaho Power's 2023 IRP identified a low-cost preferred resource portfolio and action plan for the next 20-year period that includes adding substantial renewable resources and the conversion from coal to natural gas of two units at the Jim Bridger plant in 2024, the two units at the North Valmy plant in 2026, and the remaining two units at the Jim Bridger plant in 2030. As Idaho Power implements the IRP's action plan, it remains obligated to provide reliable and affordable energy to its customers, but there are certain potential deliverability and cost risks associated with implementation. These risks include, but are not limited to, (1) the failure to timely obtain or construct additional resources to meet forecast needs related to load growth, (2) increased renewable energy generation presenting risks of uncertainty and variability that could be further compounded as neighboring systems transition towards increasing levels of renewable resources, and (3) increased potential resource volatility due to changes in the energy market. During peak periods, power demand could exceed, and on occasion has exceeded, Idaho Power’s available generation capacity, particularly if Idaho Power’s power plants are not performing as anticipated and additional resources and battery storage are not available as needed to meet demand. Competitive market forces or adverse regulatory actions may require Idaho Power to purchase capacity and energy from the market, if such resources are even available for purchase, or build additional resources to meet customers’ energy needs in an expedited manner. If that occurs, Idaho Power may be unable to recover these additional costs and could experience a lag between when costs are incurred and when regulators permit recovery in customers’ rates, which could have negative impacts on operations and cash flows. Factors contributing to lower hydropower generation can increase costs and negatively impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power derives a significant portion of its power supply from its hydropower facilities. During 2023 and 2022, 55 percent and 48 percent, respectively, of Idaho Power's electric power from Idaho Power-owned generation was from hydropower facilities. Due to Idaho Power’s heavy reliance on hydropower generation, the impacts of climate change and factors such as precipitation and snowpack, the timing of run-off, and the availability of water in the Snake River Basin can significantly affect its operations. The combination of a long-term trend of declining Snake River base flows, over-appropriation of water, and periods of drought have led to water rights disputes and proceedings among surface water and ground water irrigators and the State of Idaho. Recharging the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer by diverting surface water to porous locations and permitting it to sink into the aquifer is one approach to the over-appropriation dispute. Diversions from the Snake River for aquifer recharge or the loss of water rights reduce Snake River flows available for hydropower generation. When hydropower generation is reduced, Idaho Power must increase its use of more expensive thermal generating resources and market power purchases; therefore, costs increase and opportunities for wholesale energy sales are reduced, reducing revenues and potentially earnings. Through its power cost adjustment mechanisms, Idaho Power expects to recover most (but not all) of the increase in net power supply costs caused by lower hydropower generation. The timing of recovery of the increased costs, however, may not occur until the subsequent power cost adjustment year, adversely affecting cash flows and liquidity.Idaho Power’s use of coal and natural gas to fuel power generation facilities exposes it to commodity availability and price risk, which can adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition. As part of its normal business operations, Idaho Power purchases coal and natural gas in the open market or under short-term or long-term contracts, often with variable pricing terms. Market prices for coal and natural gas are volatile and influenced by factors 27Table of Contents                                                            impacting supply and demand such as weather conditions, the adequacy and type of generating capacity, fuel transportation availability, economic conditions, regulations related to GHG emissions, changes in technology, moratoriums on federally leased coal, and increases in coal lease costs. Natural gas transportation to Idaho Power's three natural gas plants is limited to one primary pipeline, presenting a heightened possibility of supply constraint and disruptions separate from the risk of counterparty default. Idaho Power's current coal supply arrangements are under long-term contracts for coal originating in Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado, and thus Idaho Power is exposed to risk of disruption of coal production in, or transportation from, those regions. Idaho Power may from time to time enter into new, or renegotiate, these contracts but can provide no assurance that such contracts will be negotiated or renegotiated on satisfactory terms, or at all. There also can be no assurance that counterparties to the natural gas or coal supply agreements will fulfill their obligations to supply natural gas or coal, and they may experience regulatory, financial, or technical problems or unforeseeable events that inhibit their ability to deliver natural gas or coal. Disruptions in transportation of fuel and defaults by coal and natural gas suppliers may cause Idaho Power to seek alternative, and potentially more costly, sources of fuel or rely on other generation sources or wholesale market power purchases. Idaho Power's failure to provide service due to such disruptions may also result in fines, penalties, or cost disallowances through the regulatory process. Idaho Power may not be able to fully or timely recover these increased costs through rates and power cost adjustment mechanisms, which may adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power’s power supply, transmission, and distribution facilities are subject to numerous operational risks unique to it and its industry, including circumstances causing power outages, injuries and property damage, loss of life, and fires. Operating risks associated with Idaho Power's power supply, transmission, and distribution facilities include equipment failures, volatility in fuel and transportation pricing, interruptions in fuel supplies, increased regulatory compliance costs, changes necessitated by environmental legislation or litigation, labor disputes or attrition, accidents and workforce safety matters, environmental damage, property damage, wildfires, acts of terrorism or war or sabotage (both cyber and asset-based), the loss of cost-effective disposal options for solid waste such as coal ash, operator error, and the occurrence of catastrophic events at the facilities. Idaho Power maintains business continuity and disaster recovery plans, but such plans may be inadequate or not function as anticipated, which could result in delayed recovery after any such events. Diminished availability or performance of those facilities could result in reduced customer satisfaction, reputational harm, liability to third parties (including tort liability), and regulatory inquiries and fines. Operation of Idaho Power's owned and co-owned generating stations below expected capacity levels, or unplanned outages at these stations, could cause reduced energy output and lower efficiency levels and result in lost revenues and increased expenses for alternative fuels or wholesale market power purchases. Further, during high-load periods the transmission system in Idaho Power's service area is constrained, limiting the ability to transmit electric energy within the service area and access electric energy from outside the service area. Idaho Power's transmission facilities are also interconnected with those of third parties, and thus operation of Idaho Power's and third-parties' facilities could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events. These transmission constraints and events could result in failure to provide reliable service to customers and the inability to deliver energy from generating facilities to the power grid, and the inability to access lower cost sources of electric energy. Idaho Power also enters into agreements with third-party contractors to perform work on its power supply, transmission, and distribution facilities, and may in some circumstances retain liability for the quality and completion of those contractors’ work, potentially subjecting Idaho Power to penalties, liability for personal injury, loss of life, or property damage, reputational harm, or enforcement actions or liability if a contractor violates applicable laws, rules, regulations, or orders.Accidents, acts of terrorism or war, electrical contacts, fires, explosions, catastrophic failures, general system damage or dysfunction, intentional acts of destruction, uncontrolled release of water from hydropower dams, and other unplanned events related to Idaho Power's infrastructure would increase repair costs and may expose Idaho Power to liability for personal injury, loss of life, and property damage. Idaho Power maintains insurance coverage for such operating and event risks, but insurance coverage is subject to terms and limitations and may not be sufficient to cover Idaho Power’s ultimate liability. Idaho Power may be unable to recover costs in excess of insurance through customer rates or regulatory mechanisms and, even if such recovery is possible, it could take several years to collect. If the amount of insurance is insufficient or otherwise unavailable, and if Idaho Power is unable to fully recover in rates the costs of uninsured losses, IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially affected.Purchases of power mandated by PURPA from renewable energy projects may increase costs and adversely affect Idaho Power's and IDACORP's results of operations and financial condition. Under PURPA, Idaho Power is generally obligated to purchase power from certain renewable energy projects, regardless of the then-current load demand, availability of lower cost generation resources, or wholesale energy market prices. As of December 31, 2023, Idaho Power had contracts mandated under PURPA to purchase energy from 130 online projects with third parties. Absent a need for this generation, these contracts increase the likelihood and frequency that Idaho Power will be required to reduce output from its lower-cost generation resources, which in turn increases power purchase costs and customer rates and impacts Idaho Power's ability to invest in 28Table of Contents                                                            additional generation and earn a reasonable return on rate base in the future. If Idaho Power is unable to timely recover those costs through its rates, power cost adjustment mechanisms, or otherwise, those increased costs may negatively affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's activities are concentrated in one industry and in one region, which exposes it to risks from lack of diversification, regional economic conditions, and regional legislation and regulation. IDACORP and Idaho Power do not have diversified operations or sources of revenue. Idaho Power comprises nearly all of IDACORP's operations, and Idaho Power's business is concentrated solely in the electric power industry. Furthermore, Idaho Power's provision of electric service to retail customers is conducted exclusively in its southern Idaho and eastern Oregon service area. As a result, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's future performance, revenues, and collectability of revenues, as well as expenses, will be affected by regional economic conditions, regulatory and legislative activity, weather conditions, and other events and conditions in its service area and in the electric power industry.  The impacts of a retiring workforce with specialized utility-specific functions and the inability to hire qualified third-party vendors could increase costs and adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power’s operations require a skilled workforce to perform specialized utility functions. Many of these positions, such as linemen, grid operators, engineering and design personnel, and generation plant operators, require extensive, specialized training. Idaho Power does not have employment contracts with its officers or key employees and cannot guarantee that any member of its management or any key employee at the IDACORP parent or any subsidiary level will continue to serve in any capacity for any particular period of time. Employee retention and recruitment may also be negatively impacted by more flexible remote work opportunities, higher pay offered by other employers, or lower cost of living in other areas. The loss of skills and institutional knowledge of experienced employees, the failure to foster an innovative, inclusive, equitable, and diverse environment in order to hire appropriately qualified employees, the costs associated with attracting, training, and retaining such employees to replace an aging and skilled workforce or the inability to do so, and the operational and financial costs of unionization or the attempt to unionize all or part of the companies’ workforce, could have a negative effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power could incur increased costs as a result of such turnover due to a loss of knowledge, errors due to inexperienced employees, substantial training time, loss of productivity, and increased safety and compliance issues.Idaho Power also hires third-party vendors to assist in performing a variety of ordinary business functions, such as power plant maintenance, data warehousing and management, software development and licensing, electric transmission and distribution operations, billing and metering processes, and vegetation management, among other things. In recent years, Idaho Power has experienced increased competition and rising prices for many forms of third-party vendor services. While Idaho Power does not rely entirely on third-party vendors for many of these business functions, the unavailability of such vendors could adversely affect the quality and cost of Idaho Power's electric service and negatively impact its results of operation.Co-owners of Idaho Power’s generation and transmission assets may have unaligned goals and positions due to the effects of legislation, regulations, capital requirements, load growth amounts, changes in our industry, or other factors, which could at times adversely impact Idaho Power’s ability to construct and operate those facilities in a manner most suitable to Idaho Power. Idaho Power owns certain of its generation and transmission assets jointly with other owners, with varying ownership interests in such facilities, and Idaho Power plans to develop and own assets jointly in the future. While there are advantages to joint ownership of resources, there are also restrictions imposed by the joint ownership and operating agreements for those facilities that provide rights, but also restrictions, on when and how the facilities are constructed and on how they are operated. Changes in the nature of Idaho Power’s industry and the economic viability of certain plants and facilities, including impacts resulting from types and availability of other resources, fuel costs, and legislation and regulation, together with timing considerations related to expiration of permits or leases or other agreements for such facilities and other factors, could result in unaligned positions among co-owners. While Idaho Power negotiates and enforces its rights and obligations thoughtfully, differences in the co-owners’ willingness or ability to continue their participation or the timing of facility construction, modification, or decommissioning could lead to restrictions and disruptions to operations, adverse financial impacts to Idaho Power, and/or uncertainty related to the resulting cost recovery of such assets. Legal and Compliance RisksLegal and compliance risk relates to risks arising from government and regulatory action and from legal proceedings and compliance with applicable laws, rules, orders, regulations, policies, and procedures, including those related to financial reporting, environment, health, and safety, and potential changes in legal requirements.Changes in legislation, regulation, and government policy may have a material adverse effect on IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s business in the future. Specific legislative and regulatory proposals and recently enacted legislation that could have a 29Table of Contents                                                            material impact on IDACORP and Idaho Power include, but are not limited to, tax reform, utility regulation, carbon-reduction initiatives, infrastructure renewal programs, climate change and environmental regulation, and modifications to accounting and public company reporting requirements. Further, the proposals and new legislation could have an impact on the rate of growth of Idaho Power’s customers and their willingness to expand operations and increase electric service requirements. Under the current Presidential Administration, Idaho Power expects laws, regulations, and policies relating to environmental compliance to continue to change and require IDACORP and Idaho Power and some of their customers to modify their business strategy or restrict activities and projects, potentially subjecting them to increased compliance costs. For example, in January 2021, the United States rejoined the Paris Agreement on climate change that requires commitments related to GHG emissions, among other things, and the Presidential Administration has announced ambitious clean energy initiatives. Many states and localities may continue to pursue climate policies in addition to federal mandates. The state of Oregon, for instance, has been pursuing cap-and-trade legislation for GHG emissions. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if such non-compliance is caused by factors outside of Idaho Power's control, may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties or fines, or government enforcement actions. Idaho Power could also become subject to climate change lawsuits and an adverse outcome could require substantial expenditures and could possibly require payment of damages. IDACORP and Idaho Power expect federal, state, and local governmental authorities to implement various recent and expected future executive orders from the Presidential Administration and are unable to predict whether and to what extent such actions will meaningfully change existing legislative and regulatory environments relevant to the companies, or if any such changes would have a net positive or negative impact on the companies. Idaho Power is unable to estimate the costs of complying with such legislative or regulatory changes due to the uncertainties associated with the nature and implementation of the changes, and may not be able to recover the associated costs. To the extent that such changes have a negative impact on the companies or Idaho Power’s customers, including as a result of related uncertainty, these changes may materially and adversely impact IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.Changes in income tax laws and regulations, or differing interpretation or enforcement of applicable laws by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdictions, could have a material adverse impact on IDACORP’s or Idaho Power’s financial condition and results of operations. IDACORP and Idaho Power must make judgments and interpretations about the application of the law when determining the provision for income taxes. Amounts of income tax-related assets and liabilities involve judgments and estimates of the timing and probability of recognition of income, deductions, and tax credits, which are subject to challenge by taxing authorities. These judgments may include estimates for potential outcomes regarding tax positions that may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities. Disputes over interpretations of tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority in examination, upon appeal, or through litigation. The outcome of potential future income tax proceedings or laws, or the state public utility commissions' treatment of those outcomes, could differ materially from the amounts IDACORP and Idaho Power record prior to conclusion of those proceedings, and the difference could negatively affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s earnings and cash flows. Further, in some instances, the treatment from a ratemaking perspective of any net income tax expense (including from increased tax rates) or benefit could be different than IDACORP or Idaho Power anticipate or request from applicable state regulatory commissions, which could have a negative effect on their financial condition and results of operations. In addition, Idaho Power uses the regulatory flow-through income tax accounting method as described in Note 1 - ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report, and potential changes in income tax laws or interpretations may impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's income taxes and reporting obligations differently than most other companies.IDACORP's and Idaho Power’s businesses are subject to an extensive set of environmental laws, rules, and regulations, which could impact their operations and costs of operations, potentially rendering some generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate, and could increase the costs and alter the timing of major projects. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's operations are subject to a number of federal, state, and local environmental statutes, rules, and regulations relating to climate change, air and water quality, natural resources, endangered species and wildlife, renewable energy, and health and safety. Many of these laws and regulations are described in Part II - Item 7 - MD&A - ""Environmental Matters” in this report. These laws and regulations generally require IDACORP and Idaho Power to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, and other approvals, including through substantial investment in pollution controls, and may be enforced by both public officials and private individuals. Some of these regulations are pending, changing, or subject to interpretation, and failure to comply may result in penalties, mandatory operational changes, and other adverse consequences, including costs associated with defending against claims by governmental authorities or private parties and complying with new operating requirements. Idaho Power devotes significant resources to environmental monitoring, pollution control equipment, and mitigation projects to comply with existing and anticipated environmental regulations. However, it is possible that federal, state and local authorities could attempt to enforce more stringent standards, stricter regulation, and more expansive application of environmental regulations. 30Table of Contents                                                            Environmental regulations have created the need for Idaho Power to install new pollution control equipment at, and may cause Idaho Power to perform environmental remediation on, its owned and co-owned power generation facilities, often at a substantial cost. Compliance with environmental regulations can significantly increase capital spending, operating costs, and plant outages, and can negatively affect the affordability of Idaho Power's services for customers. Idaho Power cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures necessary to comply with these environmental laws and regulations, although Idaho Power expects the expenditures could be substantial. In some cases, the costs to obtain permits and ensure facilities are in compliance may be prohibitively expensive. If the costs of compliance with new regulations renders the generating facilities uneconomical to maintain or operate, Idaho Power would need to identify alternative resources for power, potentially in the form of new generation and transmission facilities, market power purchases, demand-side management programs, or a combination of these and other methods. Furthermore, Idaho Power may not be able to obtain or maintain all environmental regulatory approvals necessary for operation of its existing infrastructure or construction of new infrastructure. In addition, some environmental regulations are currently subject to litigation and not yet final. As a result of this uncertainty, approaches to comply with the regulations, including available control technologies or other allowed compliance measures, are unpredictable and Idaho Power cannot foresee the potential impacts these regulations would have on Idaho Power's operations or financial condition. In 2019, Idaho Power announced its long-term goal to serve customers with 100 percent clean energy by 2045, and Idaho Power has short-term and medium-term goals for CO2 emission reductions, which could impact infrastructure resource decisions and costs. Idaho Power's ability to achieve these targets are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the company's regulatory obligation to serve its customers, the availability and cost of new generation resources, legal and permitting requirements, system operation and energy integration, and grid balancing, among others. Additionally, Idaho Power is not guaranteed timely or full recovery through customer rates of costs associated with environmental regulations, environmental compliance, its clean energy initiatives, plant closures, or clean-up of contamination. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if Idaho Power fails to obtain, maintain, or comply with any such approval, construction and/or operation of Idaho Power's generation or transmission facilities could be delayed, halted, terminated, or subjected to additional costs. For further discussion of environmental matters that may affect Idaho Power, see ""Environmental Matters"" in Item 7 - MD&A in this report.Obligations imposed in connection with hydropower license renewals and permitting may require large capital expenditures, increase operating costs, reduce hydropower generation, and negatively affect IDACORP's or Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition. Since 2003, Idaho Power has been engaged in an effort to renew its federal license for its largest hydropower generation source, the HCC. Relicensing and ongoing permitting requirements include an extensive public review process that involves numerous natural resource issues and environmental conditions. The existence of endangered and threatened species in the watershed may result in major operational changes to the region’s hydropower projects, which may be reflected in hydropower licenses, including for the HCC and the American Falls facility. Federal land use agencies may also impose conditions under the FPA that could impact costs and operations if FERC deems them necessary for the adequate protection and utilization of the public lands and reservations of the United States. In addition, new agency requirements and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to hydropower facilities, which could further increase required expenditures for flood control, marine life recovery and endangered species protection and may reduce the amount of hydropower generation available to meet Idaho Power’s generation requirements. Idaho Power cannot predict the requirements that might be imposed during the relicensing and permitting process, the financial impact of those requirements, whether a new multi-year license will ultimately be issued, and whether the IPUC or OPUC will allow recovery through rates of the substantial costs incurred in connection with the licensing process and subsequent compliance. Imposition of onerous conditions in the relicensing and permitting processes could result in Idaho Power incurring significant capital expenditures, increase operating costs (including power purchase costs), and reduce hydropower generation, which could negatively affect results of operations and financial condition.Idaho Power could be subject to penalties, reputational harm, and operational changes if it violates mandatory reliability and security requirements, which could adversely impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition. As an owner and operator of a bulk power transmission system, Idaho Power is subject to mandatory reliability and security standards issued by the FERC and other regulators. The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability, security, and market interface principles. Compliance with reliability standards subjects Idaho Power to higher operating costs and increased capital expenditures. Idaho Power has received in recent years notices of violations from, and regularly self-reports reliability standard compliance issues to, the FERC, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and the Western Electricity Coordinating Council. Potential monetary and non-monetary penalties for a violation of FERC regulations may be substantial, and in some circumstances monetary penalties may exceed $1.5 million per day per violation. As a utility with a large customer base, Idaho Power is subject to adverse publicity focused on the reliability of its services and the speed with which it is able to respond to electric outages caused by storm damage or other unanticipated events. Adverse publicity could harm the reputations of IDACORP and 31Table of Contents                                                            Idaho Power; may make state legislatures, utility commissions, and other regulatory authorities less likely to view the companies in a favorable light; and may cause Idaho Power to be subject to less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes or increased regulatory oversight. The imposition of any of the foregoing on Idaho Power for its actual or alleged failure to comply with reliability and security requirements could also have a negative effect on its and IDACORP’s results of operations and financial condition.IDACORP and Idaho Power are subject to costs and other effects of legal and regulatory proceedings, disputes, and claims. From time to time in the normal course of business, IDACORP and Idaho Power are subject to various lawsuits, regulatory proceedings, disputes, and claims that could result in adverse judgments or settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, or other adverse consequences. These matters are subject to a number of uncertainties, and management is often unable to predict the outcome of such matters; resulting liabilities could exceed amounts currently reserved or insured against with respect to such matter. The legal costs and final resolution of matters in which IDACORP or Idaho Power are involved could have reputational impact and a short- or long-term negative effect on their financial condition and results of operations. Addressing any adverse publicity or governmental scrutiny could be time consuming and expensive, regardless of the basis of the assertions being made, and could impact Idaho Power's relationship with employees, stakeholders, and regulators. Further, the terms of resolution could require the companies to change their operational practices and procedures, which could also have a negative effect on their financial positions and results of operations.Changes in accounting standards or rules may impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial results and disclosures. The Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC have made and may continue to make changes to accounting standards that impact presentation and disclosures of financial condition and results of operations. Further, new accounting orders issued by the FERC could significantly impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's reported financial condition. IDACORP and Idaho Power do not have any control over the impact these changes may have on their financial conditions or results of operations nor the timing of such changes. Idaho Power meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in its financial statements and to defer certain costs as regulatory assets until those costs are collected in rates, and to defer some items as regulatory liabilities. If recovery of these amounts ceases to be probable, if Idaho Power determines that it no longer meets the criteria for applying regulatory accounting or if accounting rules change to no longer provide for regulatory assets and liabilities, Idaho Power could be required to eliminate some or all of those regulatory assets or liabilities. Any of these circumstances could result in write-offs and have a material effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power’s financial condition and results of operations. Financial and Investment RisksFinancial and investment risks relate to IDACORP's and Idaho Power's ability to meet financial obligations and mitigate exposure to market risks, including liquidity risks and the ability to raise capital and cost of funding, risks related to credit ratings, credit risk, liquidity, interest rates, and commodity prices. Volatility or disruptions in the financial markets, failure of IDACORP or Idaho Power to satisfy conditions necessary for obtaining loans or issuing debt securities, and denial of regulatory authority to issue debt or equity securities, may negatively affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s ability to access capital and/or increase their cost of borrowing and ability to execute on their strategic plans. IDACORP and Idaho Power use credit facilities, commercial paper markets, long-term debt, and equity securities as significant sources of liquidity and funding for operating and capital requirements and debt maturities not satisfied by operating cash flow. Credit facilities represent commitments by the participating banks to make loans and issue letters of credit. However, the ability and obligation of the participating banks to make those loans and issue letters of credit is subject to specified conditions and volatility or disruptions in the financial markets could affect the companies' ability to obtain debt financing or draw upon or renew existing credit facilities on favorable terms and comply with debt covenants. Idaho Power's ability to issue long-term debt is also subject to a number of conditions included in an indenture, and Idaho Power's ability to issue long-term debt, commercial paper, and equity securities is subject to the availability of purchasers willing to purchase the securities under reasonable terms or at all. Because of these limitations, IDACORP and Idaho Power may be unable to issue commercial paper, short-term or long-term debt, or equity securities on reasonable terms or at all. Higher interest rates on short-term borrowings with variable interest rates could also have an adverse effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's operating results. Changes in interest rates may also impact the fair value of the debt securities in Idaho Power's pension funds, as well as Idaho Power's ability to earn a return on short-term investments of excess cash. Also, while the credit facilities represent a contractual obligation to make loans, one or more of the participating banks may default on their obligations to make loans under, or may withdraw from, the credit facilities. Idaho Power is required to obtain regulatory approval in Idaho, Oregon, and Wyoming in order to borrow money or to issue securities and is therefore dependent on the public utility commissions of those states to issue favorable orders in a timely 32Table of Contents                                                            manner to permit them to finance their operations, capital expenditures, and debt maturities. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's credit facilities consist of revolving lines of credit not to exceed an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of $100 million and $400 million, respectively (Credit Facilities). Each of the Credit Facilities includes a financial covenant that limits the amount of debt that can be outstanding as a percentage of total capital, and Idaho Power's long-term debt has also been issued under an indenture that contains a number of financial covenants. The companies must also make specified representations in connection with requests for loans and it is possible that they may be unable to do so at the time of such request, which would limit or eliminate the obligation of the banks to provide loans. Failure to maintain these representations and covenants could preclude IDACORP and Idaho Power from issuing commercial paper, borrowing under their Credit Facilities, or issuing long-term debt, and could trigger a default and repayment obligation under debt instruments, which could limit their ability to pursue certain projects, acquisitions, or improvements, to support future growth, and adversely impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. A downgrade in IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s credit ratings could affect the companies’ ability to access capital, increase their cost of borrowing, and require the companies to post collateral with transaction counterparties. Credit rating agencies periodically review the corporate credit ratings and long-term ratings of IDACORP and Idaho Power. These ratings are premised on financial ratios and performance, the regulatory environment and rate mechanisms, the effectiveness of management, resource risks and power supply costs, and other factors. IDACORP and Idaho Power also have borrowing arrangements that rely on the ability of the banks to fund loans or support commercial paper, a principal source of short-term financing. In addition, IDACORP's or Idaho Power's credit ratings may change as a result of the differing methodologies or change in the methodologies used by the various rating agencies. Downgrades of IDACORP’s or Idaho Power’s credit ratings, or those affecting relationship banks, could limit the companies’ ability to access short- and long-term capital under reasonable terms or at all, reduce the pool of potential lenders, increase borrowing costs under existing Credit Facilities, limit access to the commercial paper market, require the companies to pay a higher interest rate on their debt, limit the ability of IDACORP to declare and make dividends, and require the companies to post additional performance assurance collateral with transaction counterparties. If access to capital were to become significantly constrained or costs of capital increased significantly due to lowered credit ratings, prevailing industry conditions, regulatory constraints, the volatility of the capital markets, or other factors, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions (including generating capacity and transmission assets, which may be necessary for future growth), liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.Stakeholder actions and increased regulatory activity related to ESG matters, particularly global climate change and reducing GHG emissions, could negatively impact IDACORP and Idaho Power. The power and gas utility industry is facing increasing stakeholder scrutiny related to ESG matters. Recently, Idaho Power has seen a rise in certain stakeholders, such as investors, customers, suppliers, employees, and lenders, placing increasing importance on the impact and social cost associated with climate change. Customers, suppliers, or other stakeholders could pursue, and in some cases have pursued, alternatives to Idaho Power's services or business as a result of their ESG-related expectations. GHG emissions, including, most significantly CO2, could be further restricted in the future in response to additional state and federal regulatory requirements, increased scrutiny, and changing stakeholder expectations with respect to environmental and climate change programs, judicial decisions, and international accords. If new emissions reduction rules were to become effective, they could result in significant additional compliance costs that could negatively impact Idaho Power's future financial position, results of operations, and cash flows if such costs are not timely recovered through regulated rates. Moreover, the possibility exists that stricter laws, regulations, or enforcement policies could significantly increase compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary. In addition, the increasing focus on climate change and stricter regulatory and legal requirements may result in Idaho Power facing adverse reputational risks associated with certain of its operations producing GHG emissions. If Idaho Power is unable to satisfy the increasing climate-related expectations of certain stakeholders, IDACORP and Idaho Power may suffer reputational harm, which could cause IDACORP’s stock price to decrease or cause certain investors and financial institutions not to purchase the companies’ debt or equity securities or otherwise provide the companies with capital or credit on favorable terms, which may cause IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s cost of capital to increase.Idaho Power’s energy risk management policy and programs relating to economically hedging commodity exposures and credit risk may not always perform as intended, and as a result, IDACORP and Idaho Power may suffer losses. Idaho Power enters into transactions to buy and sell power, natural gas, and transmission service, enters into transactions to hedge its positions in coal, natural gas, power, and other commodities, and enters into economic hedge transactions to mitigate in part exposure to variable commodity prices. IDACORP and Idaho Power could recognize losses as a result of volatility in the market value of these contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform. The derivative instruments used for hedging might not offset the underlying exposure being mitigated as intended, due to pricing inefficiencies or other terms of the derivative instruments, and any such failure to mitigate exposure could result in losses. Certain of Idaho Power's purchase or sale, hedging, and derivative agreements may result in the receipt of, or posting of, collateral with counterparties. Fluctuations in 33Table of Contents                                                            commodity prices that lead to the posting of collateral with counterparties negatively impact liquidity, and downgrades in Idaho Power's credit ratings may lead to additional collateral posting requirements. In 2023, Idaho Power recorded losses on economic hedges of $16.2 million, compared with $68.5 million of gains in 2022. At times, Idaho Power’s energy risk management policy results in Idaho Power entering into economic hedges in an environment where prices are high, and if prices are lower at the time the economic hedge settles, Idaho Power will record losses on the economic hedges. Depending on the volume of economic hedges and the degree of price volatility, those losses can be substantial, and the power cost adjustment mechanisms generally provide that Idaho Power will incur a portion of those losses. Forecasts of future fuel needs and loads and available resources to meet those loads are inherently uncertain and may cause Idaho Power to over- or under-hedge actual resource needs, exposing the company to market risk on the over- or under-hedged position. To the extent that commodity markets are illiquid, Idaho Power may not be able to execute its risk management strategies, which could result in undesired over-exposure to unhedged positions that Idaho Power may not be able to collect in customer rates. The FERC may take action to limit volatility in the energy market by imposing price limits or other market restrictions to control market-based rate sales, which could adversely affect the companies' financial results. As a result, risk management actions, or the failure or inability to manage commodity availability and price and counterparty risk, may adversely affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power has additional indirect credit exposures to financial institutions in the form of letters of credit provided as security by power suppliers under various purchased power contracts and by vendors for infrastructure development projects. If any of the credit ratings of the letter of credit issuers were to drop below investment grade, the vendor or supplier would need to replace the security with an acceptable substitute, which may be impracticable and may expose Idaho Power to losses resulting from a vendor or supplier default. If the security were not replaced, the party could be in default under the contract and Idaho Power's remedies for default may be inadequate to fully compensate Idaho Power for its losses. Further, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a counterparty to commodity or other transactions could impair Idaho Power’s ability to collect amounts receivable from those counterparties, potentially including the ability to collect or retain collateral posted by a counterparty. Idaho Power is a participant in the energy markets, including the Western EIM, and engages in direct and indirect power purchase and sale transactions in connection with that participation. The Western EIM has collateral posting requirements based on established credit criteria, but there is no assurance the collateral will be sufficient to cover obligations that counterparties may owe each other in the Western EIM and any such credit losses could be socialized to all Western EIM participants, including Idaho Power. A significant failure of a participant in the Western EIM to make payments when due on its obligations could have a ripple effect on various Idaho Power counterparties in the power, gas, and derivative markets if those counterparties experience ancillary liquidity issues, and could generally result in a decline in the ability of Idaho Power’s counterparties to perform on their obligations. The performance of pension and postretirement benefit plan investments, increasing health care costs, and other factors impacting plan costs and funding obligations could adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations - primarily cash flows and liquidity. Idaho Power provides a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering most employees, as well as a defined benefit postretirement benefit plan (consisting of health care and death benefits) that covers eligible retirees. Costs of providing these benefits are based in part on the value of the plans' assets and, therefore, adverse investment performance for these assets or the failure to maintain sustained growth in pension investments over time could increase Idaho Power’s plan costs and funding requirements related to the plans. Idaho Power's self-insured costs of health care benefits for eligible employees and retirees have increased in recent years and Idaho Power believes that future legislative changes related to the provision of health care benefits and other external market conditions and factors, could cause such costs to continue to rise. As benefit costs continue to rise, there is no assurance that the IPUC and OPUC will continue to allow recovery. The key actuarial assumptions that affect pension funding obligations are the expected long-term return on plan assets and the discount rate used in determining future benefit obligations. Idaho Power evaluates the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis, taking into account changes in market conditions, trends, and future expectations. Estimates of future investment market performance, changes in interest rates, and other factors Idaho Power and its actuary firms use to develop the actuarial assumptions are inherently uncertain, and actual results could vary significantly from the estimates. Changes in demographics, including timing of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase Idaho Power's plan costs and funding requirements. Future pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments are also subject to the impacts of changes in legislation. Depending on the timing of contributions to the plans and Idaho Power's ability to recover costs through rates, cash contributions to the plans could reduce the cash available for the companies' businesses and payment of dividends. For additional information regarding Idaho Power's funding obligations under its benefit plans, see Note 11 - ""Benefit Plans"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. 34Table of Contents                                                            If the assumptions underlying coal mine reclamation at Bridger Coal Company and related forecast trust fund growth are materially inaccurate, Idaho Power’s costs could be greater than anticipated or be incurred sooner than anticipated. BCC, an indirect jointly-owned investment of Idaho Power located in the state of Wyoming, uses surface mining to extract coal to be used for power generation at the Jim Bridger plant. The federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act and state laws and regulations establish operational, reclamation, bonding, and closure obligations and standards for mining of coal. BCC’s estimate of reclamation liability and bonding obligations is reviewed periodically by Idaho Power’s management committee, audit committee of the board of directors, external and internal auditors, and by government regulators. Idaho Power funds a trust and posts collateral in the form of a surety bond purchased jointly with the co-owner of BCC to cover such projected mine reclamation costs pursuant to the laws of the state of Wyoming. The trust funds are invested in debt and equity securities and poor performance of these investments would reduce the amount of funds available for their intended purpose, which could require Idaho Power to make additional cash contributions. If actual costs related to those obligations exceed estimates, government regulations relating to those obligations change significantly or unexpected cash funding obligations are required, IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.As a holding company, IDACORP does not have its own operating income and must rely on the cash flows from its subsidiaries to pay dividends and make debt payments. IDACORP is a holding company with no significant operations of its own, and its primary assets are shares or other ownership interests of its subsidiaries, primarily Idaho Power. IDACORP’s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts to IDACORP, whether through dividends, loans, or other means. The ability of IDACORP’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to IDACORP depends on several factors, including each subsidiary's actual and projected earnings and cash flow, capital requirements and general financial condition, regulatory restrictions, tax obligations, covenants contained in credit facilities to which they are parties, and the prior rights of holders of their existing and future first mortgage bonds and other debt or equity securities. Further, the amount and payment of dividends is at the discretion of the board of directors, which may reduce or cease payment of dividends at any time. See Note 6 - ""Common Stock"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a further description of restrictions on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's payment of dividends.The market price of IDACORP's common stock may be volatile. The market price of IDACORP's common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to factors such as the following, some of which are beyond its control:•variations in IDACORP and Idaho Power's quarterly operating results;•operating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts, and investors and other impacts from the risks identified in this ""Risk Factors
"" section and elsewhere in this report;•changes in expectations as to future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts or investors;•developments generally affecting IDACORP and Idaho Power's industry;•announcements by IDACORP and Idaho Power of significant contracts, acquisitions, joint ventures, or capital commitments;•announcements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against IDACORP or Idaho Power;•favorable or adverse regulatory or legislative developments;•IDACORP's dividend policy;•change in IDACORP or Idaho Power's management;•future sales of IDACORP's equity or equity-linked securities; and•general domestic and international economic conditions.In addition, the stock market in general has experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of IDACORP's common stock.IDACORP's charter and bylaws and Idaho law could delay or prevent a change in control that shareholders may favor. The terms of some of the provisions in IDACORP's articles of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of Idaho law could delay or prevent a change in control that shareholders may favor or may impede the ability of shareholders to change IDACORP's management. In particular, the provisions of IDACORP's articles of incorporation and bylaws authorize issuance of up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock without further action by shareholders; limit the shareholders’ right to remove directors, fill vacancies and change the number of directors; regulate how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholders’ meetings; and require a supermajority vote of shareholders to amend certain provisions. IDACORP is also subject to the provisions of the Idaho Control Share Acquisition Act and the Idaho Business Combination Act, which provide for certain procedures and restrictions in connection with acquisitions or business combinations.35Table of Contents                                                            Statutory and regulatory factors will limit another party’s ability to acquire IDACORP and could deprive shareholders of the opportunity to gain a takeover premium for their shares of common stock. Even if IDACORP's board of directors favors a sale of the company, a sale would require approval of a number of federal and state regulatory agencies, including the FERC, the IPUC, the OPUC, and the WPSC. The approval process could be lengthy and the outcome uncertain, which may deter otherwise interested parties from proposing or attempting a business combination"
0,IDA,IDACORP INC,2023-02-16,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS IDACORP and Idaho Power operate in a highly regulated industry and business environment that involves significant risks, many of which are beyond the companies' control. The circumstances and factors set forth below should not be considered a complete list of potential risks that the companies may encounter. These risk factors, as well as additional risks and uncertainties either not known as of the date of this report or that are currently believed to not be material to the business, may have a material impact on the business, financial condition, or results of operations of IDACORP and Idaho Power and could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in any forward-looking statements. These risk factors, as well as other information in this report, including without limitation, in the ""Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"" and Part II - Item 7 - ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" (MD&A), and in other reports the companies file with the SEC, should be considered carefully when making any investment decisions relating to IDACORP or Idaho Power. Below are certain important utility-specific regulatory, operational, legal and compliance, financial and investment, and general business risks that may cause IDACORP's and Idaho Power's future business results to be different than anticipated as of the date of this report. Utility-Specific Regulatory RisksUtility-specific regulatory risk includes the risks that federal, state, or local regulators may impose additional requirements and costs on Idaho Power and the utility industry, reduce authorized rates of return or otherwise adversely affect recovery of costs and the opportunity to earn a return on investments, or require Idaho Power as a utility to make adverse changes to its business models, strategies, and practices. State or federal regulators may not approve customer rates that provide timely or sufficient recovery of Idaho Power's costs or allow Idaho Power to earn a reasonable rate of return, which could adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. The prices that the Idaho Public Utilities Commission (IPUC) and Public Utility Commission of Oregon (OPUC) authorize Idaho Power to charge customers for its retail services, and the tariff rate that the FERC permits Idaho Power to charge for its transmission services, are significant factors influencing IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s business, results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition. Idaho Power's ability to recover its costs and earn a reasonable rate of return can be affected by many regulatory factors, including the time between when Idaho Power incurs costs and when Idaho Power recovers those costs in customers’ rates (often called ""regulatory lag"" in the utility industry), and differences between the costs included in rates and the amount of actual costs incurred. Idaho Power expects to incur increasing costs, which is likely to occur before the IPUC, OPUC, or FERC approve the recovery of those costs, such as construction costs for new facilities and transmission resources, costs associated with changes in the long-term cost-effectiveness or operating conditions of Idaho Power's assets that could result in early retirements of utility facilities, costs of compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements, fuel and wholesale power costs, and increased funding levels of Idaho Power's defined benefit pension plan. The IPUC, OPUC, and FERC may not allow Idaho Power to recover some or all of those costs or costs that have already been deferred as regulatory assets if they find Idaho Power did not reasonably or prudently incur those costs or for other reasons. The IPUC and OPUC may adopt different methods of calculating the allocation of the total utility costs in their respective jurisdictions, resulting in certain costs excluded in both states. Ratemaking has generally been premised on estimates of historic costs based on a test year, so if a given year’s actual costs are higher than historic costs, rates may not be sufficient to cover actual costs. While rate regulation is also premised on the assumption that rates established are fair, just, and reasonable, regulators have considerable discretion in applying this standard. Economic, political, legislative, public policy, or regulatory pressures may lead stakeholders to seek rate reductions or refunds, limits on rate increases, or lower allowed rates of return on investments for Idaho Power. The ratemaking process typically involves multiple intervening parties, including governmental bodies, consumer advocacy groups, and customers, generally with the common objective of limiting rate increases or even reducing rates. In the past, Idaho Power has been denied recovery, or required to defer recovery pending the next general rate case, including denials or deferrals related to capital expenditures for long-term project expenses. Adverse outcomes in regulatory proceedings, or significant regulatory lag, may cause Idaho Power to incur unrecovered project costs or result in cancellation of projects, or to record an impairment of its assets or otherwise adversely affect cash flows and earnings. This may also result in lower credit ratings, reduced access to capital, higher financing costs, and reductions or delays in planned capital expenditures.For additional information relating to Idaho Power's state and federal regulatory framework and regulatory matters, see Part I - Item 1 - ""Business - Utility Operations,"" Part II - Item 7 - MD&A - ""Regulatory Matters,"" and Note 3 - ""Regulatory Matters"" to the consolidated financial statements of Part II - Item 8 in this report.23Table of Contents                                                  Idaho Power's regulatory cost recovery mechanisms may not function as intended and are subject to change or elimination, which may adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power has power cost adjustment mechanisms in its Idaho and Oregon jurisdictions and a fixed cost adjustment (FCA) mechanism in Idaho. The power cost adjustment mechanisms track Idaho Power’s actual net power supply costs (primarily fuel and purchased power less wholesale energy sales) and compare these amounts to net power supply costs being recovered in retail rates. A majority of the differences between these two amounts is deferred for future recovery from, or refund to, customers through rates. Volatility in power supply costs continues to be significant, in large part due to fluctuations in hydropower generation conditions, fuel cost variability from supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures, general supply and demand economics for fuel and power, the impact of high costs for the purchase of renewable energy under mandatory long-term contracts, and market price variability for the purchase of power from third parties based on seasonal demands and transmission system constraints. While the power cost adjustment mechanisms function to mitigate the potentially adverse impact on net income of power supply cost volatility, the mechanisms do not eliminate the cash flow impact of that volatility. When power costs rise above the level recovered in current retail rates, Idaho Power incurs the costs but recovery of those costs is deferred to a subsequent collection period, which can adversely affect Idaho Power’s operating cash flow and liquidity until those costs are recovered from customers. The FCA mechanism is a decoupling mechanism that allows Idaho Power to charge Idaho residential and small commercial customers when it recovers less than the base level of fixed costs per customer that the IPUC authorized for recovery in the most recent general rate case. The power cost and FCA mechanisms are generally subject to change at the discretion of applicable state regulators, who could decide to modify or eliminate either mechanism in a manner that adversely impacts IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.  Operational RisksOperational risk relates to risks arising from the systems, assets, processes, people, and external factors that affect the operation of IDACORP's or Idaho Power's businesses.Changes in customer growth and customer usage may negatively affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's business, financial condition, and results of operations. Changes in the number of customers and customers' use of electricity are affected by a number of factors, such as population growth or decline in Idaho Power's service area, expansion or loss of service area, changes in customer needs and expectations, adoption rates of energy efficiency measures, customer-generated power such as from solar panels and gas-fired generators, demand-side management requirements, regulation or deregulation, and adverse economic conditions. Continued inflationary pressures, or an economic downturn, or a recession could also negatively impact customer use and reduce revenues and cash flows, thus adversely affecting results of operations. Many electric utilities, including Idaho Power, have experienced a decline in usage per customer, in part attributable to energy efficiency activities. State or federal regulations may be enacted to encourage or require mandatory energy conservation or technological advances that increase energy efficiency, which could further reduce usage per customer. Also, changing customer needs and expectations and increased competition from customer-owned generation could lead to lower customer satisfaction, reduced loyalty, difficulty in obtaining rate increases, legislation to deregulate electric service, and customers seeking alternative sources of energy and electric service. If customers choose to generate their own energy, discontinue a portion or all service from Idaho Power, or replace electric power for heating with natural gas, demand for Idaho Power's energy may decline and adversely impact the affordability of its services for remaining customers. While Idaho Power has recently experienced a net growth in usage due to an increase in the number of customers, when adjusted for the impacts of weather, the average monthly usage on a per customer basis for Idaho Power's residential customers has declined from 1,032 kilowatt-hour (kWh) in 2012 to 929 kWh in 2022. Rate mechanisms, such as the Idaho FCA for residential and small commercial customers, are designed to address the financial disincentive associated with promoting energy efficiency activities, but there is no assurance that the mechanism will result in full or timely collection of Idaho Power's fixed costs, which are currently collected in large part through the company's volume-based energy rates that are based on historical sales volume. Any undercollection of fixed costs would adversely impact revenues, earnings, and cash flows. The formation of municipal utilities or similar entities for distribution systems within Idaho Power's service area could also result in a load decrease. The loss of loads resulting from some of these events may result in excess infrastructure and stranded costs and require IDACORP and Idaho Power to modify or eliminate large generation, storage, or transmission projects. This could in turn result in reduced revenues as well as write-downs or write-offs if regulators determine that the costs of the projects were incurred imprudently, which could have a material adverse impact on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Conversely, if Idaho Power were to experience an unanticipated increase in the demand for energy through, for example, the rapid addition of new industrial and commercial customers or population growth in the service area, Idaho Power may be required to rely on higher-cost purchased power to meet peak system demand and may need to accelerate investment in additional generation or transmission resources. Idaho Power's 2021 Integrated Resource Plan's (IRP) preferred resource 24Table of Contents                                                 portfolio and action plan included a need to acquire significant generation and storage resources to meet forecasted increasing energy and capacity needs. There can be no assurance that these energy and capacity needs will not change or that the resources will be adequate to meet load demands, in which case Idaho Power would need to rely on wholesale power purchases and would be subject to the volatility of wholesale markets. If the incremental costs associated with unanticipated changes in loads exceed the incremental revenue received from the sales to the new customers, and Idaho Power is unable to secure timely and full rate relief to recover those increased costs, the resulting imbalance could have an adverse effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.Changes in weather conditions, severe weather, and the impacts of climate change can affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's operating results and cause them to fluctuate seasonally. Idaho Power's electric power sales are seasonal, with demand in Idaho Power's service area peaking during the hot summer months, with a secondary peak during the cold winter months. Electric power demands by irrigation customers in Idaho Power's service area, which are impacted by temperatures and the timing and amount of precipitation, can also create significant seasonal changes in usage. Seasonality of revenues may be further impacted by Idaho Power's tiered rate structure, under which rates charged to customers are often higher during higher-load periods, such as hot summers and cold winters. Market prices for power also often increase significantly during these peak periods, at times when Idaho Power is required to purchase power in the wholesale markets to meet customer demand. While Idaho Power has regulatory mechanisms to help mitigate the impact of weather on power supply costs, there is no assurance that it will continue to receive such regulatory protection in the future. By contrast, when temperatures are relatively mild or where precipitation supplants irrigation systems, loads are often lower as customers are not using electricity for heating and air conditioning or irrigation purposes. Thus, weather conditions and the timing and extent of precipitation can cause IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition to fluctuate seasonally, quarterly, and from year to year. Climate change could also have significant physical effects in Idaho Power’s service area, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, lightning, high winds, icing events, droughts, heat waves, fires, floods, snow loading, and other extreme weather events. These extreme weather events and their associated impacts could damage transmission, distribution, and generation facilities, causing service interruptions and extended or mass outages, increasing costs, and limiting Idaho Power's ability to meet customer energy demand. Sustained drought conditions or decreased snow pack due to reduced precipitation or higher temperatures are likely to decrease power generation from hydropower plants. The costs of repairing and replacing infrastructure or any costs related to Idaho Power liability for personal injury, loss of life, and property damage from utility equipment that fails, including as a result of significant weather and weather-related events and the increasing threat of fires, may not be covered in full by insurance. Costs incurred in connection with such events might also not be recovered through customer rates if the costs incurred are greater than those allowed for recovery by regulators. Idaho Power's customers' energy needs vary with weather and to the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, customers' energy use could increase or decrease. Increased energy use due to weather changes may require Idaho Power to invest in generating assets and transmission and distribution infrastructure, while decreased energy use due to weather changes may result in decreased revenues. Extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand may raise wholesale electricity prices for power that Idaho Power purchases to serve customers, increasing the cost of energy Idaho Power provides to its customers, and at the same time can increase the revenues Idaho Power receives for wholesale market sales of excess generation during regional extreme weather events. Variations in hydropower generation that increase Idaho Power's reliance on market purchases may lead to more costly power supply sources for its customers and reduce benefits from selling surplus hydropower in the wholesale market. The price of power in the wholesale energy markets tends to be higher during periods of high regional demand that tends to occur with weather extremes, which may cause Idaho Power to purchase power in the wholesale market during peak price periods, increasing power supply costs. Idaho Power has in place mechanisms to help mitigate the effects of energy market price volatility, but there is no assurance these mechanisms will continue to be in place or function as intended.In addition, state and federal legislation and regulations have been proposed in recent years and may be implemented in the future, intended to limit the severity and impact of climate change. Proposals have included imposing mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which could increase Idaho Power’s power supply and compliance costs or require generation facilities to be retired early, resulting in potential stranded costs and write-downs or write-offs if Idaho Power is unable to fully recover investments in such facilities. If financial markets increasingly view climate change or GHG emissions as a financial or investment risk for electric utilities, it could negatively affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's ability to access debt and equity capital markets on favorable terms. For additional information relating to legislation, regulations, and legal proceedings related to environmental matters, see Part II - Item 7 - MD&A - ""Environmental Matters” in this report.25Table of Contents                                                 New advances in power generation, energy efficiency, alternative energy sources, or other technologies that impact the power utility industry could decrease customer energy demand and revenues, which could have implications for generation and system planning. Advances in technology and changes in customer demand and preferences in the electric utility industry have encouraged the development of new technologies for power generation, renewable energy, energy storage, customer-owned generation, and energy efficiency. In particular, in recent years the net cost of solar and wind generation and storage technology has decreased significantly, and there are federal and state regulations, laws, and other incentives in place to help further reduce the net cost of solar, wind, and energy storage facilities. There is potential that customer-owned solar power generation systems, could become sufficiently cost-effective and efficient that an increasing number of Idaho Power's customers choose to install such systems on their homes or businesses, which in turn could require changes in the way Idaho Power builds and manages its distribution systems and substantial grid infrastructure costs, and at the same time reduce the demand for and sale of energy. Additionally, considerable emphasis has been placed on energy efficiency, such as LED lighting and high-efficiency appliances. Energy efficiency programs, including programs sponsored by Idaho Power under a directive from state regulatory commissions, are designed to reduce energy use and demand. The introduction of new technologies could pose risks in the form of reduced sales and new business models for energy services. These changes in technology could also alter the channels through which customers buy or utilize energy, including the potential formation of community-based, cooperative ownership or municipal structures, which could reduce Idaho Power's revenues or impact Idaho Power's expenses. A reduction in load, however, would not necessarily reduce Idaho Power's need for ongoing investments in its infrastructure to reliably serve its customers. If Idaho Power is unable to adjust its rate design or maintain adequate regulatory mechanisms allowing for timely cost recovery, declining usage from customer-owned generation sources and energy efficiency could result in under-recovery of Idaho Power's costs and investment in infrastructure, and reduce revenues, which would impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Acts or threats of terrorism, acts of war, social unrest, cyber or physical security attacks, and other malicious acts of individuals or groups seeking to disrupt Idaho Power's operations or the electric power grid or compromise data could adversely impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's business, financial condition, and results of operations. Idaho Power operates in an industry that requires the continuous use and operation of sophisticated information technology and increasingly complex operational technology systems and network infrastructure. Idaho Power's generation and transmission facilities and its grid operations are potential targets for terrorist acts and threats, acts of war, social unrest, cyber and physical security attacks, and other disruptive activities of individuals or groups, including by nation states or nation state-sponsored groups. There have been cyber and physical attacks within the energy industry on energy infrastructure such as electric substations and fuel pipelines in the past with notable reports in the media of electric industry infrastructure specifically being targeted for and impacted by physical attacks more recently, and there are likely to be additional attacks in the future. Idaho Power and its vendors have been subject to, and will likely continue to be subject to, attempts to gain unauthorized access to systems and confidential information, or to disrupt operations. As noted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the utility industry is continuing to experience an increase in the frequency and sophistication of cybersecurity incidents. Some of Idaho Power's facilities are deemed ""critical infrastructure"" under federal standards, in that incapacity or destruction of the facilities could have a debilitating impact on security, reliability or operability of the bulk electric power system, national economic security, and public health and safety. The fact that infrastructure facilities, such as power generation facilities and electric transmission or distribution facilities, are direct targets of, or potential indirect casualties of, an act of terror or war or cyber or physical attack (whether originating internal to Idaho Power or externally), may affect Idaho Power's operations by limiting the ability to generate, purchase, or transmit power. Idaho Power's electric transmission systems are part of an interconnected regional grid, and therefore, it faces the risk of causing or being subject to a long-term power outage due to grid disturbances or disruptions on a neighboring interconnected grid system. Cyber and physical threats and attacks can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across networks, information systems, and other technologies. Network, information systems, and technology-related events, including those caused by IDACORP or Idaho Power through process breakdowns, human error, security architecture or design vulnerabilities, or by third parties through cyber or physical security attacks, could result in a degradation or disruption in the energy grid and the services of the companies, as well as the ability to record, process, and report customer, business, and financial information. Physical or cyber attacks against key suppliers or service providers could have a similar effect on Idaho Power.Idaho Power's business operations require the continuous availability of information technology systems and network infrastructure, and in the normal course of business, Idaho Power or its vendors collect and store sensitive and confidential customer and employee information and proprietary information of Idaho Power. Idaho Power’s technology systems are dependent upon connectivity to the internet and third-party vendors to host, maintain, modify, and update its systems, which may experience significant system failures or cyber attacks that could compromise the security of Idaho Power’s assets and information. All information technology systems are vulnerable to disability, unauthorized access, unintentional defects, user 26Table of Contents                                                 error, errors in system changes, and cybersecurity incidents. Idaho Power is in the process of pursuing complex business system upgrades, and these significant changes increase the risk of system interruption. Any data security breaches, such as misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in Idaho Power's information technology systems or on third-party systems, including customer or employee data, could result in violations of privacy and other laws and associated litigation and liability for damages, fines, and penalties; financial loss to Idaho Power or to its customers; customer dissatisfaction or diminished customer confidence; and damage to Idaho Power’s reputation, all of which could materially affect Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. No security measures can completely shield Idaho Power's systems, infrastructure, and data from vulnerabilities to cyber attacks, human error, intrusions, or other catastrophic events that could result in their failure or reduced functionality, and ultimately the potential loss of sensitive information or the loss of Idaho Power's ability to fulfill critical business functions and provide reliable electric power to customers. Despite the steps Idaho Power may take to detect, mitigate, or eliminate threats and respond to security incidents, the techniques used by those who seek to obtain unauthorized access, and possibly disable or sabotage systems or abscond with information and data, change frequently and Idaho Power may not be able to protect against all such actions. Idaho Power actively monitors developments in the area of cybersecurity and is involved in various related government and industry groups, and the company’s board receives security updates at least quarterly. Although Idaho Power continues to make investments in its cybersecurity program, including personnel, technologies, and training of personnel, there can be no assurance that these systems or their expected functionality will be implemented, maintained, or expanded effectively; nor can security measures completely eliminate the possibility of a cybersecurity breach. Further, the implementation of security guidelines and measures has resulted in, and Idaho Power expects to continue to result in, increased costs.  Terrorist attacks, acts of war, social unrest, cyber and physical security attacks, and similar incidents can also have indirect impacts by creating political, economic, social, or financial market instability, and can cause damage to or interference with Idaho Power’s operating assets, customers, or suppliers. This may result in business interruption, lost revenue, higher commodity prices, disruption in fuel supplies, lower energy consumption, and unstable commodity and financial markets, particularly with respect to electricity and natural gas, any of which may materially adversely affect Idaho Power. These events, and governmental actions in response, could result in a material decrease in revenues and increase costs to protect, repair, and insure Idaho Power's assets and operate its infrastructure, systems, and business.Changes in capital expenditures for infrastructure and the risks associated with permitting and construction of utility infrastructure can significantly affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power’s business is capital intensive and requires significant investments in power supply, transmission, and distribution infrastructure. A significant portion of Idaho Power’s facilities were constructed many years ago, and thus require periodic upgrades and frequent maintenance. Also, short-term and long-term anticipated increases in both the number of customers and the demand for energy require expansion and reinforcement of that infrastructure as described in Idaho Power's 2021 IRP. Idaho Power is not only in the permitting process for two high-voltage transmission line projects, but has also entered into contracts to purchase, own, and operate 180 megawatts of battery storage assets as well as issued a request for proposals for new resources, which are intended to help meet increasing customer energy demands. Idaho Power expects significant investment in capital improvements and expenditures for infrastructure projects that are subject to usual permitting and construction risks that can adversely affect project costs and the completion time. These risks include, as examples:•the ability to timely obtain labor or materials at reasonable costs;•defaults and delays by suppliers and contractors, including delays for specialty equipment that require significant lead times;•increases in price and limitations on availability of commodities, materials, and equipment; •imposition of tariffs on commodities, materials, and equipment sourced by foreign providers; •equipment, engineering, and design failures;•credit quality of counterparties and suppliers and their ability to meet financial and operational commitments; •unexpected environmental and geological problems;•the effects of adverse weather conditions; •catastrophic events, natural disasters, epidemics, pandemics and other public health or disruptive events that could result in supply chain disruptions, as well as permitting and construction delays;•availability of financing; •the ability to obtain approval from local, state, or federal regulatory and governmental bodies and to comply with permits and land use rights, and environmental constraints; and•delays and costs associated with disputes and litigation with third parties. 27Table of Contents                                                 The occurrence of any of these risks could cause Idaho Power to operate at reduced capacity levels, which in turn could reduce revenues and reliability, increase expenses, or cause Idaho Power to incur penalties. If Idaho Power is unable to complete the permitting or construction of a project, or incurs costs that regulators do not deem prudent, it may be unable to recover its costs in full through rates or on a timely basis. Further, if Idaho Power is unable to secure permits or joint funding commitments to develop transmission infrastructure necessary to serve loads or if other resources become more economical, it may terminate those projects and, as alternatives, seek to develop additional generation facilities within areas where Idaho Power has available transmission capacity or pursue other more costly options to serve loads. To limit the timing-related risks of these projects, Idaho Power may enter into purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals or permits. If any of the projects are canceled for any reason, including Idaho Power's failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals or permits or because the project is no longer economical, Idaho Power could incur significant cancellation penalties under purchase orders or construction contracts. Additionally, termination of a project carries with it the potential for impairment of the associated asset if regulators deny full recovery of project costs. Thus, termination of a project could negatively affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.Demand for power could exceed forecasted supply, resulting in deliverability risks and increased costs for purchasing capacity in the market or acquiring or constructing additional generation resources and battery storage facilities. Idaho Power's 2021 IRP identified a low-cost preferred resource portfolio and action plan for the next 20-year period that includes adding substantial renewable resources and ending participation in the remaining coal-fired units by the end of 2028. As Idaho Power implements the IRP's action plan, which also advances its goal to provide 100 percent clean energy by 2045, it remains obligated to provide reliable and affordable energy to its customers, but there are certain potential deliverability and cost risks associated with this transition. These risks include, but are not limited to, (1) the failure to timely obtain or construct additional resources to meet forecast needs related to load growth and coal exits, (2) increased renewable energy generation presenting risks of uncertainty and variability that could be further compounded as neighboring systems transition towards increasing levels of renewable resources, and (3) increased potential resource volatility due to changes in the energy market. During peak periods, power demand could exceed Idaho Power’s forecasted available generation capacity, particularly if Idaho Power’s power plants are not performing as anticipated and additional resources and battery storage are not acquired as needed to meet demand. Competitive market forces or adverse regulatory actions may require Idaho Power to purchase capacity and energy from the market, if such resources are even available for purchase, or build additional resources to meet customers’ energy needs in an expedited manner. If that occurs, Idaho Power may be unable to recover these additional costs and could experience a lag between when costs are incurred and when regulators permit recovery in customers’ rates, which could have negative impacts on operations and cash flows. Factors contributing to lower hydropower generation can increase costs and negatively impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power derives a significant portion of its power supply from its hydropower facilities. During both 2022 and 2021, 48 percent of Idaho Power's electric power from Idaho Power-owned generation was from hydropower facilities. Due to Idaho Power’s heavy reliance on hydropower generation, the impacts of climate change and factors such as precipitation and snowpack, the timing of run-off, and the availability of water in the Snake River Basin can significantly affect its operations. The combination of a long-term trend of declining Snake River base flows, over-appropriation of water, and periods of drought have led to water rights disputes and proceedings among surface water and ground water irrigators and the State of Idaho. Recharging the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer by diverting surface water to porous locations and permitting it to sink into the aquifer is one approach to the over-appropriation dispute. Diversions from the Snake River for aquifer recharge or the loss of water rights reduce Snake River flows available for hydropower generation. When hydropower generation is reduced, Idaho Power must increase its use of more expensive thermal generating resources and market power purchases; therefore, costs increase and opportunities for wholesale energy sales are reduced, reducing revenues and potentially earnings. Through its power cost adjustment mechanisms, Idaho Power expects to recover most (but not all) of the increase in net power supply costs caused by lower hydropower generation. The timing of recovery of the increased costs, however, may not occur until the subsequent power cost adjustment year, adversely affecting cash flows and liquidity.Idaho Power’s use of coal and natural gas to fuel power generation facilities exposes it to commodity availability and price risk, which can adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition. As part of its normal business operations, Idaho Power purchases coal and natural gas in the open market or under short-term or long-term contracts, often with variable pricing terms. Market prices for coal and natural gas are volatile and influenced by factors impacting supply and demand such as weather conditions, the adequacy and type of generating capacity, fuel transportation availability, economic conditions, regulations related to GHG emissions, changes in technology, moratoriums on federally leased coal, and increases in coal lease costs. Natural gas transportation to Idaho Power's three natural gas plants is limited to one primary pipeline, presenting a heightened possibility of supply constraint and disruptions separate from the risk of 28Table of Contents                                                 counterparty default. Idaho Power's current coal supply arrangements are under long-term contracts for coal originating in Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado, and thus Idaho Power is exposed to risk of disruption of coal production in, or transportation from, those regions. Idaho Power may from time to time enter into new, or renegotiate, these contracts but can provide no assurance that such contracts will be negotiated or renegotiated on satisfactory terms, or at all. There also can be no assurance that counterparties to the natural gas or coal supply agreements will fulfill their obligations to supply natural gas or coal, and they may experience regulatory, financial, or technical problems or unforeseeable events that inhibit their ability to deliver natural gas or coal. Disruptions in transportation of fuel and defaults by coal and natural gas suppliers may cause Idaho Power to seek alternative, and potentially more costly, sources of fuel or rely on other generation sources or wholesale market power purchases. Idaho Power's failure to provide service due to such disruptions may also result in fines, penalties, or cost disallowances through the regulatory process. Idaho Power may not be able to fully or timely recover these increased costs through rates and power cost adjustment mechanisms, which may adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power’s power supply, transmission, and distribution facilities are subject to numerous operational risks unique to it and its industry, including circumstances causing power outages, injuries and property damage, loss of life, and fires. Operating risks associated with Idaho Power's power supply, transmission, and distribution facilities include equipment failures, volatility in fuel and transportation pricing, interruptions in fuel supplies, increased regulatory compliance costs, changes necessitated by environmental legislation or litigation, labor disputes or attrition, accidents and workforce safety matters, environmental damage, property damage, wildfires, acts of terrorism or war or sabotage (both cyber and asset-based), the loss of cost-effective disposal options for solid waste such as coal ash, operator error, and the occurrence of catastrophic events at the facilities. Diminished availability or performance of those facilities could result in reduced customer satisfaction, reputational harm, liability to third parties (including tort liability), and regulatory inquiries and fines. Operation of Idaho Power's owned and co-owned generating stations below expected capacity levels, or unplanned outages at these stations, could cause reduced energy output and lower efficiency levels and result in lost revenues and increased expenses for alternative fuels or wholesale market power purchases. Further, during high-load periods the transmission system in Idaho Power's service area is constrained, limiting the ability to transmit electric energy within the service area and access electric energy from outside the service area. Idaho Power's transmission facilities are also interconnected with those of third parties, and thus operation of Idaho Power's and third-parties' facilities could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events. These transmission constraints and events could result in failure to provide reliable service to customers and the inability to deliver energy from generating facilities to the power grid, and the inability to access lower cost sources of electric energy. Idaho Power also enters into agreements with third-party contractors to perform work on its power supply, transmission, and distribution facilities, and may in some circumstances retain liability for the quality and completion of those contractors’ work, potentially subjecting Idaho Power to penalties, liability for personal injury, loss of life, or property damage, reputational harm, or enforcement actions or liability if a contractor violates applicable laws, rules, regulations, or orders.Accidents, acts of terrorism or war, electrical contacts, fires, explosions, catastrophic failures, general system damage or dysfunction, intentional acts of destruction, uncontrolled release of water from hydropower dams, and other unplanned events related to Idaho Power's infrastructure would increase repair costs and may expose Idaho Power to liability for personal injury, loss of life, and property damage. Fires alleged to have been caused by Idaho Power's transmission, distribution, or generation infrastructure, or that allegedly result from Idaho Power’s or its contractors’ operating or maintenance practices, could also expose Idaho Power to claims for fire suppression and clean-up costs, evacuation costs, fines and penalties, and liability for economic damages, personal injury, loss of life, property damage, and environmental pollution, whether based on claims of negligence, trespass, or otherwise. The risk of wildfires is exacerbated in forested areas where beetle infestations and rising tree mortality rates have caused a significant increase in the quantity of standing dead and dying timber, increasing the risk that such trees may fall from either inside or outside our right-of-way into a powerline igniting a fire and increasing the magnitude of fires. A significant number of urban-wildland interfaces in and near Idaho Power's service area, and commonly hot, dry summer conditions that may worsen as a result of climate change, increase the likelihood and magnitude of damages that may be caused by fires burning into or allegedly originating from utility equipment. Further, there has been an increasing trend in the degree of annual destruction from wildfires in the western United States. Idaho Power maintains insurance coverage for such operating and event risks, but insurance coverage is subject to the terms and limitations of the available policies and may not be sufficient in amount to cover Idaho Power’s ultimate liability. Coverage limits within wildfire insurance policies could result in material self-insured costs in the event there are fires that are deemed to be separate occurrences covered by self-insured retention amounts under the terms of Idaho Power’s insurance policies. Idaho Power or its contractors and customers could also experience coverage reductions and increased wildfire insurance costs in future years. Idaho Power may be unable to fully recover costs in excess of insurance through customer rates or regulatory mechanisms and, even if such recovery is possible, it could take several years to collect. If the amount of insurance is insufficient or otherwise unavailable, and if Idaho Power is unable to fully recover in rates the costs of uninsured losses, IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially affected.29Table of Contents                                                 Purchases of power from renewable energy projects, and integration of power generated from those projects into Idaho Power's system, may increase costs and decrease system reliability, and adversely affect Idaho Power's and IDACORP's results of operations and financial condition. An abundance of intermittent, non-dispatchable generation from renewable energy projects interconnected with Idaho Power's system has had an impact on the operation of Idaho Power's generation plants, system reliability, power supply costs, and the wholesale power markets. Idaho Power is generally obligated under federal law to purchase power from certain renewable energy projects, regardless of the then-current load demand, availability of lower cost generation resources, or wholesale energy market prices. As of December 31, 2022, Idaho Power had federally-mandated contracts to purchase energy from 129 on-line projects with third parties. This increases the likelihood and frequency that Idaho Power will be required to reduce output from its lower-cost hydropower and fossil fuel-fired generation resources, which in turn increases power purchase costs and customer rates and impacts Idaho Power's ability to invest in additional generation and earn a reasonable return on rate base in the future. Further, balancing load and generation from Idaho Power's power generation portfolio is challenging, and Idaho Power expects that its operational and infrastructure costs will continue to increase as a result of its efforts to integrate intermittent, non-dispatchable generation from a large number of renewable energy projects. If Idaho Power is unable to timely recover those costs through its rates, power cost adjustment mechanisms, or otherwise, those increased costs may negatively affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's activities are concentrated in one industry and in one region, which exposes it to risks from lack of diversification, regional economic conditions, and regional legislation and regulation. IDACORP and Idaho Power do not have diversified operations or sources of revenue. Idaho Power comprises the bulk of IDACORP's operations, and Idaho Power's business is concentrated solely in the electric power industry. Furthermore, Idaho Power's provision of electric service to retail customers is conducted exclusively in its southern Idaho and eastern Oregon service area. As a result, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's future performance, revenues, and collectability of revenues, as well as expenses, will be affected by regional economic conditions, regulatory and legislative activity, weather conditions, and other events and conditions in its service area and in the electric power industry.  The impacts of a retiring workforce with specialized utility-specific functions and the inability to hire qualified third-party vendors could increase costs and adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power’s operations require a skilled workforce to perform specialized utility functions. Many of these positions, such as linemen, grid operators, engineering and design personnel, and generation plant operators, require extensive, specialized training. Idaho Power does not have employment contracts with its officers or key employees and cannot guarantee that any member of its management or any key employee at the IDACORP parent or any subsidiary level will continue to serve in any capacity for any particular period of time. Employee retention and recruitment may also be negatively impacted by more flexible remote work opportunities, higher pay offered by other employers, or lower cost of living in other areas. The loss of skills and institutional knowledge of experienced employees, the failure to foster an innovative, inclusive, equitable, and diverse environment in order to hire appropriately qualified employees, the costs associated with attracting, training, and retaining such employees to replace an aging and skilled workforce or the inability to do so, and the operational and financial costs of unionization or the attempt to unionize all or part of the companies’ workforce, could have a negative effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power could incur increased costs due to such turnover due to a loss of knowledge, errors due to inexperienced employees or substantial training time, loss of productivity, and increased safety compliance issues.Idaho Power also hires third-party vendors to assist in performing a variety of ordinary business functions, such as power plant maintenance, data warehousing and management, software development and licensing, electric transmission and distribution operations, billing and metering processes, and vegetation management, among other things. In recent years, Idaho Power has experienced increased competition and rising prices for many forms of third-party vendor services. While Idaho Power does not rely entirely on third-party vendors for many of these business functions, the unavailability of such vendors could adversely affect the quality and cost of Idaho Power's electric service and negatively impact its results of operation.Legal and Compliance RisksLegal and compliance risk relates to risks arising from government and regulatory action and from legal proceedings and compliance with applicable laws, rules, orders, regulations, policies, and procedures, including those related to financial reporting, environmental, health, and safety, and potential changes in legal requirements.Changes in legislation, regulation, and government policy may have a material adverse effect on IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s business in the future. Specific legislative and regulatory proposals and recently enacted legislation that could have a 30Table of Contents                                                 material impact on IDACORP and Idaho Power include, but are not limited to, tax reform, utility regulation, carbon-reduction initiatives, infrastructure renewal programs, climate change and environmental regulation, and modifications to accounting and public company reporting requirements. Further, the proposals and new legislation could have an impact on the rate of growth of Idaho Power’s customers and their willingness to expand operations and increase electric service requirements. Under the current Presidential Administration, Idaho Power expects laws, regulations, and policies relating to environmental compliance to continue to change and require IDACORP and Idaho Power and some of their customers to modify their business strategy or restrict activities and projects, potentially subjecting them to increased compliance costs. For example, in January 2021, the United States rejoined the Paris Agreement on climate change that requires commitments related to GHG emissions, among other things, and the Presidential Administration has announced ambitious clean energy initiatives. Many states and localities may continue to pursue climate policies in addition to federal mandates. The state of Oregon, for instance, has been pursuing cap-and-trade legislation for GHG emissions. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if such non-compliance is caused by factors outside of Idaho Power's control, may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties or fines, or government enforcement actions. Idaho Power could also become subject to climate change lawsuits and an adverse outcome could require substantial expenditures and could possibly require payment of damages. IDACORP and Idaho Power expect federal, state, and local governmental authorities to implement various recent and expected future executive orders from the Presidential Administration and are unable to predict whether and to what extent such actions will meaningfully change existing legislative and regulatory environments relevant to the companies, or if any such changes would have a net positive or negative impact on the companies. Idaho Power is unable to estimate the costs of complying with such legislative or regulatory changes due to the uncertainties associated with the nature and implementation of the changes, and may not be able to recover the associated costs. To the extent that such changes have a negative impact on the companies or Idaho Power’s customers, including as a result of related uncertainty, these changes may materially and adversely impact IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.Changes in income tax laws and regulations, or differing interpretation or enforcement of applicable laws by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdictions, could have a material adverse impact on IDACORP’s or Idaho Power’s financial condition and results of operations. IDACORP and Idaho Power must make judgments and interpretations about the application of the law when determining the provision for income taxes. Amounts of income tax-related assets and liabilities involve judgments and estimates of the timing and probability of recognition of income, deductions, and tax credits, which are subject to challenge by taxing authorities. These judgments may include estimates for potential outcomes regarding tax positions that may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities. Disputes over interpretations of tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority in examination, upon appeal, or through litigation. In recent years, state regulatory mechanisms with income tax-related provisions (such as Idaho Power's May 2018 Idaho tax reform settlement stipulation approved by the IPUC), have significantly impacted IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations. The outcome of potential future income tax proceedings or laws, or the state public utility commissions' treatment of those outcomes, could differ materially from the amounts IDACORP and Idaho Power record prior to conclusion of those proceedings, and the difference could negatively affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s earnings and cash flows. Further, in some instances, the treatment from a ratemaking perspective of any net income tax expense (including from increased tax rates) or benefit could be different than IDACORP or Idaho Power anticipate or request from applicable state regulatory commissions, which could have a negative effect on their financial condition and results of operations. In addition, Idaho Power uses the regulatory flow-through income tax accounting method as described in Note 1 - ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report, and potential changes in income tax laws or interpretations may impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's income taxes and reporting obligations differently than most other companies.IDACORP's and Idaho Power’s businesses are subject to an extensive set of environmental laws, rules, and regulations, which could impact their operations and costs of operations, potentially rendering some generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate, and could increase the costs and alter the timing of major projects. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's operations are subject to a number of federal, state, and local environmental statutes, rules, and regulations relating to climate change, air and water quality, natural resources, endangered species and wildlife, renewable energy, and health and safety. Many of these laws and regulations are described in Part II - Item 7 - MD&A - ""Environmental Matters” in this report. These laws and regulations generally require IDACORP and Idaho Power to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, and other approvals, including through substantial investment in pollution controls, and may be enforced by both public officials and private individuals. Some of these regulations are pending, changing, or subject to interpretation, and failure to comply may result in penalties, mandatory operational changes, and other adverse consequences, including costs associated with defending against claims by governmental authorities or private parties and complying with new operating requirements. Idaho Power devotes significant resources to environmental monitoring, pollution control equipment, and mitigation projects to comply with existing and anticipated environmental regulations. However, it is possible that federal, state and local authorities could attempt to enforce more stringent standards, stricter regulation, and more expansive application of environmental regulations. 31Table of Contents                                                 Environmental regulations have created the need for Idaho Power to install new pollution control equipment at, and may cause Idaho Power to perform environmental remediation on, its owned and co-owned power generation facilities, often at a substantial cost. Compliance with environmental regulations can significantly increase capital spending, operating costs, and plant outages, and can negatively affect the affordability of Idaho Power's services for customers. Idaho Power cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures necessary to comply with these environmental laws and regulations, although Idaho Power expects the expenditures could be substantial. In some cases, the costs to obtain permits and ensure facilities are in compliance may be prohibitively expensive. If the costs of compliance with new regulations renders the generating facilities uneconomical to maintain or operate, Idaho Power would need to identify alternative resources for power, potentially in the form of new generation and transmission facilities, market power purchases, demand-side management programs, or a combination of these and other methods. Furthermore, Idaho Power may not be able to obtain or maintain all environmental regulatory approvals necessary for operation of its existing infrastructure or construction of new infrastructure. In addition, some environmental regulations are currently subject to litigation and not yet final. As a result of this uncertainty, approaches to comply with the regulations, including available control technologies or other allowed compliance measures, are unpredictable and Idaho Power cannot foresee the potential impacts these regulations would have on Idaho Power's operations or financial condition. In 2019, Idaho Power announced its long-term goal to serve customers with 100 percent clean energy by 2045, and Idaho Power has short-term and medium-term goals for CO2 emission reductions, which could impact infrastructure resource decisions and costs. Idaho Power's ability to achieve these targets are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the company's regulatory obligation to serve its customers, the availability and cost of new generation resources, legal and permitting requirements, system operation and energy integration, grid balancing, among others. Additionally, Idaho Power is not guaranteed timely or full recovery through customer rates of costs associated with environmental regulations, environmental compliance, its clean energy initiatives, plant closures, or clean-up of contamination. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if Idaho Power fails to obtain, maintain, or comply with any such approval, construction and/or operation of Idaho Power's generation or transmission facilities could be delayed, halted, terminated, or subjected to additional costs. For further discussion of environmental matters that may affect Idaho Power, see ""Environmental Matters"" in Item 7 - MD&A in this report.Obligations imposed in connection with hydropower license renewals and permitting may require large capital expenditures, increase operating costs, reduce hydropower generation, and negatively affect IDACORP's or Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition. For the last several years, Idaho Power has been engaged in an effort to renew its federal license for its largest hydropower generation source, the Hells Canyon Complex (HCC). Relicensing and ongoing permitting requirements include an extensive public review process that involves numerous natural resource issues and environmental conditions. The existence of endangered and threatened species in the watershed may result in major operational changes to the region’s hydropower projects, which may be reflected in hydropower licenses, including for the HCC and the American Falls facility. In addition, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to hydropower facilities, which could further increase required expenditures for marine life recovery and endangered species protection and reduce the amount of hydropower generation available to meet Idaho Power’s generation requirements. Idaho Power cannot predict the requirements that might be imposed during the relicensing and permitting process, the financial impact of those requirements, whether a new multi-year license will ultimately be issued, and whether the IPUC or OPUC will allow recovery through rates of the substantial costs incurred in connection with the licensing process and subsequent compliance. Imposition of onerous conditions in the relicensing and permitting processes could result in Idaho Power incurring significant capital expenditures, increase operating costs (including power purchase costs), and reduce hydropower generation, which could negatively affect results of operations and financial condition.Idaho Power could be subject to penalties, reputational harm, and operational changes if it violates mandatory reliability and security requirements, which could adversely impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition. As an owner and operator of a bulk power transmission system, Idaho Power is subject to mandatory reliability and security standards issued by the FERC and other regulators. The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability, security, and market interface principles. Compliance with reliability standards subjects Idaho Power to higher operating costs and increased capital expenditures. Idaho Power has received in recent years notices of violations from, and regularly self-reports reliability standard compliance issues to, the FERC, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and the Western Electricity Coordinating Council. Potential monetary and non-monetary penalties for a violation of FERC regulations may be substantial, and in some circumstances monetary penalties may exceed $1.4 million per day per violation. As a utility with a large customer base, Idaho Power is subject to adverse publicity focused on the reliability of its services and the speed with which it is able to respond to electric outages caused by storm damage or other unanticipated events. Adverse publicity could harm the reputations of IDACORP and Idaho Power; may make state legislatures, utility commissions, and other regulatory authorities less likely to view the 32Table of Contents                                                 companies in a favorable light; and may cause Idaho Power to be subject to less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes or increased regulatory oversight. The imposition of any of the foregoing on Idaho Power for its actual or alleged failure to comply with reliability and security requirements could also have a negative effect on its and IDACORP’s results of operations and financial condition.IDACORP and Idaho Power are subject to costs and other effects of legal and regulatory proceedings, disputes, and claims. From time to time in the normal course of business, IDACORP and Idaho Power are subject to various lawsuits, regulatory proceedings, disputes, and claims that could result in adverse judgments or settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, or other adverse consequences. These matters are subject to a number of uncertainties, and management is often unable to predict the outcome of such matters; resulting liabilities could exceed amounts currently reserved or insured against with respect to such matter. The legal costs and final resolution of matters in which IDACORP or Idaho Power are involved could have reputational impact and a short- or long-term negative effect on their financial condition and results of operations. Addressing any adverse publicity or governmental scrutiny could be time consuming and expensive, regardless of the basis of the assertions being made, and could impact Idaho Power's relationship with employees, stakeholders, and regulators. Further, the terms of resolution could require the companies to change their operational practices and procedures, which could also have a negative effect on their financial positions and results of operations.Changes in accounting standards or rules may impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial results and disclosures. The Financial Accounting Standards Board and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have made and may continue to make changes to accounting standards that impact presentation and disclosures of financial condition and results of operations. Further, new accounting orders issued by the FERC could significantly impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's reported financial condition. IDACORP and Idaho Power do not have any control over the impact these changes may have on their financial conditions or results of operations nor the timing of such changes. Idaho Power meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in its financial statements and to defer certain costs as regulatory assets until those costs are collected in rates, and to defer some items as regulatory liabilities. If recovery of these amounts ceases to be probable, if Idaho Power determines that it no longer meets the criteria for applying regulatory accounting or if accounting rules change to no longer provide for regulatory assets and liabilities, Idaho Power could be required to eliminate some or all of those regulatory assets or liabilities. Any of these circumstances could result in write-offs and have a material effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power’s financial condition and results of operations. Financial and Investment RisksFinancial and investment risks relate to IDACORP's and Idaho Power's ability to meet financial obligations and mitigate exposure to market risks, including liquidity risks and the ability to raise capital and cost of funding, risks related to credit ratings, credit risk, liquidity, interest rates, and commodity prices. Volatility or disruptions in the financial markets, failure of IDACORP or Idaho Power to satisfy conditions necessary for obtaining loans or issuing debt securities, and denial of regulatory authority to issue debt or equity securities, may negatively affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s ability to access capital and/or increase their cost of borrowing and ability to execute on their strategic plans. IDACORP and Idaho Power use credit facilities, commercial paper markets, and long-term debt as significant sources of liquidity and funding for operating and capital requirements and debt maturities not satisfied by operating cash flow. Credit facilities represent commitments by the participating banks to make loans and issue letters of credit. However, the ability and obligation of the participating banks to make those loans and issue letters of credit is subject to specified conditions and volatility or disruptions in the financial markets could affect the companies' ability to obtain debt financing or draw upon or renew existing credit facilities on favorable terms and comply with debt covenants. Idaho Power's ability to issue long-term debt is also subject to a number of conditions included in an indenture, and Idaho Power's ability to issue long-term debt and commercial paper is subject to the availability of purchasers willing to purchase the securities under reasonable terms or at all. Because of these limitations, IDACORP and Idaho Power may be unable to issue commercial paper or short-term or long-term debt at reasonable interest rates and terms or at all. Higher interest rates on short-term borrowings with variable interest rates could also have an adverse effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's operating results. Changes in interest rates may also impact the fair value of the debt securities in Idaho Power's pension funds, as well as Idaho Power's ability to earn a return on short-term investments of excess cash. Also, while the credit facilities represent a contractual obligation to make loans, one or more of the participating banks may default on their obligations to make loans under, or may withdraw from, the credit facilities. Idaho Power is required to obtain regulatory approval in Idaho, Oregon, and Wyoming in order to borrow money or to issue securities and is therefore dependent on the public utility commissions of those states to issue favorable orders in a timely 33Table of Contents                                                 manner to permit them to finance their operations, capital expenditures, and debt maturities. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's credit facilities consist of revolving lines of credit not to exceed an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of $100 million and $300 million, respectively (Credit Facilities). The Credit Facilities include financial covenants that limit the amount of debt that can be outstanding as a percentage of total capital, and Idaho Power's long-term debt has also been issued under an indenture that contains a number of financial covenants. The companies must also make specified representations in connection with requests for loans and it is possible that they may be unable to do so at the time of such request, which would limit or eliminate the obligation of the banks to provide loans. Failure to maintain these representations and covenants could preclude IDACORP and Idaho Power from issuing commercial paper, borrowing under their Credit Facilities, or issuing long-term debt, and could trigger a default and repayment obligation under debt instruments, which could limit their ability to pursue certain projects, acquisitions, or improvements, to support future growth, and adversely impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. A downgrade in IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s credit ratings could affect the companies’ ability to access capital, increase their cost of borrowing, and require the companies to post collateral with transaction counterparties. Credit rating agencies periodically review the corporate credit ratings and long-term ratings of IDACORP and Idaho Power. These ratings are premised on financial ratios and performance, the regulatory environment and rate mechanisms, the effectiveness of management, resource risks and power supply costs, and other factors. IDACORP and Idaho Power also have borrowing arrangements that rely on the ability of the banks to fund loans or support commercial paper, a principal source of short-term financing. In addition, IDACORP's or Idaho Power's credit ratings may change as a result of the differing methodologies or change in the methodologies used by the various rating agencies. Downgrades of IDACORP’s or Idaho Power’s credit ratings, or those affecting relationship banks, could limit the companies’ ability to access short- and long-term capital under reasonable terms or at all, reduce the pool of potential lenders, increase borrowing costs under existing Credit Facilities, limit access to the commercial paper market, require the companies to pay a higher interest rate on their debt, limit the ability of IDACORP to declare and make dividends, and require the companies to post additional performance assurance collateral with transaction counterparties. If access to capital were to become significantly constrained or costs of capital increased significantly due to lowered credit ratings, prevailing industry conditions, regulatory constraints, the volatility of the capital markets or other factors, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions (including generating capacity and transmission assets, which may be necessary for future growth), liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.Stakeholder actions and increased regulatory activity related to ESG matters, particularly global climate change and reducing GHG emissions, could negatively impact IDACORP and Idaho Power. The power and gas utility industry is facing increasing stakeholder scrutiny related to ESG matters. Recently, Idaho Power has seen a rise in certain stakeholders, such as investors, customers, employees, and lenders, placing increasing importance on the impact and social cost associated with climate change. GHG emissions, including, most significantly CO2, could be further restricted in the future in response to additional state and federal regulatory requirements, increased scrutiny, and changing stakeholder expectations with respect to environmental and climate change programs, judicial decisions, and international accords. If new emissions reduction rules were to become effective, they could result in significant additional compliance costs that could negatively impact Idaho Power's future financial position, results of operations, and cash flows if such costs are not timely recovered through regulated rates. Moreover, the possibility exists that stricter laws, regulations, or enforcement policies could significantly increase compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary. In addition, the increasing focus on climate change and stricter regulatory and legal requirements may result in Idaho Power facing adverse reputational risks associated with certain of its operations producing GHG emissions. If Idaho Power is unable to satisfy the increasing climate-related expectations of certain stakeholders, IDACORP and Idaho Power may suffer reputational harm, which could cause IDACORP’s stock price to decrease or cause certain investors and financial institutions not to purchase the companies’ debt securities or otherwise provide the companies with capital or credit on favorable terms, which may cause IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s cost of capital to increase.Idaho Power’s energy risk management policy and programs relating to economically hedging commodity exposures and credit risk may not always perform as intended, and as a result, IDACORP and Idaho Power may suffer losses. Idaho Power enters into transactions to buy and sell power, natural gas, and transmission service, enters into transactions to hedge its positions in coal, natural gas, power, and other commodities, and enters into economic hedge transactions to mitigate in part exposure to variable commodity prices. IDACORP and Idaho Power could recognize losses as a result of volatility in the market value of these contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform. The derivative instruments used for hedging might not offset the underlying exposure being mitigated as intended, due to pricing inefficiencies or other terms of the derivative instruments, and any such failure to mitigate exposure could result in losses. Certain of Idaho Power's purchase or sale, hedging, and derivative agreements may result in the receipt of, or posting of, collateral with counterparties. Fluctuations in commodity prices that lead to the posting of collateral with counterparties negatively impact liquidity, and downgrades in Idaho 34Table of Contents                                                 Power's credit ratings may lead to additional collateral posting requirements. In 2022, Idaho Power recorded gains on economic hedges of $68.5 million, compared with $12.1 million of gains in 2021. The change in the magnitude of the gain is reflective of an increased volume of transactions, as well as high volatility in prices. At times, Idaho Power’s energy risk management policy results in Idaho Power entering into economic hedges in an environment where prices are high, and if prices are lower at the time the economic hedge settles, Idaho Power will record losses on the economic hedges. Depending on the volume of economic hedges and the degree of price volatility, those losses can be substantial, and the power cost adjustment mechanisms generally provide that Idaho Power will incur a portion of those losses. Forecasts of future fuel needs and loads and available resources to meet those loads are inherently uncertain and may cause Idaho Power to over- or under-hedge actual resource needs, exposing the company to market risk on the over- or under-hedged position. To the extent that commodity markets are illiquid, Idaho Power may not be able to execute its risk management strategies, which could result in undesired over-exposure to unhedged positions that Idaho Power may not be able to collect in customer rates. The FERC may take action to limit volatility in the energy market by imposing price limits or other market restrictions to control market-based rate sales, which could adversely affect the companies' financial results. As a result, risk management actions, or the failure or inability to manage commodity availability and price and counterparty risk, may adversely affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power has additional indirect credit exposures to financial institutions in the form of letters of credit provided as security by power suppliers under various purchased power contracts and by vendors for infrastructure development projects. If any of the credit ratings of the letter of credit issuers were to drop below investment grade, the vendor or supplier would need to replace the security with an acceptable substitute, which may be impracticable and may expose Idaho Power to losses resulting from a vendor or supplier default. If the security were not replaced, the party could be in default under the contract and Idaho Power's remedies for default may be inadequate to fully compensate Idaho Power for its losses. Further, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a counterparty to commodity or other transactions could impair Idaho Power’s ability to collect amounts receivable from those counterparties, potentially including the ability to collect or retain collateral posted by a counterparty. Idaho Power is a participant in the energy markets, including the energy imbalance market in the western United States (Western EIM), and engages in direct and indirect power purchase and sale transactions in connection with that participation. The Western EIM has collateral posting requirements based on established credit criteria, but there is no assurance the collateral will be sufficient to cover obligations that counterparties may owe each other in the Western EIM and any such credit losses could be socialized to all Western EIM participants, including Idaho Power. A significant failure of a participant in the Western EIM to make payments when due on its obligations could have a ripple effect on various Idaho Power counterparties in the power, gas, and derivative markets if those counterparties experience ancillary liquidity issues, and could generally result in a decline in the ability of Idaho Power’s counterparties to perform on their obligations. The performance of pension and postretirement benefit plan investments, increasing health care costs, and other factors impacting plan costs and funding obligations could adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations - primarily cash flows and liquidity. Idaho Power provides a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering most employees, as well as a defined benefit postretirement benefit plan (consisting of health care and death benefits) that covers eligible retirees. Costs of providing these benefits are based in part on the value of the plans' assets and, therefore, adverse investment performance for these assets or the failure to maintain sustained growth in pension investments over time could increase Idaho Power’s plan costs and funding requirements related to the plans. Idaho Power's self-insured costs of health care benefits for eligible employees and retirees have increased in recent years and Idaho Power believes that future legislative changes related to the provision of health care benefits and other external market conditions and factors, could cause such costs to continue to rise. As benefit costs continue to rise, there is no assurance that the IPUC and OPUC will continue to allow recovery. The key actuarial assumptions that affect pension funding obligations are the expected long-term return on plan assets and the discount rate used in determining future benefit obligations. Idaho Power evaluates the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis, taking into account changes in market conditions, trends, and future expectations. Estimates of future investment market performance, changes in interest rates, and other factors Idaho Power and its actuary firms use to develop the actuarial assumptions are inherently uncertain, and actual results could vary significantly from the estimates. Changes in demographics, including timing of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase Idaho Power's plan costs and funding requirements. Future pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments are also subject to the impacts of changes in legislation. Depending on the timing of contributions to the plans and Idaho Power's ability to recover costs through rates, cash contributions to the plans could reduce the cash available for the companies' businesses and payment of dividends. For additional information regarding Idaho Power's funding obligations under its benefit plans, see Note 11 - ""Benefit Plans"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. 35Table of Contents                                                 If the assumptions underlying coal mine reclamation at Bridger Coal Company and related forecast trust fund growth are materially inaccurate, Idaho Power’s costs could be greater than anticipated or be incurred sooner than anticipated. Bridger Coal Company (BCC), a subsidiary of Idaho Power located in the state of Wyoming, uses surface mining to extract coal to be used for power generation at the Jim Bridger power plant. The federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act and state laws and regulations establish operational, reclamation, bonding, and closure obligations and standards for mining of coal. BCC’s estimate of reclamation liability and bonding obligations is reviewed periodically by Idaho Power’s management committee, audit committee of the board of directors, external and internal auditors, and by government regulators. Idaho Power funds a trust and posts collateral in the form of a surety bond purchased jointly with the co-owner of BCC to cover such projected mine reclamation costs pursuant to the laws of the state of Wyoming. The trust funds are invested in debt and equity securities and poor performance of these investments would reduce the amount of funds available for their intended purpose, which could require Idaho Power to make additional cash contributions. If actual costs related to those obligations exceed estimates, government regulations relating to those obligations change significantly or unexpected cash funding obligations are required, IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.As a holding company, IDACORP does not have its own operating income and must rely on the cash flows from its subsidiaries to pay dividends and make debt payments. IDACORP is a holding company with no significant operations of its own, and its primary assets are shares or other ownership interests of its subsidiaries, primarily Idaho Power. IDACORP’s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts to IDACORP, whether through dividends, loans, or other means. The ability of IDACORP’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to IDACORP depends on several factors, including each subsidiary's actual and projected earnings and cash flow, capital requirements and general financial condition, regulatory restrictions, tax obligations, covenants contained in credit facilities to which they are parties, and the prior rights of holders of their existing and future first mortgage bonds and other debt or equity securities. Further, the amount and payment of dividends is at the discretion of the board of directors, which may reduce or cease payment of dividends at any time. See Note 6 - ""Common Stock"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a further description of restrictions on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's payment of dividends"
9,IDA,IDACORP INC,2022-02-17,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS IDACORP and Idaho Power operate in a highly regulated industry and business environment that involves significant risks, many of which are beyond the companies' control. The circumstances and factors set forth below should not be considered a complete list of potential risks that the companies may encounter. These risk factors, as well as additional risks and uncertainties either not known as of the date of this report or that are currently believed to not be material to the business, may have a material impact on the business, financial condition, or results of operations of IDACORP and Idaho Power and could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in any forward-looking statements. These risk factors, as well as other information in this report, including without limitation, in Part II - Item 7 - ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Matters Impacting Future Results"" in this report, and information in other reports the companies file with the SEC, may be important to understanding any statement in this 2021 Annual Report or elsewhere and should be considered carefully when making any investment decisions relating to IDACORP or Idaho Power. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's businesses regularly face risks, many of which may cause future results to be different than anticipated as of the date of this report. Below are certain important utility-specific regulatory, operational, legal and compliance, financial and investment, and general business risks. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's reactions to material future developments as well as the utility industry's reactions to those developments may also impact the Companies' future results.Utility-Specific Regulatory RisksUtility-specific regulatory risk includes the risks that federal, state, or local regulators may impose additional requirements and costs on Idaho Power and the utility industry, reduce authorized rates of return or otherwise adversely affect recovery of costs and the opportunity to earn a return on investments, or require Idaho Power as a utility to make adverse changes to its business models, strategies, and practices. State or federal regulators may not approve customer rates that provide timely or sufficient recovery of Idaho Power's costs or allow Idaho Power to earn a reasonable rate of return, which could cause IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations to be adversely affected. The prices that the IPUC and OPUC authorize Idaho Power to charge customers for its retail services, and the tariff rate that the FERC permits Idaho Power to charge for its transmission services, are significant factors influencing IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s business, results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition. Idaho Power's ability to recover its costs and earn a reasonable rate of return can be affected by many regulatory factors, including the timing difference between when Idaho Power incurs costs and when Idaho Power recovers those costs in customers’ rates (often called ""regulatory lag"" in the utility industry), and differences between the costs included in rates and the amount of actual costs incurred. Idaho Power expects to incur increasing costs, which is likely to occur before the IPUC, OPUC, or FERC approve the recovery of those costs, such as construction costs for new facilities and transmission resources, changes in the long-term cost-effectiveness or changes to the operating conditions of Idaho Power's assets that could result in early retirements of utility facilities, the costs of compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements, increased funding levels of Idaho Power's defined benefit pension plan, and the costs of damage from fires, climate change and weather-related events, and natural disasters. The IPUC, OPUC, and FERC may not allow Idaho Power to recover some or all of those costs on the basis that they find Idaho Power did not reasonably or prudently incur those costs or for other reasons. The IPUC and OPUC may adopt different methods of calculating the allocation of the total utility costs in their respective jurisdictions, resulting in certain costs excluded in both states. Ratemaking has generally been premised on estimates of historic costs based on a test year, so if a given year’s actual costs are higher than historic costs, rates may not be sufficient to cover actual costs. While rate regulation is also premised on the assumption that rates established are fair, just, and reasonable, regulators have considerable discretion in applying this standard. Economic, political, legislative, public policy, or regulatory pressures may lead stakeholders to seek rate reductions or refunds, limits on rate increases, or lower allowed rates of return on investments for Idaho Power. The ratemaking process typically involves multiple intervening parties, including governmental bodies, consumer advocacy groups, and customers, generally with the common objective of limiting rate increases or even reducing rates. In the past, Idaho Power has been denied recovery, or required to defer recovery pending the next general rate case, including denials or deferrals related to capital expenditures for long-term project expenses. Adverse outcomes in regulatory proceedings, or significant regulatory lag, may cause Idaho Power to incur increased or unrecovered project costs or result in cancellation of projects, or to record an impairment of its assets or otherwise adversely affect cash flows and earnings. This may also result in lower credit ratings, reduced access to capital, higher financing costs, and reductions or delays in planned capital expenditures.For additional information relating to Idaho Power's state and federal regulatory framework and regulatory matters, see Part I - Item 1 - ""Business - Utility Operations,"" Part II - Item 7 - ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 22Table of Contents                                      Results of Operations - Regulatory Matters,"" and Note 3 - ""Regulatory Matters"" to the consolidated financial statements of Part II - Item 8 in this report. Idaho Power's regulatory cost recovery mechanisms may not function as intended and are subject to change or elimination, which may adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power has power cost adjustment mechanisms in its Idaho and Oregon jurisdictions and a fixed cost adjustment mechanism in Idaho. The power cost adjustment mechanisms track Idaho Power’s actual net power supply costs (primarily fuel and purchased power less wholesale energy sales) and compare these amounts to net power supply costs being recovered in retail rates. A majority of the differences between these two amounts is deferred for future recovery from, or refund to, customers through rates. Volatility in power supply costs continues to be significant, in large part due to fluctuations in hydropower generation conditions, fuel cost variability from supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures, general supply and demand economics for fuel and power, the impact of high costs for the purchase of renewable energy under mandatory long-term contracts, and market price variability for the purchase of power from third parties based on seasonal demands and transmission system constraints. While the power cost adjustment mechanisms function to mitigate the potentially adverse impact on net income of power supply cost volatility, the mechanisms do not eliminate the cash flow impact of that volatility. When power costs rise above the level recovered in current retail rates, Idaho Power incurs the costs but recovery of those costs is deferred to a subsequent collection period, which can adversely affect Idaho Power’s operating cash flow and liquidity until those costs are recovered from customers. The fixed cost adjustment mechanism is a decoupling mechanism that allows Idaho Power to charge Idaho residential and small commercial customers when it recovers less than the base level of fixed costs per customer that the IPUC authorized for recovery in the most recent general rate case. The power cost and fixed cost adjustment mechanisms are generally subject to change at the discretion of applicable state regulators, who could decide to modify or eliminate either mechanism in a manner that adversely impacts IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. In December 2021, the IPUC approved Idaho Power's proposed modifications to the fixed cost adjustment mechanism (FCA) to institute separate, and reduced, fixed cost tracking for customers added to Idaho Power's system after December 31, 2021. In January 2022, the IPUC approved Idaho Power's proposed modifications to the power cost adjustment mechanism (PCA), which would simplify the mechanism without impairing the intent or effectiveness of the PCA and have no material impact on overall cost recovery.  Operational RisksOperational risk relates to risks arising from the systems, assets, processes, people, and external factors that affect the operation of IDACORP's or Idaho Power's businesses.The ongoing impacts of COVID-19 could adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's business functions, financial condition, and results of operations. The COVID-19 public health crisis has had, and continues to have, widespread impacts on the global economy and on Idaho Power's employees, customers, contractors, and suppliers, and there is considerable uncertainty regarding the duration and intensity of the COVID-19 public health crisis. At the peak of the public health crisis, authorities implemented various measures to reduce the spread of the virus, such as restrictive orders and mandates (including those in effect in Idaho Power's service area in the states of Idaho and Oregon), as well as business and government shutdowns. While governmental authorities have eased restrictions and vaccines are available, it is possible that an increase in COVID-19 cases or variants or their severity could prompt a return to tighter restrictions in some or all of the states and countries in which Idaho Power and its contractors and suppliers operate. Restrictions of this nature are difficult to predict and may cause Idaho Power or its contractors to miss milestones on construction and generation resource projects and experience operational delays, delay the delivery of electrical infrastructure and other supplies that it sources from around the globe, delay the connection of electric service to new customers, prolong the time period necessary to perform maintenance of infrastructure, and reduce the use of electricity by commercial and industrial customers. For example, several suppliers and contractors have notified Idaho Power that they will be unable to timely perform services or deliver products due to supply chain and workforce disruptions associated with the public health crisis, and some have attempted to rely on force majeure provisions in their contracts with Idaho Power to permit a delay in performance. These delays could result in untimely completion of infrastructure projects, which could adversely affect Idaho Power’s operations and financial condition. The federal government has issued, and may continue to issue, mandates related to COVID-19 vaccines, testing, and other restrictions and requirements that may be applied to Idaho Power and its workforce. Idaho Power is uncertain to what extent the requirements could disrupt the supply chain or result in Idaho Power losing skilled or specialized employees or limit Idaho Power’s ability to attract and retain skilled or specialized employees who are unwilling to abide by such restrictions, such as obtaining a vaccine or subjecting themselves to masking and weekly testing. Idaho Power, based on discussions with employees, does believe that attrition of skilled workers could result from application of a mandate for COVID-19 vaccines and masking and testing requirements to Idaho Power's workforce. If Idaho Power loses key portions of its skilled or specialized 23Table of Contents                                      workforce, or significant supply chain disruptions occur, those events could adversely impact Idaho Power's ability to provide reliable service to its customers and its business and results of operations. Further, while Idaho Power has implemented numerous COVID-19-related safety measures, Idaho Power has a limited number of highly skilled operators for some of its critical power plants and its grid operations centers. If a large portion of Idaho Power's employees in those critical facilities were to contract COVID-19 at the same time, Idaho Power would need to rely upon its business continuity plans in an effort to continue operations at those facilities. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the adverse impact to its operations. Additionally, the uncertainty around and impacts of COVID-19 on IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s business operations and access to capital, on their customers, and on the utility industry and economy as a whole, could adversely impact IDACORP’s financial condition, and business operations. For example, the costs related to Idaho Power's noncontributory defined benefit pension plan, as well as a defined benefit postretirement benefit plan (consisting of health care and death benefits) that covers eligible retirees, are based in part on the value of the plans’ assets and, therefore, adverse investment performance for these assets or the failure to maintain sustained growth in pension investments over time could increase its plan costs and funding requirements related to the plans. Similarly, IDACORP and Idaho Power rely on access to the capital markets to fund capital requirements. To the extent that access to the capital markets is adversely affected by COVID-19, IDACORP and Idaho Power may need to consider alternative sources of funding, such as existing or additional credit facilities, for its operations and for working capital, which may increase its cost of, as well as adversely impact its access to, capital. Increased volatility or significant disruptions in the global financial markets due to COVID-19 could impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's ability to comply with debt covenants. These uncertain economic conditions may also result in the inability of Idaho Power's customers to pay for electric service, which could affect the collectability of its revenues and adversely affect its financial results.The degree to which COVID-19 may continue to impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations is unknown at this time and will depend on future developments, including the continuing spread of the virus and variants, the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, the effectiveness and deployment rate of vaccines, and actions that may be taken by governmental authorities.Changes in customer growth and customer usage may negatively affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's business, financial condition, and results of operations. Changes in the number of customers and customers' use of electricity are affected by a number of factors, such as population growth or decline in Idaho Power's service area, expansion or loss of service area, changes in customer needs and expectations, adoption rates of energy efficiency measures, customer-generated power such as from solar panels and gas-fired generators, demand-side management requirements, regulation or deregulation, and adverse economic conditions. An economic downturn or recession, as a result of the COVID-19 public health crisis or otherwise, could also negatively impact customer use and reduce revenues and cash flows, thus adversely affecting results of operations. Many electric utilities, including Idaho Power, have experienced a decline in usage per customer, in part attributable to energy efficiency activities. State or federal regulations may be enacted to encourage or require mandatory energy conservation or technological advances that increase energy efficiency, which could further reduce usage per customer. Also, changing customer needs and expectations and increased competition from customer-owned generation could lead to lower customer satisfaction, reduced loyalty, difficulty in obtaining rate increases, legislation to deregulate electric service, and customers seeking alternative sources of energy and electric service. If customers choose to generate their own energy, discontinue a portion or all service from Idaho Power, or replace electric power for heating with natural gas, demand for Idaho Power's energy may decline and adversely impact the affordability of its services for remaining customers. While Idaho Power has recently experienced a net growth in usage due to an increase in the number of customers, when adjusted for the impacts of weather, the average monthly usage on a per customer basis for Idaho Power's residential customers has declined from 1,042 kilowatt-hour (kWh) in 2011 to 945 kWh in 2021. Rate mechanisms, such as the Idaho fixed cost adjustment for residential and small commercial customers, are designed to address the financial disincentive associated with promoting energy efficiency activities, but there is no assurance that the mechanism will result in full or timely collection of Idaho Power's fixed costs, which are currently collected in large part through the company's volume-based energy rates that are based on historical sales volume. Any undercollection of fixed costs would adversely impact revenues, earnings, and cash flows. The formation of municipal utilities or similar entities for distribution systems within Idaho Power's service area could also result in a load decrease. The loss of loads resulting from some of these events may result in excess infrastructure and stranded costs and require IDACORP and Idaho Power to modify or eliminate large generation or transmission projects. This could in turn result in reduced revenues as well as write-downs or write-offs if regulators determine that the costs of the projects were incurred imprudently, which could have a material adverse impact on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 24Table of Contents                                      Conversely, if Idaho Power were to experience an unanticipated increase in the demand for energy through, for example, the rapid addition of new industrial and commercial customers or population growth in the service area, Idaho Power may be required to rely on higher-cost purchased power to meet peak system demand and may need to accelerate investment in additional generation or transmission resources. Idaho Power's 2021 IRP's preferred resource portfolio and action plan included a need to acquire significant generation and storage resources to meet forecasted increasing energy and capacity needs. Idaho Power issued requests for proposals in June 2021 and December 2021 for additional energy resources, including renewables or natural gas resource convertible to hydrogen gas power, as described in Part 1, Item 1 - ""Resource Planning and Renewable Energy Projects"" in this report. If the incremental costs associated with unanticipated changes in loads exceed the incremental revenue received from the sales to the new customers, and Idaho Power is unable to secure timely and full rate relief to recover those increased costs, the resulting imbalance could have an adverse effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.Changes in weather conditions, severe weather, and the impacts of climate change can adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's operating results and cause them to fluctuate seasonally. Idaho Power's electric power sales are seasonal, with demand in Idaho Power's service area peaking during the hot summer months, with a secondary peak during the cold winter months. Electric power demands by irrigation customers in Idaho Power's service area, which are impacted by temperatures and the timing and amount of precipitation, can also create significant seasonal changes in usage. Seasonality of revenues may be further impacted by Idaho Power's tiered rate structure, under which rates charged to customers are often higher during higher-load periods, such as hot summers and cold winters. Market prices for power also often increase significantly during these peak periods, at times when Idaho Power is required to purchase power in the wholesale markets to meet customer demand. While Idaho Power has regulatory mechanisms to help mitigate the impact of weather on power supply costs, there is no assurance that it will continue to receive such regulatory protection in the future. By contrast, when temperatures are relatively mild or where precipitation supplants irrigation systems, loads are often lower as customers are not using electricity for heating and air conditioning or irrigation purposes. Thus, weather conditions and the timing and extent of precipitation can cause IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition to fluctuate seasonally, quarterly, and from year to year. Climate change could also have significant physical effects in Idaho Power’s service area, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, lightning, high winds, icing events, droughts, heat waves, fires, floods, snow loading, and other extreme weather events. These extreme weather events and their associated impacts could damage transmission, distribution, and generation facilities, causing service interruptions and extended or mass outages, increasing costs, and limiting Idaho Power's ability to meet customer energy demand. Sustained drought conditions or decreased snow pack due to reduced precipitation or higher temperatures are likely to decrease power generation from hydropower plants. Idaho Power's customers' energy needs vary with weather and to the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, customers' energy use could increase or decrease. Increased energy use due to weather changes may require Idaho Power to invest in generating assets and transmission and distribution infrastructure, while decreased energy use due to weather changes may result in decreased revenues. Extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand may raise wholesale electricity prices for power that Idaho Power purchases to serve customers, increasing the cost of energy Idaho Power provides to its customers, and at the same time can increase the revenues Idaho Power receives for wholesale market sales of excess generation during regional extreme weather events. Variations in hydropower generation that increase Idaho Power's reliance on market purchases may lead to more costly power supply sources for its customers and reduce benefits from selling surplus hydropower in the wholesale market. The price of power in the wholesale energy markets tends to be higher during periods of high regional demand that tends to occur with weather extremes, which may cause Idaho Power to purchase power in the wholesale market during peak price periods, increasing power supply costs. Idaho Power has in place mechanisms to help mitigate the effects of energy market price volatility, but there is no assurance these mechanisms will continue to be in place or function as intended.The costs of repairing and replacing infrastructure or liability for personal injury, loss of life, and property damage from utility equipment that fails, including as a result of significant weather and weather-related events and the increasing threat of fires, may not be covered in full by insurance. Costs incurred in connection with such events might also not be recovered through customer rates if the costs incurred are greater than those allowed for recovery by regulators. In addition, state and federal legislation and regulations have been proposed in recent years and may be implemented in the future, intended to limit the severity and impact of climate change. Proposals have included imposing mandatory reductions in GHG emissions, which could increase Idaho Power’s power supply and compliance costs or require generation facilities to be retired early, resulting in potential stranded costs and write-downs or write-offs if Idaho Power is unable to fully recover investments in such facilities. If financial markets increasingly view climate change or GHG emissions as a financial or investment risk for electric utilities, it could negatively affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's ability to access debt and equity 25Table of Contents                                      capital markets on favorable terms. For additional information relating to legislation, regulations, and legal proceedings related to environmental matters, see Part II - Item 7 - “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Matters” in this report.New advances in power generation, energy efficiency, alternative energy sources, or other technologies that impact the power utility industry could decrease customer energy demand and revenues, which could have implications for generation and system planning. Advances in technology and changes in customer demand and preferences in the electric utility industry have encouraged the development of new technologies for power generation, renewable energy, energy storage, customer-owned generation, and energy efficiency. In particular, in recent years the net cost of solar and wind generation and storage technology has decreased significantly, and there are federal and state regulations, laws, and other incentives in place to help further reduce the net cost of solar and wind facilities. There is potential that customer-owned solar power generation systems, could become sufficiently cost-effective and efficient that an increasing number of Idaho Power's customers choose to install such systems on their homes or businesses, which in turn could require changes in the way Idaho Power builds and manages its distribution systems and substantial grid infrastructure costs, and at the same time reduce the demand for and sale of energy. Additionally, considerable emphasis has been placed on energy efficiency, such as LED lighting and high-efficiency appliances. Energy efficiency programs, including programs sponsored by Idaho Power under a directive from state regulatory commissions, are designed to reduce energy use and demand. The introduction of new technologies could pose risks in the form of reduced sales and new business models for energy services. These changes in technology could also alter the channels through which customers buy or utilize energy, including the potential formation of community-based, cooperative ownership or municipal structures, which could reduce Idaho Power's revenues or impact Idaho Power's expenses. A reduction in load, however, would not necessarily reduce Idaho Power's need for ongoing investments in its infrastructure to reliably serve its customers. If Idaho Power is unable to adjust its rate design or maintain adequate regulatory mechanisms allowing for timely cost recovery, declining usage from customer-owned generation sources and energy efficiency could result in under-recovery of Idaho Power's costs and investment in infrastructure, and reduce revenues, which would impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Acts or threats of terrorism, acts of war, social unrest, cyber or physical security attacks, and other malicious acts of individuals or groups seeking to disrupt Idaho Power's operations or the electric power grid or compromise data could adversely impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's business, financial condition, and results of operations. Idaho Power operates in an industry that requires the continuous use and operation of sophisticated information technology and increasingly complex operational technology systems and network infrastructure. Idaho Power's generation and transmission facilities and its grid operations are potential targets for terrorist acts and threats, acts of war, social unrest, cyber and physical security attacks, and other disruptive activities of individuals or groups, including by nation states or nation state-sponsored groups. There have been cyber and physical attacks within the energy industry on energy infrastructure such as electric substations and pipelines in the past, and there are likely to be additional attacks in the future. Idaho Power and its vendors have been subject to, and will likely continue to be subject to, attempts to gain unauthorized access to systems and confidential information, or to disrupt operations. As noted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the utility industry is continuing to experience an increase in the frequency and sophistication of cybersecurity incidents.  Some of Idaho Power's facilities are deemed ""critical infrastructure"" under federal standards, in that incapacity or destruction of the facilities could have a debilitating impact on security, reliability or operability of the bulk electric power system, national economic security, and public health and safety. The fact that infrastructure facilities, such as power generation facilities and electric transmission or distribution facilities, are direct targets of, or potential indirect casualties of, an act of terror or cyber or physical attack (whether originating internal to Idaho Power or externally), may affect Idaho Power's operations by limiting the ability to generate, purchase, or transmit power. Idaho Power's electric transmission systems are part of an interconnected regional grid, and therefore, it faces the risk of causing or being subject to a long-term power outage due to grid disturbances or disruptions on a neighboring interconnected grid system. Cyber and physical threats and attacks can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across networks, information systems, and other technologies. Network, information systems, and technology-related events, including those caused by IDACORP or Idaho Power through process breakdowns, human error, security architecture or design vulnerabilities, or by third parties through cyber or physical security attacks, could result in a degradation or disruption in the energy grid and the services of the companies, as well as the ability to record, process, and report customer, business, and financial information. Physical or cyber attacks against key suppliers or service providers could have a similar effect on Idaho Power.Idaho Power's business operations require the continuous availability of information technology systems and network infrastructure, and in the normal course of business, Idaho Power or its vendors collect and store sensitive and confidential customer and employee information and proprietary information of Idaho Power. Idaho Power’s technology systems are 26Table of Contents                                      dependent upon connectivity to the internet and third-party vendors to host, maintain, modify, and update its systems, which may experience significant system failures or cyber attacks that could compromise the security of Idaho Power’s assets and information. During 2020 and into 2021, as just one example, a sophisticated security breach of the SolarWinds software platform used by Idaho Power and broadly across industry sectors, including the utility industry and many of the industry’s vendors, created a cyber security vulnerability for thousands of companies in the United States as well as a number of governmental entities. All information technology systems are vulnerable to disability, unauthorized access, unintentional defects, user error, errors in system changes, and cybersecurity incidents. Idaho Power is in the process of pursuing complex business system upgrades, and these significant changes increase the risk of system interruption. Any data security breaches, such as misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in Idaho Power's information technology systems or on third-party systems, including customer or employee data, could result in violations of privacy and other laws and associated litigation and liability for damages, fines, and penalties; financial loss to Idaho Power or to its customers; customer dissatisfaction or diminished customer confidence; and damage to Idaho Power’s reputation, all of which could materially affect Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. No security measures can completely shield Idaho Power's systems, infrastructure, and data from vulnerabilities to cyber attacks, human error, intrusions, or other catastrophic events that could result in their failure or reduced functionality, and ultimately the potential loss of sensitive information or the loss of Idaho Power's ability to fulfill critical business functions and provide reliable electric power to customers. Despite the steps Idaho Power may take to detect, mitigate, or eliminate threats and respond to security incidents, the techniques used by those who seek to obtain unauthorized access, and possibly disable or sabotage systems or abscond with information and data, change frequently and Idaho Power may not be able to protect against all such actions. Idaho Power actively monitors developments in the area of cybersecurity and is involved in various related government and industry groups, and the company’s board receives security updates at least quarterly. Although Idaho Power continues to make investments in its cybersecurity program, including personnel, technologies, cyber insurance and training of personnel, there can be no assurance that these systems or their expected functionality will be implemented, maintained, or expanded effectively; nor can security measures completely eliminate the possibility of a cybersecurity breach. Further, the implementation of security guidelines and measures has resulted in and Idaho Power expects to continue to result in increased costs. Idaho Power maintains insurance related to many forms of cyber and physical security events; however, such insurance is subject to exclusions and may be insufficient in amount to offset any losses, costs, or damage experienced, particularly given the potential significant magnitude of a security incident like those reported broadly in the media, and further, any such insurance may become unreasonably expensive or unavailable in the future. Terrorist attacks, acts of war, social unrest, cyber and physical security attacks, and similar incidents can also have indirect impacts by creating political, economic, social, or financial market instability, and can cause damage to or interference with Idaho Power’s operating assets, customers, or suppliers. This may result in business interruption, lost revenue, higher commodity prices, disruption in fuel supplies, lower energy consumption, and unstable commodity and financial markets, particularly with respect to electricity and natural gas, any of which may materially adversely affect Idaho Power. These events, and governmental actions in response, could result in a material decrease in revenues and increase costs to protect, repair, and insure Idaho Power's assets and operate its infrastructure, systems, and business.Changes in capital expenditures for infrastructure and the risks associated with permitting and construction of utility infrastructure can significantly affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power’s business is capital intensive and requires significant investments in power supply, transmission, and distribution infrastructure. A significant portion of Idaho Power’s facilities were constructed many years ago, and thus require periodic upgrades and frequent maintenance. Also, short-term and long-term anticipated increases in both the number of customers and the demand for energy require expansion and reinforcement of that infrastructure as described in Idaho Power's 2021 IRP. Idaho Power is not only in the permitting process for two high-voltage transmission line projects, but has issued requests for proposals for new capacity resources, and utility-scale battery storage, which are intended to help meet increasing customer energy demands. Idaho Power expects significant investment in capital improvements and expenditures for infrastructure projects that are subject to usual permitting and construction risks that can adversely affect project costs and the completion time. These risks include, as examples:•the ability to timely obtain labor or materials at reasonable costs;•defaults and delays by suppliers and contractors, including delays for specialty equipment that require significant lead times; •equipment, engineering, and design failures; •unexpected environmental and geological problems;•the effects of adverse weather conditions; 27Table of Contents                                      •catastrophic events, natural disasters, pandemics and other public health events;•availability of financing; •the ability to obtain approval from local, state, or federal regulatory and governmental bodies and to comply with permits and land use rights, and environmental constraints; and•delays and costs associated with disputes and litigation with third parties. The occurrence of any of these risks could cause Idaho Power to operate at reduced capacity levels, which in turn could reduce revenues and reliability, increase expenses, or cause Idaho Power to incur penalties. If Idaho Power is unable to complete the permitting or construction of a project, or incurs costs that regulators do not deem prudent, it may be unable to recover its costs in full through rates or on a timely basis. Further, if Idaho Power is unable to secure permits or joint funding commitments to develop transmission infrastructure necessary to serve loads or if other resources become more economical, it may terminate those projects and, as alternatives, seek to develop additional generation facilities within areas where Idaho Power has available transmission capacity or pursue other more costly options to serve loads. To limit the timing-related risks of these projects, Idaho Power may enter into purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals or permits. If any of the projects are canceled for any reason, including Idaho Power's failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals or permits or because the project is no longer economical, Idaho Power could incur significant cancellation penalties under purchase orders or construction contracts. Additionally, termination of a project carries with it the potential for impairment of the associated asset if regulators deny full recovery of project costs. Thus, termination of a project could negatively affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.Demand for power during peak periods could exceed forecasted supply, resulting in deliverability risks and increased costs for purchasing capacity in the market or acquiring or constructing additional generation resources and battery storage facilities. Idaho Power's 2021 IRP identified a low-cost preferred resource portfolio and action plan for the next 20-year period that includes adding substantial renewable resources and ending participation in the remaining coal-fired units by the end of 2028. As Idaho Power implements the IRP's action plan, which also advances its goal to provide 100 percent clean energy by 2045, it remains obligated to provide reliable and affordable energy to its customers, but there are certain potential deliverability and cost risks associated with this transition. These risks include, but are not limited to, (1) the failure to timely obtain or construct additional resources to meet forecast needs related to load growth and coal exits, (2) increased renewable energy generation presenting risks of uncertainty and variability that could be further compounded as neighboring systems transition towards increasing levels of renewable resources, and (3) increased potential resource volatility due to changes in the energy market. During peak periods, power demand could exceed Idaho Power’s forecasted available generation capacity, particularly if Idaho Power’s power plants are not performing as anticipated and additional resources and battery storage are not acquired as needed to meet demand. Competitive market forces or adverse regulatory actions may require Idaho Power to purchase capacity and energy from the market, if such resources are even available for purchase, or build additional resources to meet customers’ energy needs in an expedited manner. If that occurs, Idaho Power may be unable to recover these additional costs and could experience a lag between when costs are incurred and when regulators permit recovery in customers’ rates, which could have negative impacts on operations and cash flows. Factors contributing to lower hydropower generation can increase costs and negatively impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power derives a significant portion of its power supply from its hydropower facilities. During 2020 and 2021, 54 percent and 48 percent, respectively, of Idaho Power's electric power from Idaho Power-owned generation was from hydropower facilities. Due to Idaho Power’s heavy reliance on hydropower generation, the impacts of climate change and factors such as precipitation and snowpack, the timing of run-off, and the availability of water in the Snake River Basin can significantly affect its operations. The combination of a long-term trend of declining Snake River base flows, over-appropriation of water, and periods of drought have led to water rights disputes and proceedings among surface water and ground water irrigators and the State of Idaho. Recharging the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer by diverting surface water to porous locations and permitting it to sink into the aquifer is one approach to the over-appropriation dispute. Diversions from the Snake River for aquifer recharge or the loss of water rights reduce Snake River flows available for hydropower generation. When hydropower generation is reduced, Idaho Power must increase its use of more expensive thermal generating resources and market power purchases; therefore, costs increase and opportunities for wholesale energy sales are reduced, reducing revenues and potentially earnings. Through its power cost adjustment mechanisms, Idaho Power expects to recover most (but not all) of the increase in net power supply costs caused by lower hydropower generation. The timing of recovery of the increased costs, however, may not occur until the subsequent power cost adjustment year, adversely affecting cash flows and liquidity.Idaho Power’s use of coal and natural gas to fuel power generation facilities exposes it to commodity availability and price risk, which can adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition. As part of its 28Table of Contents                                      normal business operations, Idaho Power purchases coal and natural gas in the open market or under short-term or long-term contracts, often with variable pricing terms. Market prices for coal and natural gas are volatile and influenced by factors impacting supply and demand such as weather conditions, the adequacy and type of generating capacity, fuel transportation availability, economic conditions, regulations related to GHG emissions, changes in technology, moratoriums on federally leased coal, and increases in coal lease costs. Natural gas transportation to Idaho Power's three natural gas plants is limited to one primary pipeline, presenting a heightened possibility of supply constraint and disruptions separate from the risk of counterparty default. Most of Idaho Power's coal supply arrangements are under long-term contracts for coal originating in Wyoming, and thus Idaho Power is exposed to risk of disruption of coal production in, or transportation from, that region. Idaho Power may from time to time enter into new, or renegotiate, these long-term contracts but can provide no assurance that such contracts will be negotiated or renegotiated on satisfactory terms, or at all. There also can be no assurance that counterparties to the natural gas or coal supply agreements will fulfill their obligations to supply natural gas or coal, and they may experience regulatory, financial, or technical problems or unforeseeable events that inhibit their ability to deliver natural gas or coal. Disruptions in transportation of fuel and defaults by coal and natural gas suppliers may cause Idaho Power to seek alternative, and potentially more costly, sources of fuel or rely on other generation sources or wholesale market power purchases. Idaho Power's failure to provide service due to such disruptions may also result in fines, penalties, or cost disallowances through the regulatory process. Idaho Power may not be able to fully or timely recover these increased costs through rates and power cost adjustment mechanisms, which may adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power’s power supply, transmission, and distribution facilities are subject to numerous operational risks unique to it and its industry, including circumstances causing power outages, injuries and property damage, loss of life, and fires. Operating risks associated with Idaho Power's power supply, transmission, and distribution facilities include equipment failures, volatility in fuel and transportation pricing, interruptions in fuel supplies, increased regulatory compliance costs, changes necessitated by environmental legislation or litigation, labor disputes or attrition, accidents and workforce safety matters, environmental damage, property damage, wildfires, acts of terrorism or sabotage (both cyber and asset-based), the loss of cost-effective disposal options for solid waste such as coal ash, operator error, and the occurrence of catastrophic events at the facilities. Diminished availability or performance of those facilities could result in reduced customer satisfaction, reputational harm, liability to third parties (including tort liability), and regulatory inquiries and fines. Operation of Idaho Power's owned and co-owned generating stations below expected capacity levels, or unplanned outages at these stations, could cause reduced energy output and lower efficiency levels and result in lost revenues and increased expenses for alternative fuels or wholesale market power purchases. Further, during high-load periods the transmission system in Idaho Power's service area is constrained, limiting the ability to transmit electric energy within the service area and access electric energy from outside the service area. Idaho Power's transmission facilities are also interconnected with those of third parties, and thus operation of Idaho Power's and third-parties' facilities could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events. These transmission constraints and events could result in failure to provide reliable service to customers and the inability to deliver energy from generating facilities to the power grid, and the inability to access lower cost sources of electric energy. Idaho Power also enters into agreements with third-party contractors to perform work on its power supply, transmission, and distribution facilities, and may in some circumstances retain liability for the quality and completion of those contractors’ work, potentially subjecting Idaho Power to penalties, liability for personal injury, loss of life, or property damage, reputational harm, or enforcement actions or liability if a contractor violates applicable laws, rules, regulations, or orders.Accidents, terrorist acts, electrical contacts, fires, explosions, catastrophic failures, general system damage or dysfunction, intentional acts of destruction, uncontrolled release of water from hydropower dams, and other unplanned events related to Idaho Power's infrastructure would increase repair costs and may expose Idaho Power to liability for personal injury, loss of life, and property damage. Fires alleged to have been caused by Idaho Power's transmission, distribution, or generation infrastructure, or that allegedly result from Idaho Power’s or its contractors’ operating or maintenance practices, could also expose Idaho Power to claims for fire suppression and clean-up costs, evacuation costs, fines and penalties, and liability for economic damages, personal injury, loss of life, property damage, and environmental pollution, whether based on claims of negligence, trespass, or otherwise. The risk of wildfires is exacerbated in forested areas where beetle infestations and rising tree mortality rates have caused a significant increase in the quantity of standing dead and dying timber, increasing the risk that such trees may fall from either inside or outside our right-of-way into a powerline igniting a fire and increasing the magnitude of fires. A significant number of urban-wildland interfaces in and near Idaho Power's service area, and commonly hot, dry summer conditions that may worsen as a result of climate change, increase the likelihood and magnitude of damages that may be caused by fires burning into or allegedly originating from utility equipment. Further, there has been an increasing trend in the degree of annual destruction from wildfires in the western United States. Idaho Power maintains insurance coverage for such operating and event risks, but insurance coverage is subject to the terms and limitations of the available policies and may not be sufficient in amount to cover Idaho Power’s ultimate liability. Coverage limits within wildfire insurance policies could result in material self-insured costs in the event there are fires that are deemed to be separate occurrences covered by self-insured retention 29Table of Contents                                      amounts under the terms of Idaho Power’s insurance policies. Idaho Power or its contractors and customers could also experience coverage reductions and increased wildfire insurance costs in future years. Idaho Power may be unable to fully recover costs in excess of insurance through customer rates or regulatory mechanisms and, even if such recovery is possible, it could take several years to collect. If the amount of insurance is insufficient or otherwise unavailable, and if Idaho Power is unable to fully recover in rates the costs of uninsured losses, IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially affected.Purchases of power from renewable energy projects, and integration of power generated from those projects into Idaho Power's system, may increase costs and decrease system reliability, and adversely affect Idaho Power's and IDACORP's results of operations and financial condition. An abundance of intermittent, non-dispatchable generation from renewable energy projects interconnected with Idaho Power's system has had an impact on the operation of Idaho Power's generation plants, system reliability, power supply costs, and the wholesale power markets. Idaho Power is generally obligated under federal law to purchase power from certain renewable energy projects, regardless of the then-current load demand, availability of lower cost generation resources, or wholesale energy market prices. As of December 31, 2021, Idaho Power had federally-mandated contracts to purchase energy from 129 on-line projects with third parties. This increases the likelihood and frequency that Idaho Power will be required to reduce output from its lower-cost hydropower and fossil fuel-fired generation resources, which in turn increases power purchase costs and customer rates and impacts Idaho Power's ability to invest in additional generation and earn a reasonable return on rate base in the future. Further, balancing load and generation from Idaho Power's power generation portfolio is challenging, and Idaho Power expects that its operational and infrastructure costs will continue to increase as a result of its efforts to integrate intermittent, non-dispatchable generation from a large number of renewable energy projects. If Idaho Power is unable to timely recover those costs through its rates, power cost adjustment mechanisms, or otherwise, those increased costs may negatively affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's activities are concentrated in one industry and in one region, which exposes it to risks from lack of diversification, regional economic conditions, and regional legislation and regulation. IDACORP and Idaho Power do not have diversified operations or sources of revenue. Idaho Power comprises the bulk of IDACORP's operations, and Idaho Power's business is concentrated solely in the electricity industry. Furthermore, Idaho Power's provision of electric service to retail customers is conducted exclusively in its southern Idaho and eastern Oregon service area. As a result, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's future performance, revenues, and collectability of revenues, as well as expenses, will be affected by regional economic conditions, regulatory and legislative activity, weather conditions, and other events and conditions in its service area and in the electric power industry.  The impacts of a retiring workforce with specialized utility-specific functions and the inability to hire qualified third-party vendors could increase costs and adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power’s operations require a skilled workforce to perform specialized utility functions. Many of these positions, such as linemen, grid operators, engineering and design personnel, and generation plant operators, require extensive, specialized training. At December 31, 2021, approximately 16 percent of Idaho Power's employees were eligible for regular or early retirement under Idaho Power's defined benefit pension plan. This will require Idaho Power to attract, train, and retain new employees to help prevent a loss of institutional knowledge and avoid a skills gap. Idaho Power does not have employment contracts with its officers or key employees and cannot guarantee that any member of its management or any key employee at the IDACORP parent or any subsidiary level will continue to serve in any capacity for any particular period of time. The loss of skills and institutional knowledge of experienced employees, the failure to foster an innovative, inclusive, equitable, and diverse environment in order to hire appropriately qualified employees, the costs associated with attracting, training, and retaining such employees to replace an aging and skilled workforce or the inability to do so, and the operational and financial costs of unionization or the attempt to unionize all or part of the companies’ workforce, could have a negative effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power could incur increased costs due to such turnover due to a loss of knowledge, errors due to inexperienced employees or substantial training time, loss of productivity, and increased safety compliance issues.Idaho Power also hires third-party vendors to assist in performing a variety of ordinary business functions, such as power plant maintenance, data warehousing and management, software development and licensing, electric transmission and distribution operations, billing and metering processes, and vegetation management, among other things. In recent years, Idaho Power has experienced increased competition and rising prices for many forms of third-party vendor services. While Idaho Power does not rely entirely on third-party vendors for many of these business functions, the unavailability of such vendors could adversely affect the quality and cost of Idaho Power's electric service and negatively impact its results of operation.Legal and Compliance Risks30Table of Contents                                      Legal and compliance risk relates to risks arising from government and regulatory action and from legal proceedings and compliance with applicable laws, rules, orders, regulations, policies, and procedures, including those related to financial reporting, environmental, health, and safety, and potential changes in legal requirements.Changes in legislation, regulation, and government policy may have a material adverse effect on IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s business in the future. Specific legislative and regulatory proposals and recently enacted legislation that could have a material impact on IDACORP and Idaho Power include, but are not limited to, tax reform, utility regulation, carbon-reduction initiatives, infrastructure renewal programs, climate change and environmental regulation, and modifications to accounting and public company reporting requirements. Further, the proposals and new legislation could have an impact on the rate of growth of Idaho Power’s customers and their willingness to expand operations and increase electric service requirements. Under the current Presidential Administration, Idaho Power expects laws, regulations, and policies relating to environmental compliance to continue to change and require IDACORP and Idaho Power and some of their customers to modify their business strategy or restrict activities and projects, potentially subjecting them to increased compliance costs. For example, in January 2021, the United States rejoined the Paris Agreement on climate change that requires commitments related to GHG emissions, among other things, and the Presidential Administration has announced ambitious clean energy initiatives. Many states and localities may continue to pursue climate policies in addition to federal mandates. The state of Oregon, for instance, has been pursuing cap-and-trade legislation for GHG emissions. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if such non-compliance is caused by factors outside of Idaho Power's control, may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties or fines, or government enforcement actions. Idaho Power could also become subject to climate change lawsuits and an adverse outcome could require substantial expenditures and could possibly require payment of damages. IDACORP and Idaho Power expect federal, state, and local governmental authorities to implement various recent and expected future executive orders from the Presidential Administration and are unable to predict whether and to what extent such actions will meaningfully change existing legislative and regulatory environments relevant to the companies, or if any such changes would have a net positive or negative impact on the companies. Idaho Power is unable to estimate the costs of complying with such legislative or regulatory changes due to the uncertainties associated with the nature and implementation of the changes, and may not be able to recover the associated costs. To the extent that such changes have a negative impact on the companies or Idaho Power’s customers, including as a result of related uncertainty, these changes may materially and adversely impact IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.Changes in income tax laws and regulations, or differing interpretation or enforcement of applicable laws by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdictions, could have a material adverse impact on IDACORP’s or Idaho Power’s financial condition and results of operations. IDACORP and Idaho Power must make judgments and interpretations about the application of the law when determining the provision for income taxes. Amounts of income tax-related assets and liabilities involve judgments and estimates of the timing and probability of recognition of income, deductions, and tax credits, which are subject to challenge by taxing authorities. These judgments may include estimates for potential outcomes regarding tax positions that may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities. Disputes over interpretations of tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority in examination, upon appeal, or through litigation. In recent years, state regulatory mechanisms with income tax-related provisions (such as Idaho Power's May 2018 Idaho tax reform settlement stipulation approved by the IPUC), have significantly impacted IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations. Due to the current Presidential Administration, IDACORP and Idaho Power expect tax reform legislation could be enacted that may increase the companies' federal and state tax rates and reporting obligations. The outcome of potential future income tax proceedings or laws, or the state public utility commissions' treatment of those outcomes, could differ materially from the amounts IDACORP and Idaho Power record prior to conclusion of those proceedings, and the difference could negatively affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s earnings and cash flows. Further, in some instances, the treatment from a ratemaking perspective of any net income tax expense (including from increased tax rates) or benefit could be different than IDACORP or Idaho Power anticipate or request from applicable state regulatory commissions, which could have a negative effect on their financial condition and results of operations. In addition, Idaho Power uses the regulatory flow-through income tax accounting method as described in Note 1 - ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report, and potential changes in income tax laws or interpretations may impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's income taxes and reporting obligations differently than most other companies.IDACORP's and Idaho Power’s businesses are subject to an extensive set of environmental laws, rules, and regulations, which could impact their operations and costs of operations, potentially rendering some generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate, and could increase the costs and alter the timing of major projects. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's operations are subject to a number of federal, state, and local environmental statutes, rules, and regulations relating to climate change, air and water quality, natural resources, endangered species and wildlife, renewable energy, and health and safety. Many of these laws and regulations are described in Part II - Item 7 - “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial 31Table of Contents                                      Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Matters” in this report. These laws and regulations generally require IDACORP and Idaho Power to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, and other approvals, including through substantial investment in pollution controls, and may be enforced by both public officials and private individuals. Some of these regulations are pending, changing, or subject to interpretation, and failure to comply may result in penalties, mandatory operational changes, and other adverse consequences, including costs associated with defending against claims by governmental authorities or private parties and complying with new operating requirements. Idaho Power devotes significant resources to environmental monitoring, pollution control equipment, and mitigation projects to comply with existing and anticipated environmental regulations. However, it is possible that federal, state and local authorities could attempt to enforce more stringent standards, stricter regulation, and more expansive application of environmental regulations. Environmental regulations have created the need for Idaho Power to install new pollution control equipment at, and may cause Idaho Power to perform environmental remediation on, its owned and co-owned power generation facilities, often at a substantial cost. Compliance with environmental regulations can significantly increase capital spending, operating costs, and plant outages, and can negatively affect the affordability of Idaho Power's services for customers. Idaho Power cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures necessary to comply with these environmental laws and regulations, although Idaho Power expects the expenditures will be substantial. In some cases, the costs to obtain permits and ensure facilities are in compliance may be prohibitively expensive. If the costs of compliance with new regulations renders the generating facilities uneconomical to maintain or operate, Idaho Power would need to identify alternative resources for power, potentially in the form of new generation and transmission facilities, market power purchases, demand-side management programs, or a combination of these and other methods. Furthermore, Idaho Power may not be able to obtain or maintain all environmental regulatory approvals necessary for operation of its existing infrastructure or construction of new infrastructure.  The utility industry is also facing increasing stakeholder scrutiny related to its environmental, social, and governance (ESG) programs. Recently, Idaho Power has seen a rise in certain stakeholders, such as investors, customers, employees, and lenders placing increasing importance on the impact and social cost of their investments. Emissions of GHGs, including, most significantly CO2, could be further restricted in the future in response to additional state and federal regulatory requirements, increased scrutiny and changing stakeholder expectations with respect to environmental and climate change programs, judicial decisions and international accords. If new emissions reduction rules were to become effective, they could result in significant additional compliance costs that would affect Idaho Power's future financial position, results of operations, and cash flows if such costs are not timely recovered through regulated rates. Moreover, the possibility exists that stricter laws, regulations, or enforcement policies could significantly increase compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary. In addition, some environmental regulations are currently subject to litigation and not yet final. As a result of this uncertainty, approaches to comply with the regulations, including available control technologies or other allowed compliance measures, are unpredictable and Idaho Power cannot foresee the potential impacts these regulations would have on Idaho Power's operations or financial condition. In 2019, Idaho Power announced its commitment to serve customers with 100 percent clean energy by 2045, and Idaho Power has short-term and medium-term targets for CO2 emission reductions, which could impact infrastructure resource decisions and costs. Idaho Power's ability to achieve these targets are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the company's regulatory obligation to serve its customers, the availability and cost of new generation resources, legal and permitting requirements, system operation and energy integration, grid balancing, among others. Additionally, Idaho Power is not guaranteed timely or full recovery through customer rates of costs associated with environmental regulations, environmental compliance, its clean energy initiatives, plant closures, or clean-up of contamination. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if Idaho Power fails to obtain, maintain, or comply with any such approval, construction and/or operation of Idaho Power's generation or transmission facilities could be delayed, halted, terminated, or subjected to additional costs. For further discussion of environmental matters that may affect Idaho Power, see ""Environmental Matters"" in Item 7 - “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this report.Obligations imposed in connection with hydropower license renewals and permitting may require large capital expenditures, increase operating costs, reduce hydropower generation, and negatively affect IDACORP's or Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition. For the last several years, Idaho Power has been engaged in an effort to renew its federal license for its largest hydropower generation source, the HCC. Relicensing and ongoing permitting requirements include an extensive public review process that involves numerous natural resource issues and environmental conditions. The existence of endangered and threatened species in the watershed may result in major operational changes to the region’s hydropower projects, which may be reflected in hydropower licenses, including for the HCC and the American Falls facility. In addition, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to hydropower facilities, which could further increase required expenditures for marine life recovery and endangered species protection and reduce the amount of hydropower generation available to meet Idaho Power’s generation requirements. Idaho Power cannot predict the requirements that might be imposed during the relicensing and permitting process, the financial impact of those requirements, 32Table of Contents                                      whether a new multi-year license will ultimately be issued, and whether the IPUC or OPUC will allow recovery through rates of the substantial costs incurred in connection with the licensing process and subsequent compliance. Imposition of onerous conditions in the relicensing and permitting processes could result in Idaho Power incurring significant capital expenditures, increase operating costs (including power purchase costs), and reduce hydropower generation, which could negatively affect results of operations and financial condition.Idaho Power could be subject to penalties, reputational harm, and operational changes if it violates mandatory reliability and security requirements, which could adversely impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition. As an owner and operator of a bulk power transmission system, Idaho Power is subject to mandatory reliability and security standards issued by the FERC and other regulators. The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability, security, and market interface principles. Compliance with reliability standards subjects Idaho Power to higher operating costs and increased capital expenditures. Idaho Power has received in recent years notices of violations from, and regularly self-reports reliability standard compliance issues to, the FERC, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and the Western Electricity Coordinating Council. Potential monetary and non-monetary penalties for a violation of FERC regulations may be substantial, and in some circumstances monetary penalties may exceed $1.4 million per day per violation. As a utility with a large customer base, Idaho Power is subject to adverse publicity focused on the reliability of its services and the speed with which it is able to respond to electric outages caused by storm damage or other unanticipated events. Adverse publicity could harm the reputations of IDACORP and Idaho Power; may make state legislatures, utility commissions, and other regulatory authorities less likely to view the companies in a favorable light; and may cause Idaho Power to be subject to less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes or increased regulatory oversight. The imposition of any of the foregoing on Idaho Power for its actual or alleged failure to comply with reliability and security requirements could also have a negative effect on its and IDACORP’s results of operations and financial condition.IDACORP and Idaho Power are subject to costs and other effects of legal and regulatory proceedings, disputes, and claims. From time to time in the normal course of business, IDACORP and Idaho Power are subject to various lawsuits, regulatory proceedings, disputes, and claims that could result in adverse judgments or settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, or other adverse consequences. These matters are subject to a number of uncertainties, and management is often unable to predict the outcome of such matters; resulting liabilities could exceed amounts currently reserved or insured against with respect to such matter. The legal costs and final resolution of matters in which IDACORP or Idaho Power are involved could have reputational impact and a short- or long-term negative effect on their financial condition and results of operations. Addressing any adverse publicity or governmental scrutiny could be time consuming and expensive, regardless of the basis of the assertions being made, and could impact Idaho Power's relationship with employees, stakeholders, and regulators. Further, the terms of resolution could require the companies to change their operational practices and procedures, which could also have a negative effect on their financial positions and results of operations.Changes in accounting standards or rules may impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial results and disclosures. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the SEC have made and may continue to make changes to accounting standards that impact presentation and disclosures of financial condition and results of operations. Further, new accounting orders issued by the FERC could significantly impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's reported financial condition. IDACORP and Idaho Power do not have any control over the impact these changes may have on their financial conditions or results of operations nor the timing of such changes. Idaho Power meets the requirements under GAAP to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in its financial statements and to defer certain costs as regulatory assets until those costs are collected in rates, and to defer some items as regulatory liabilities. If recovery of these amounts ceases to be probable, if Idaho Power determines that it no longer meets the criteria for applying regulatory accounting or if accounting rules change to no longer provide for regulatory assets and liabilities, Idaho Power could be required to eliminate some or all of those regulatory assets or liabilities. Any of these circumstances could result in write-offs and have a material effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power’s financial condition and results of operations. Financial and Investment RisksFinancial and investment risks relate to IDACORP's and Idaho Power's ability to meet financial obligations and mitigate exposure to market risks, including liquidity risks and the ability to raise capital and cost of funding, risks related to credit ratings, credit risk, liquidity, interest rates, and commodity prices. Volatility or disruptions in the financial markets, failure of IDACORP or Idaho Power to satisfy conditions necessary for obtaining loans or issuing debt securities, and denial of regulatory authority to issue debt or equity securities, may negatively affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s ability to access capital and/or increase their cost of borrowing and ability to execute 33Table of Contents                                      on their strategic plans. IDACORP and Idaho Power use credit facilities, commercial paper markets, and long-term debt as significant sources of liquidity and funding for operating and capital requirements and debt maturities not satisfied by operating cash flow. The credit facilities represent commitments by the participating banks to make loans and issue letters of credit. However, the ability and obligation of the participating banks to make those loans and issue letters of credit is subject to specified conditions and volatility or disruptions in the financial markets could affect the companies' ability to obtain debt financing or draw upon or renew existing credit facilities on favorable terms and comply with debt covenants. Idaho Power's ability to issue long-term debt is also subject to a number of conditions included in an indenture, and Idaho Power's ability to issue long-term debt and commercial paper is subject to the availability of purchasers willing to purchase the securities under reasonable terms or at all. Because of these limitations, IDACORP and Idaho Power may be unable to issue commercial paper or short-term or long-term debt at reasonable interest rates and terms or at all. Higher interest rates on short-term borrowings with variable interest rates could also have an adverse effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's operating results. Changes in interest rates may also impact the fair value of the debt securities in Idaho Power's pension funds, as well as Idaho Power's ability to earn a return on short-term investments of excess cash. Also, while the credit facilities represent a contractual obligation to make loans, one or more of the participating banks may default on their obligations to make loans under, or may withdraw from, the credit facilities. Idaho Power is required to obtain regulatory approval in Idaho, Oregon, and Wyoming in order to borrow money or to issue securities and is therefore dependent on the public utility commissions of those states to issue favorable orders in a timely manner to permit them to finance their operations, capital expenditures, and debt maturities. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's credit facilities include financial covenants that limit the amount of debt that can be outstanding as a percentage of total capital, and Idaho Power's long-term debt has also been issued under an indenture that contains a number of financial covenants. The companies must also make specified representations in connection with request for loans and it is possible that they may be unable to do so at the time of such request, which would limit or eliminate the obligation of the banks to provide loans. Failure to maintain these representations and covenants could preclude IDACORP and Idaho Power from issuing commercial paper, borrowing under their credit facilities, or issuing long-term debt, and could trigger a default and repayment obligation under debt instruments, which could limit their ability to pursue certain projects, acquisitions, or improvements, to support future growth, and adversely impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.  A downgrade in IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s credit ratings could affect the companies’ ability to access capital, increase their cost of borrowing, and require the companies to post collateral with transaction counterparties. Credit rating agencies periodically review the corporate credit ratings and long-term ratings of IDACORP and Idaho Power. These ratings are premised on financial ratios and performance, the regulatory environment and rate mechanisms, the effectiveness of management, resource risks and power supply costs, and other factors. IDACORP and Idaho Power also have borrowing arrangements that rely on the ability of the banks to fund loans or support commercial paper, a principal source of short-term financing. In addition, IDACORP's or Idaho Power's credit ratings may change as a result of the differing methodologies or change in the methodologies used by the various rating agencies. Downgrades of IDACORP’s or Idaho Power’s credit ratings, or those affecting relationship banks, could limit the companies’ ability to access short- and long-term capital under reasonable terms or at all, reduce the pool of potential lenders, increase borrowing costs under existing credit facilities, limit access to the commercial paper market, require the companies to pay a higher interest rate on their debt, limit the ability of IDACORP to declare and make dividends, and require the companies to post additional performance assurance collateral with transaction counterparties. If access to capital were to become significantly constrained or costs of capital increased significantly due to lowered credit ratings, prevailing industry conditions, regulatory constraints, the volatility of the capital markets or other factors, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions (including generating capacity and transmission assets, which may be necessary for future growth), liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.Idaho Power’s energy risk management policy and programs relating to economically hedging commodity exposures and credit risk may not always perform as intended, and as a result, IDACORP and Idaho Power may suffer economic losses. Idaho Power enters into transactions to buy and sell power, natural gas, and transmission service, enters into transactions to hedge its positions in coal, natural gas, power, and other commodities, and enters into financial hedge transactions to mitigate in part exposure to variable commodity prices. IDACORP and Idaho Power could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market value of these contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform. The derivative instruments used for hedging might not offset the underlying exposure being mitigated as intended, due to pricing inefficiencies or other terms of the derivative instruments, and any such failure to mitigate exposure could result in financial losses. Certain of Idaho Power's purchase or sale, hedging, and derivative agreements may result in the receipt of, or posting of, collateral with counterparties. Fluctuations in commodity prices that lead to the posting of collateral with counterparties negatively impact liquidity, and downgrades in Idaho Power's credit ratings may lead to additional collateral posting requirements. Idaho Power has additional indirect credit exposures to financial institutions in the form of letters of credit provided as security by power suppliers under 34Table of Contents                                      various purchased power contracts and by vendors for infrastructure development projects. If any of the credit ratings of the letter of credit issuers were to drop below investment grade, the vendor or supplier would need to replace the security with an acceptable substitute, which may be impracticable and may expose Idaho Power to losses resulting from a vendor or supplier default. If the security were not replaced, the party could be in default under the contract and Idaho Power's remedies for default may be inadequate to fully compensate Idaho Power for its losses. Forecasts of future fuel needs and loads and available resources to meet those loads are inherently uncertain and may cause Idaho Power to over- or under-hedge actual resource needs, exposing the company to market risk on the over- or under-hedged position. To the extent that commodity markets are illiquid, Idaho Power may not be able to execute its risk management strategies, which could result in undesired over-exposure to unhedged positions that Idaho Power may not be able to collect in customer rates. The FERC may take action to limit volatility in the energy market by imposing price limits or other market restrictions to control market-based rate sales, which could adversely affect the companies' financial results. As a result, risk management actions, or the failure or inability to manage commodity availability and price and counterparty risk, may adversely affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s financial condition and results of operations. Further, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a counterparty to commodity or other transactions could impair Idaho Power’s ability to collect amounts receivable from those counterparties, potentially including the ability to collect or retain collateral posted by a counterparty. Idaho Power is a participant in the energy markets, including the Western EIM, and engages in direct and indirect power purchase and sale transactions in connection with that participation. The Western EIM has collateral posting requirements based on established credit criteria, but there is no assurance the collateral will be sufficient to cover obligations that counterparties may owe each other in the Western EIM and any such credit losses could be socialized to all Western EIM participants, including Idaho Power. A significant failure of a participant in the Western EIM to make payments when due on its obligations could have a ripple effect on various Idaho Power counterparties in the power, gas, and derivative markets if those counterparties experience ancillary liquidity issues, and could generally result in a decline in the ability of Idaho Power’s counterparties to perform on their obligations.  The performance of pension and postretirement benefit plan investments, increasing health care costs, and other factors impacting plan costs and funding obligations could adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations - primarily cash flows and liquidity. Idaho Power provides a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering most employees, as well as a defined benefit postretirement benefit plan (consisting of health care and death benefits) that covers eligible retirees. Costs of providing these benefits are based in part on the value of the plans' assets and, therefore, adverse investment performance for these assets or the failure to maintain sustained growth in pension investments over time could increase Idaho Power’s plan costs and funding requirements related to the plans. Idaho Power's self-insured costs of health care benefits for eligible employees and retirees have increased in recent years and Idaho Power believes that future legislative changes related to the provision of health care benefits and other external market conditions and factors, could cause such costs to continue to rise. As benefit costs continue to rise, there is no assurance that the IPUC and OPUC will continue to allow recovery. The key actuarial assumptions that affect pension funding obligations are the expected long-term return on plan assets and the discount rate used in determining future benefit obligations. Idaho Power evaluates the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis, taking into account changes in market conditions, trends, and future expectations. Estimates of future investment market performance, changes in interest rates, and other factors Idaho Power and its actuary firms use to develop the actuarial assumptions are inherently uncertain, and actual results could vary significantly from the estimates. Changes in demographics, including timing of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase Idaho Power's plan costs and funding requirements. Future pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments are also subject to the impacts of changes in legislation. Depending on the timing of contributions to the plans and Idaho Power's ability to recover costs through rates, cash contributions to the plans could reduce the cash available for the companies' businesses and payment of dividends. For additional information regarding Idaho Power's funding obligations under its benefit plans, see Note 12 - ""Benefit Plans"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. If the assumptions underlying coal mine reclamation at Bridger Coal Company and related forecast trust fund growth are materially inaccurate, Idaho Power’s costs could be greater than anticipated or be incurred sooner than anticipated. Bridger Coal Company (BCC), a subsidiary of Idaho Power located in the state of Wyoming, uses both surface and underground methods to mine coal to be used for power generation at the Jim Bridger power plant. The federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act and state laws and regulations establish operational, reclamation, bonding, and closure obligations and standards for mining of coal. BCC’s estimate of reclamation liability and bonding obligations is reviewed periodically by Idaho Power’s management committee, audit committee of the board of directors, external and internal auditors, and by government regulators. Idaho Power funds a trust and posts collateral in the form of a surety bond purchased jointly with the co-owner of BCC to cover such projected mine reclamation costs pursuant to the laws of the state of Wyoming. The trust funds are invested in debt and equity securities and poor performance of these investments would reduce the amount of funds available for their intended purpose, which could require Idaho Power to make additional cash contributions. If actual costs related to those 35Table of Contents                                      obligations exceed estimates, government regulations relating to those obligations change significantly or unexpected cash funding obligations are required, IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.As a holding company, IDACORP does not have its own operating income and must rely on the cash flows from its subsidiaries to pay dividends and make debt payments. IDACORP is a holding company with no significant operations of its own, and its primary assets are shares or other ownership interests of its subsidiaries, primarily Idaho Power. IDACORP’s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts to IDACORP, whether through dividends, loans, or other means. The ability of IDACORP’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to IDACORP depends on several factors, including each subsidiary's actual and projected earnings and cash flow, capital requirements and general financial condition, regulatory restrictions, tax obligations, covenants contained in credit facilities to which they are parties, and the prior rights of holders of their existing and future first mortgage bonds and other debt or equity securities. Further, the amount and payment of dividends is at the discretion of the board of directors, which may reduce or cease payment of dividends at any time. See Note 7 - ""Common Stock"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a further description of restrictions on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's payment of dividends"
2,IDA,IDACORP INC,2021-02-18,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS IDACORP and Idaho Power operate in a highly regulated industry and business environment that involves significant risks, many of which are beyond the companies' control. The circumstances and factors set forth below should not be considered a complete list of potential risks that the companies may encounter. These risk factors may have a material impact on the business, financial condition, or results of operations of IDACORP and Idaho Power and could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in any forward-looking statements. These risk factors, as well as other information in this report, including without limitation, in Part II - Item 7 - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Matters Impacting Future Results"" in this report, and information in other reports the companies file with the SEC, may be important to understanding any statement in this 2020 Annual Report or elsewhere and should be considered carefully when making any investment decisions relating to IDACORP or Idaho Power. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's businesses regularly face risks, many of which may cause future results to be different than anticipated as of the date of this report. Below are certain important utility-specific regulatory, operational, legal and compliance, financial and investment, and general business risks. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's reactions to material future developments as well as the utility industry's reactions to those developments may also impact the Companies' future results.Utility-Specific Regulatory RisksUtility-specific regulatory risk includes the risks that federal, state, or local regulators may impose additional requirements and costs on Idaho Power and the utility industry, reduce authorized rates of return or otherwise adversely affect recovery of costs and the opportunity to earn a return on investments, or require Idaho Power as a utility to make adverse changes to its business models, strategies, and practices. State or federal regulators may not approve customer rates that provide timely or sufficient recovery of Idaho Power's costs or allow Idaho Power to earn a reasonable rate of return, which could cause IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations to be adversely affected. The prices that the IPUC and OPUC authorize Idaho Power to charge customers for its retail services, and the tariff rate that the FERC permits Idaho Power to charge for its transmission services, are significant factors influencing IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s business, results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition. Idaho Power's ability to recover its costs and earn a reasonable rate of return can be affected by many regulatory factors, including the timing difference between when Idaho Power incurs costs and when Idaho Power recovers those costs in customers’ rates (often called ""regulatory lag"" in the utility industry), and differences between the costs included in rates and the amount of actual costs incurred. Idaho Power is often required to incur costs before the IPUC, OPUC, or FERC approves the recovery of those costs, such as construction costs for new facilities, changes in the long-term cost-effectiveness or changes to the operating conditions of Idaho Power's assets that could result in early retirements of utility facilities, the costs of compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements, increased funding levels of Idaho Power's defined benefit pension plan, and the costs of damage from fires, weather-related events, and natural disasters. The IPUC, OPUC, and FERC may not allow Idaho Power to recover some or all of those costs on the basis that they find Idaho Power did not reasonably or prudently incur those costs or for other reasons. The IPUC and OPUC may adopt different methods of calculating the allocation of the total utility costs in their respective jurisdictions, resulting in certain costs excluded in both states. Ratemaking has generally been premised on estimates of historic costs based on a test year, so if a given year’s actual costs are higher than historic costs, rates may not be sufficient to cover actual costs. While rate regulation is also premised on the assumption that rates established are fair, just, and reasonable, regulators have considerable discretion in applying this standard. Economic, political, legislative, public policy, or regulatory pressures may lead stakeholders to seek rate reductions or refunds, limits on rate increases, or lower allowed rates of return on investments for Idaho Power. The ratemaking process typically involves multiple intervening parties, including governmental bodies, consumer advocacy groups, and customers, generally with the common objective of limiting rate increases or even reducing rates. In the past, Idaho Power has been denied recovery, or required to defer recovery pending the next general rate case, including denials or deferrals related to capital expenditures for long-term project expenses. Adverse outcomes in regulatory proceedings, or significant regulatory lag, may cause Idaho Power to incur increased project costs or result in cancellation of projects, or to record an impairment of its assets or otherwise adversely affect cash flows and earnings. This may also result in lower credit ratings, reduced access to capital and higher financing costs, and reductions or delays in planned capital expenditures.For additional information relating to Idaho Power's state and federal regulatory framework and regulatory matters, see Part I - Item 1 - ""Business - Utility Operations,"" Part II - Item 7 - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Regulatory Matters,"" and Note 3 - ""Regulatory Matters"" to the consolidated financial statements of Part II - Item 8 in this report.22Table of Contents                          Idaho Power's regulatory cost recovery mechanisms may not function as intended and are subject to change or elimination, which may adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power has power cost adjustment mechanisms in its Idaho and Oregon jurisdictions and a fixed cost adjustment mechanism in Idaho. The power cost adjustment mechanisms track Idaho Power’s actual net power supply costs (primarily fuel and purchased power less wholesale energy sales) and compare these amounts to net power supply costs being recovered in retail rates. A majority of the differences between these two amounts is deferred for future recovery from, or refund to, customers through rates. Volatility in power supply costs continues to be significant, in large part due to fluctuations in hydropower generation conditions and high costs for the purchase of renewable energy under mandatory long-term contracts. While the power cost adjustment mechanisms function to mitigate the potentially adverse impact on net income of power supply cost volatility, the mechanisms do not eliminate the cash flow impact of that volatility. When power costs rise above the level recovered in current retail rates, Idaho Power incurs the costs but recovery of those costs is deferred to a subsequent collection period, which can adversely affect Idaho Power’s operating cash flow and liquidity until those costs are recovered from customers. The fixed cost adjustment mechanism is a decoupling mechanism that allows Idaho Power to charge Idaho residential and small commercial customers when it recovers less than the base level of fixed costs per customer that the IPUC authorized for recovery in the most recent general rate case. The power cost and fixed cost adjustment mechanisms are generally subject to change at the discretion of applicable state regulators, who could decide to modify or eliminate either mechanism in a manner that adversely impacts IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. The COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak could adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's business functions, financial condition, and results of operations. The COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak has resulted in widespread impacts on the global economy and on Idaho Power's employees, customers, contractors, and suppliers, and there is considerable uncertainty regarding the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. Authorities have implemented various measures to reduce the spread of the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, and other restrictive orders and mandates (including those in effect in Idaho Power's service area in the states of Idaho and Oregon), as well as business and government shutdowns. While governmental authorities have eased some restrictions and vaccines are becoming available, it is possible that an increase in COVID-19 cases could prompt a return to tighter restrictions in some or all of the states and countries in which Idaho Power and its contractors and suppliers operate. Restrictions of this nature are difficult to predict and may cause Idaho Power or its contractors to miss milestones on construction projects and experience operational delays, delay the delivery of electrical infrastructure and other supplies that it sources from around the globe, delay the connection of electric service to new customers, prolong the time period necessary to perform maintenance of our infrastructure, and significantly reduce the use of electricity by commercial and industrial customers.Further, while Idaho Power has modified certain business and workforce practices (including employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events, and conferences) to conform to government restrictions and best practices encouraged by government and regulatory authorities, Idaho Power has a limited number of highly skilled operators for some of its critical power plants and its grid operations centers. If a large proportion of Idaho Power's employees in those critical facilities, however, were to contract COVID-19 at the same time, Idaho Power would rely upon its business continuity plans in an effort to continue operations at those facilities. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the adverse impact to its operations.Additionally, the uncertainty around and impacts of COVID-19 on IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s business operations and access to capital, on their customers, and on the utility industry and economy as a whole, could adversely impact IDACORP’s common stock price, financial condition, and business operations. For example, the costs related to Idaho Power's noncontributory defined benefit pension plan, as well as a defined benefit postretirement benefit plan (consisting of health care and death benefits) that covers eligible retirees, are based in part on the value of the plans’ assets and, therefore, adverse investment performance for these assets or the failure to maintain sustained growth in pension investments over time could increase its plan costs and funding requirements related to the plans. Similarly, IDACORP and Idaho Power rely on access to the capital markets to fund capital requirements. To the extent that access to the capital markets is adversely affected by COVID-19, IDACORP and Idaho Power may need to consider alternative sources of funding, such as existing or additional credit facilities, for its operations and for working capital, which may increase its cost of, as well as adversely impact its access to, capital. Increased volatility or significant disruptions in the global financial markets due to COVID-19 could impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's ability to comply with debt covenants. These uncertain economic conditions may also result in the inability of Idaho Power's customers to pay for electric service, which could affect the collectability of its revenues and adversely affect its financial results.The degree to which COVID-19 may impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations is unknown at this time and will depend on future developments, including the continuing spread of the virus, the 23Table of Contents                         severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, the deployment rate of the vaccines, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can and will resume.Operational RisksOperational risk relates to risks arising from the systems, assets, processes, people, and external factors that affect the operation of IDACORP's or Idaho Power's businesses.Changes in customer growth and customer usage may negatively affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's business, financial condition, and results of operations. Changes in the number of customers and customers' use of electricity are affected by a number of factors, such as population growth or decline in Idaho Power's service area, expansion or loss of service area, changes in customer needs and expectations, adoption rates of energy efficiency measures, customer-generated power such as from solar panels and gas-fired generators, demand-side management requirements, regulation or deregulation, and adverse economic conditions. An economic downturn or recession, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, could also negatively impact customer use and reduce revenues and cash flows, thus adversely affecting results of operations. Many electric utilities, including Idaho Power, have experienced a decline in usage per customer, in part attributable to energy efficiency activities. State or federal regulations may be enacted to encourage or require mandatory energy conservation or technological advances that increase energy efficiency, which could further reduce usage per customer. Also, changing customer needs and expectations and increased competition from customer-owned generation could lead to lower customer satisfaction, reduced loyalty, difficulty in obtaining rate increases, legislation to deregulate electric service, and customers seeking alternative sources of energy and electric service. If customers choose to generate their own energy, discontinue a portion or all service from Idaho Power, or replace electric power for heating with natural gas, demand for Idaho Power's energy may decline and adversely impact the affordability of its services for remaining customers. While Idaho Power has recently experienced a net growth in usage due to an increase in the number of customers, when adjusted for the impacts of weather, the average monthly usage on a per customer basis for Idaho Power's residential customers has declined from 1,035 kWh in 2011 to 947 kWh in 2020. Rate mechanisms, such as the Idaho fixed cost adjustment for residential and small commercial customers, are designed to address the financial disincentive associated with promoting energy efficiency activities, but there is no assurance that the mechanism will result in full or timely collection of Idaho Power's fixed costs, which are currently collected in large part through the company's volume-based energy rates that are based on historical sales volume. Any undercollection of fixed costs would adversely impact revenues, earnings, and cash flows. The formation of municipal utilities or similar entities for distribution systems within Idaho Power's service area could also result in a load decrease. The loss of loads resulting from some of these events may result in excess infrastructure and stranded costs and require IDACORP and Idaho Power to modify or eliminate large generation or transmission projects. This could in turn result in reduced revenues as well as write-downs or write-offs if regulators determine that the costs of the projects were incurred imprudently, which could have a material adverse impact on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Conversely, if Idaho Power were to experience an unanticipated increase in the demand for energy through, for example, the rapid addition of new industrial and commercial customers or population growth in the service area, Idaho Power may be required to rely on higher-cost purchased power to meet peak system demand and may need to accelerate investment in additional generation or transmission resources. If the incremental costs associated with the unanticipated changes in loads exceed the incremental revenue received from the sales to the new customers, and Idaho Power is unable to secure timely and full rate relief to recover those increased costs, the resulting imbalance could have an adverse effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.Changes in weather conditions, severe weather, and the impacts of climate change can adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's operating results and cause them to fluctuate seasonally. Idaho Power's electric power sales are seasonal, with demand in Idaho Power's service area peaking during the hot summer months, with a secondary peak during the cold winter months. Electric power demands by irrigation customers in Idaho Power's service area, which are impacted by temperatures and the timing and amount of precipitation, can also create significant seasonal changes in usage. Seasonality of revenues may be further impacted by Idaho Power's tiered rate structure, under which rates charged to customers are often higher during higher-load periods, such as hot summers and cold winters. Market prices for power also often increase significantly during these peak periods, at times when Idaho Power is required to purchase power in the wholesale markets to meet customer demand. While Idaho Power has regulatory mechanisms to help mitigate the impact of weather on power supply costs, there is no assurance that it will continue to receive such regulatory protection in the future. By contrast, when temperatures are relatively mild or where precipitation supplants irrigation systems, loads are often lower as customers are not using electricity for heating and air conditioning or irrigation purposes. Thus, weather conditions and the timing and extent of precipitation can cause IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition to fluctuate seasonally, quarterly, and from year to year. 24Table of Contents                         Climate change could also have significant physical effects in Idaho Power’s service area, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, lightning, droughts, heat waves, fires, floods, snow loading, and other extreme weather events. These extreme weather events and their associated impacts could damage transmission, distribution, and generation facilities, causing service interruptions and extended or mass outages, increasing costs and other operating and maintenance expenses, including emergency response planning and preparedness expenses, and limiting Idaho Power's ability to meet customer energy demand. Sustained drought conditions or decreased snow pack due to reduced precipitation or higher temperatures are likely to decrease power generation from hydropower plants. Idaho Power's customers' energy needs vary with weather and to the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, customers' energy use could increase or decrease. Increased energy use due to weather changes may require Idaho Power to invest in generating assets and transmission and distribution infrastructure, while decreased energy use due to weather changes may result in decreased revenues. Extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand may raise wholesale electricity prices for power that Idaho Power purchases to serve customers, increasing the cost of energy Idaho Power provides to its customers, and at the same time can increase the revenues Idaho Power receives for wholesale market sales of excess generation during regional extreme weather events. Variations in hydropower generation that increase Idaho Power's reliance on market purchases may lead to more costly power supply sources for its customers and reduce benefits from selling surplus hydropower in the wholesale market. The price of power in the wholesale energy markets tends to be higher during periods of high regional demand that tends to occur with weather extremes, which may cause Idaho Power to purchase power in the wholesale market during peak price periods, increasing power supply costs. Idaho Power has in place mechanisms to help mitigate the effects of  energy market price volatility, but there is no assurance these mechanisms will continue to be in place or function as intended.The costs of repairing and replacing infrastructure or liability for personal injury, loss of life, and property damage from utility equipment that fails, including as a result of significant weather and weather-related events and fires, may not be covered in full by insurance. Costs incurred in connection with such events might also not be recovered through customer rates if the costs incurred are greater than those allowed for recovery by regulators. In addition, state and federal legislation and regulations have been proposed in recent years and may be implemented in the future, including in the State of Oregon and by the EPA under the new Presidential Administration. These laws are intended to limit the severity and impact of climate change, such as imposing mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, which could increase Idaho Power’s power supply and compliance costs or require generation facilities to be retired early, resulting in potential stranded costs and write-downs or write-offs if Idaho Power is unable to fully recover investments in such facilities. If financial markets increasingly view climate change or greenhouse gas emissions as a financial or investment risk for electric utilities, it could negatively affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's ability to access debt and equity capital markets on favorable terms. For additional information relating to legislation, regulations, and legal proceedings related to environmental matters, see Part II - Item 7 - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Matters"" in this report.New advances in power generation, energy efficiency, alternative energy sources, or other technologies that impact the power utility industry could decrease customer energy demand and revenues. Advances in technology and changes in customer demand and preferences in the electric utility industry have encouraged the development of new technologies for power generation, energy storage, and energy efficiency. In particular, in recent years the net cost of solar generation and storage technology has decreased significantly, and there are federal and state regulations, laws, and other incentives in place to help further reduce the net cost of solar facilities. There is potential that customer-owned solar power generation systems, particularly if coupled with energy storage devices, could become sufficiently cost-effective and efficient that an increasing number of Idaho Power's customers choose to install such systems on their homes or businesses, which in turn could require changes in the way Idaho Power builds and manages its distribution systems, and reduce the demand for and sale of energy. Additionally, considerable emphasis has been placed on energy efficiency, such as LED lighting and high-efficiency appliances. Energy efficiency programs, including programs sponsored by Idaho Power under a directive from state regulatory commissions, are designed to reduce energy use and demand. The introduction of new technologies could pose risks in the form of reduced sales and new business models for energy services. Advances in technology that reduce the costs of alternative methods of producing electric energy could result in loss of revenue and customers. These changes in technology could also alter the channels through which customers buy or utilize energy, which could reduce Idaho Power's revenues or impact Idaho Power's expenses. A reduction in load, however, would not necessarily reduce Idaho Power's need for ongoing investments in its infrastructure to reliably serve its customers. If Idaho Power is unable to adjust its rate design or maintain adequate regulatory mechanisms allowing for timely cost recovery, declining usage from customer-owned generation sources and energy efficiency would result in under-recovery of Idaho Power's costs and investment in infrastructure, and reduce revenues, which would impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.25Table of Contents                          Acts or threats of terrorism, acts of war, social unrest, cyber attacks, data or physical security breaches, and other acts of individuals or groups seeking to disrupt Idaho Power's operations or the electric power grid could require significant expenditures, or result in claims against the companies, and negatively impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power operates in an industry that requires the continuous use and operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. Idaho Power's generation and transmission facilities and its grid operations are potential targets for terrorist acts and threats, acts of war, social unrest, cyber attacks, and other disruptive activities of individuals or groups, including by nation states or nation state-sponsored groups. Federal regulators have stated that the number of organizations seeking opportunities to exploit potential vulnerabilities in the United States energy infrastructure is increasing and that those attacks have become increasingly frequent and sophisticated. Some of Idaho Power's facilities are deemed ""critical infrastructure,"" in that incapacity or destruction of the facilities could have a debilitating impact on security, reliability or operability of the bulk electric power system, national economic security, and public health and safety. The possibility that infrastructure facilities, such as generation facilities and electric transmission or distribution facilities, would be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror or cyber attack, including by nation states or nation state-sponsored groups (whether originating internally or externally), may affect Idaho Power's operations by limiting the ability to generate, purchase, or transmit power. Idaho Power's electric transmission systems are part of an interconnected regional grid, and therefore, it faces the risk of causing or being subject to a blackout due to grid disturbances or disruptions on a neighboring interconnected system. Cyber threats and attacks can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across networks, information systems, and other technologies. Network, information systems, and technology-related events, including those caused by IDACORP or Idaho Power, such as process breakdowns, human error, security architecture or design vulnerabilities, or by third parties, such as computer hackings, cyber attacks, computer viruses, or other destructive or disruptive software, denial of service attacks, social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing, could result in a degradation or disruption in the energy grid and the services of the companies, as well as the ability to record, process, and report customer, business, and financial information. Physical or cyber attacks against key suppliers or service providers could have a similar effect on IDACORP and Idaho Power. Terrorist attacks, acts of war, social unrest, cyber attacks, and similar incidents can create political, economic, social, or financial market instability, and can cause damage to or interference with Idaho Power’s operating assets, customers, or suppliers. This may result in business interruption, lost revenue, higher commodity prices, disruption in fuel supplies, lower energy consumption, and unstable markets, particularly with respect to electricity and natural gas, and increased security, repair, or other costs, any of which may materially adversely affect Idaho Power in ways that cannot be predicted as of the date of this report. Any of these risks could materially affect the companies’ consolidated financial results. These events, and governmental actions in response, could result in a material decrease in revenues and increase costs to protect, repair, and insure Idaho Power's assets and operate its business.  Idaho Power's operations require the continuous availability of information technology systems and network infrastructure, and in the normal course of business, Idaho Power or its vendors collect and store sensitive and confidential customer and employee information and proprietary information of Idaho Power. Idaho Power’s technology systems are dependent upon connectivity to the internet and third party vendors to host, maintain, modify, and update its systems, which  may experience significant system failures or cyber attacks that could compromise the security of Idaho Power’s assets and information. During 2020 and into 2021, for example, a sophisticated security breach of a software platform used broadly across industry sectors, including the utility industry and many of the industry’s vendors, created a cyber security vulnerability for thousands of companies in the United States as well as a number of governmental entities. Any data security breaches, such as misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in IDACORP's and Idaho Power's information technology systems, including customer data, could result in violations of privacy and other laws, financial loss to Idaho Power or to its customers, customer dissatisfaction or diminished customer confidence, damage to Idaho Power’s reputation, and significant litigation and penalty exposure, all of which could materially affect Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. No security measures can completely shield Idaho Power's systems, infrastructure, and data from vulnerabilities to cyber attacks, human error, intrusions, or other catastrophic events that could result in their failure or reduced functionality, and ultimately the potential loss of sensitive information or the loss of Idaho Power's ability to fulfill critical business functions and provide reliable electric power to customers. Idaho Power maintains insurance related to these events; however, such insurance is subject to exclusions, and may be insufficient in amount to offset any losses, costs, or damage experienced, particularly given the potential significant magnitude of a security incident like those reported broadly in the media, and further, any such insurance may become unreasonably expensive or unavailable in the future.Changes in capital expenditures for infrastructure and the risks associated with permitting and construction of utility infrastructure can significantly affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power’s business is capital intensive and requires significant investments in energy generation, transmission, and distribution 26Table of Contents                         infrastructure. A significant portion of Idaho Power’s facilities were constructed many years ago, and thus require periodic upgrades and frequent maintenance. Also, long-term anticipated increases in both the number of customers and the demand for energy require expansion and reinforcement of that infrastructure. For instance, Idaho Power is in the permitting process for two high-voltage transmission line projects, which are intended to help meet future customer energy demands. Construction projects are subject to usual permitting and construction risks that can adversely affect project costs and the completion time. These risks include, as examples:•the ability to timely obtain labor or materials at reasonable costs;•defaults by suppliers and contractors; •equipment, engineering, and design failures; •unexpected environmental and geological problems;•the effects of adverse weather conditions; •catastrophic events and natural disasters;•availability of financing; •load forecasts;•the ability to obtain approval from local, state, or federal regulatory and governmental bodies and to comply with permits and land use rights, and environmental constraints; and•delays and costs associated with disputes and litigation with third parties or stakeholder activism. The occurrence of any of these risks could cause Idaho Power to operate at reduced capacity levels, which in turn could reduce revenues, increase expenses, or cause Idaho Power to incur penalties. If Idaho Power is unable to complete the permitting or construction of a project, or incurs costs that regulators do not deem prudent, it may be unable to recover its costs in full through rates or on a timely basis. Further, if Idaho Power is unable to secure permits or joint funding commitments to develop transmission infrastructure necessary to serve loads or if other resources become more economical, it may terminate those projects and, as alternatives, seek to develop additional generation facilities within areas where Idaho Power has available transmission capacity or pursue other more costly options to serve loads. To limit the timing-related risks of these projects, Idaho Power may enter into purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals or permits. If any of the projects are canceled for any reason, including Idaho Power's failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals or permits or because the project is no longer economical, Idaho Power could incur significant cancellation penalties under purchase orders or construction contracts. Additionally, termination of a project carries with it the potential for impairment of the associated asset if regulators deny full recovery of project costs. Thus, termination of a project could negatively affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.Factors contributing to lower hydropower generation can increase costs and negatively impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power derives a significant portion of its power supply from its hydropower facilities. During 2019 and 2020, 62 percent and 54 percent, respectively, of Idaho Power's electric power from Idaho Power-owned generation was from hydropower facilities. Due to Idaho Power’s heavy reliance on hydropower generation, the impacts of climate change and factors such as precipitation and snowpack, the timing of run-off, and the availability of water in the Snake River basin can significantly affect its operations. The combination of a long-term trend of declining Snake River base flows, over-appropriation of water, and periods of drought have led to water rights disputes and proceedings among surface water and ground water irrigators and the State of Idaho. Recharging the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer by diverting surface water to porous locations and permitting it to sink into the aquifer is one approach to the over-appropriation dispute. Diversions from the Snake River for aquifer recharge or the loss of water rights reduce Snake River flows available for hydropower generation. When hydropower generation is reduced, Idaho Power must increase its use of more expensive thermal generating resources and market power purchases; therefore, costs increase and opportunities for wholesale energy sales are reduced, reducing revenues and potentially earnings. Through its power cost adjustment mechanisms, Idaho Power expects to recover most (but not all) of the increase in net power supply costs caused by lower hydropower generation. The timing of recovery of the increased costs, however, may not occur until the subsequent power cost adjustment year, adversely affecting cash flows and liquidity.Idaho Power’s use of coal and natural gas to fuel power generation facilities exposes it to commodity availability and price risk, which can adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition. As part of its normal business operations, Idaho Power purchases coal and natural gas in the open market or under short-term or long-term contracts, often with variable pricing terms. Market prices for coal and natural gas are volatile and influenced by factors impacting supply and demand such as weather conditions, the adequacy and type of generating capacity, fuel transportation availability, economic conditions, regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions, changes in technology, moratoriums on federally leased coal, and increases in coal lease costs. Natural gas transportation to Idaho Power's three natural gas plants is 27Table of Contents                         limited to one primary pipeline, presenting a heightened possibility of supply constraint and disruptions separate from the risk of counterparty default. Most of Idaho Power's coal supply arrangements are under long-term contracts for coal originating in Wyoming, and thus Idaho Power is exposed to risk of disruption of coal production in, or transportation from, that region. Idaho Power may from time to time enter into new, or renegotiate, these long-term contracts but can provide no assurance that such contracts will be negotiated or renegotiated on satisfactory terms, or at all. There also can be no assurance that counterparties to the natural gas or coal supply agreements will fulfill their obligations to supply natural gas or coal, and they may experience regulatory, financial, or technical problems or unforeseeable events that inhibit their ability to deliver natural gas or coal. Disruptions in transportation of fuel and defaults by coal and natural gas suppliers may cause Idaho Power to seek alternative, and potentially more costly, sources of fuel or rely on other generation sources or wholesale market power purchases. Idaho Power's failure to provide service due to such disruptions may also result in fines, penalties, or cost disallowances through the regulatory process. Idaho Power may not be able to fully or timely recover these increased costs through rates and power cost adjustment mechanisms, which may adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power’s generation, transmission, and distribution facilities are subject to numerous operational risks unique to it and its industry, including circumstances causing power outages, injuries and property damage, loss of life, and fires. Operating risks associated with Idaho Power's generation, transmission, and distribution facilities include equipment failures, volatility in fuel and transportation pricing, interruptions in fuel supplies, increased regulatory compliance costs, labor disputes or attrition, accidents and workforce safety matters, environmental damage, property damage, wildfires, acts of terrorism or sabotage (both cyber and asset-based), the loss of cost-effective disposal options for solid waste such as coal ash, operator error, and the occurrence of catastrophic events at the facilities. Diminished availability or performance of those facilities could result in reduced customer satisfaction, reputational harm, liability to third parties (including tort liability), and regulatory inquiries and fines. Operation of Idaho Power's owned and co-owned generating stations below expected capacity levels, or unplanned outages at these stations, could cause reduced energy output and lower efficiency levels and result in lost revenues and increased expenses for alternative fuels or wholesale market power purchases. Further, during high-load periods the transmission system in Idaho Power's service area is constrained, limiting the ability to transmit electric energy within the service area and access electric energy from outside the service area. Idaho Power's transmission facilities are also interconnected with those of third parties, and thus operation of Idaho Power's and third-parties' facilities could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events. These transmission constraints and events could result in failure to provide reliable service to customers and the inability to deliver energy from generating facilities to the power grid, and the inability to access lower cost sources of electric energy. Idaho Power also enters into agreements with third-party contractors to perform work on its generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, and may in some circumstances retain liability for the quality and completion of those contractors’ work, potentially subjecting Idaho Power to penalties, liability for personal injury, loss of life, or property damage, reputational harm, or enforcement actions or liability if a contractor violates applicable laws, rules, regulations, or orders.Accidents, terrorist acts, electrical contacts, fires, explosions, catastrophic failures, general system damage or dysfunction, uncontrolled release of water from hydropower dams, and other unplanned events related to Idaho Power's infrastructure would increase repair costs and may expose Idaho Power to liability for personal injury, loss of life, and property damage. Fires alleged to have been caused by Idaho Power's transmission, distribution, or generation infrastructure, or that allegedly result from Idaho Power’s or its contractors’ operating or maintenance practices, could also expose Idaho Power to claims for fire suppression and clean-up costs, evacuation costs, fines and penalties, and liability for economic damages, personal injury, loss of life, property damage, and environmental pollution, whether based on claims of negligence, trespass, or otherwise. The risk of wildfires is exacerbated in forested areas where beetle infestations have caused a significant increase in the quantity of standing dead and dying timber, increasing the risk that such trees may fall from either inside or outside our right-of-way into a powerline igniting a fire and increasing the magnitude of fires. A significant number of urban-wildland interfaces in and near Idaho Power's service area, and commonly hot, dry summer conditions that may worsen as a result of climate change, increase the likelihood and magnitude of damages that may be caused by fires burning into or allegedly originating from utility equipment. Further, there has been an increasing trend in the degree of annual destruction from wildfires in the western United States. Idaho Power maintains insurance coverage for such operating and event risks, but insurance coverage is subject to the terms and limitations of the available policies and may not be sufficient in amount to cover Idaho Power’s ultimate liability. Coverage limits within wildfire insurance policies could result in material self-insured costs in the event there are fires that are deemed to be separate occurrences covered by self-insured retention amounts under the terms of Idaho Power’s insurance policies. Idaho Power or its contractors and customers could also experience coverage reductions and increased wildfire insurance costs in future years. Idaho Power may be unable to fully recover costs in excess of insurance through customer rates or regulatory mechanisms and, even if such recovery is possible, it could take several years to collect. If the amount of insurance is insufficient or otherwise unavailable, and if Idaho Power is unable to fully recover in rates the costs of uninsured losses, IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially affected.28Table of Contents                         Purchases of power from renewable energy projects, and integration of power generated from those projects into Idaho Power's system, may increase costs and decrease system reliability, and adversely affect Idaho Power's and IDACORP's results of operations and financial condition. An abundance of intermittent, non-dispatchable generation from renewable energy projects interconnected with Idaho Power's system has had an impact on the operation of Idaho Power's generation plants, system reliability, power supply costs, and the wholesale power markets. Idaho Power is generally obligated under federal law to purchase power from certain renewable energy projects, regardless of the then-current load demand, availability of lower cost generation resources, or wholesale energy market prices. As of December 31, 2020, Idaho Power had federally-mandated contracts to purchase energy from 128 on-line projects with third parties. This increases the likelihood and frequency that Idaho Power will be required to reduce output from its lower-cost hydropower and fossil fuel-fired generation resources, which in turn increases power purchase costs and customer rates and impacts Idaho Power's ability to invest in additional generation and earn a reasonable return on rate base in the future. Further, balancing load and generation from Idaho Power's power generation portfolio is challenging, and Idaho Power expects that its operational and infrastructure costs will continue to increase as a result of its efforts to integrate intermittent, non-dispatchable generation from a large number of renewable energy projects. If Idaho Power is unable to timely recover those costs through its rates, power cost adjustment mechanisms, or otherwise, those increased costs may negatively affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's activities are concentrated in one industry and in one region, which exposes it to risks from lack of diversification, regional economic conditions, and regional legislation and regulation. IDACORP and Idaho Power do not have diversified operations or sources of revenue. Idaho Power comprises the bulk of IDACORP's operations, and Idaho Power's business is concentrated solely in the electricity industry. Furthermore, Idaho Power's provision of electric service to retail customers is conducted exclusively in its southern Idaho and eastern Oregon service area. As a result, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's future performance, revenues, and collectability of revenues, as well as expenses, will be affected by regional economic conditions, regulatory and legislative activity, weather conditions, and other events and conditions in its service area and in the electric power industry.  The impacts of a retiring workforce with specialized utility-specific functions and the inability to hire qualified third-party vendors could increase costs and adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power’s operations require a skilled workforce to perform specialized utility functions. Many of these positions, such as linemen, grid operators, engineering and design personnel, and generation plant operators, require extensive, specialized training. Idaho Power has experienced in recent years an above-average number of employee retirements and expects the increased level of retirement of its skilled workforce and persons in key positions will continue in 2021 and in the near-term. At December 31, 2020, approximately 21 percent of Idaho Power's employees were eligible for regular or early retirement under Idaho Power's defined benefit pension plan. This will require Idaho Power to attract, train, and retain new employees to help prevent a loss of institutional knowledge and avoid a skills gap. Idaho Power does not have employment contracts with its officers or key employees and cannot guarantee that any member of its management or any key employee at the IDACORP parent or any subsidiary level will continue to serve in any capacity for any particular period of time. The loss of skills and institutional knowledge of experienced employees, the failure to foster an inclusive, equitable, and diverse environment in order to hire appropriately qualified employees, the costs associated with attracting, training, and retaining such employees to replace an aging and skilled workforce, and the operational and financial costs of unionization or the attempt to unionize all or part of the companies’ workforce, could have a negative effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power could incur increased costs due to such turnover due to a loss of knowledge, errors due to inexperienced employees or substantial training time, loss of productivity, and increased safety compliance issues.Idaho Power also hires third-party vendors to assist in performing a variety of ordinary business functions, such as power plant maintenance, data warehousing and management, software development and licensing, electric transmission and distribution operations, billing and metering processes, and vegetation management, among other things. In recent years, Idaho Power has experienced increased competition and rising prices for many forms of third-party vendor services. While Idaho Power does not rely entirely on third-party vendors for many of these business functions, the unavailability of such vendors could adversely affect the quality and cost of Idaho Power's electric service and negatively impact its results of operation.Legal and Compliance RisksLegal and compliance risk relates to risks arising from government and regulatory action and from legal proceedings and compliance with applicable laws, rules, orders, regulations, policies, and procedures, including those related to financial reporting, environmental, health, and safety, and potential changes in legal requirements.29Table of Contents                         Changes in legislation, regulation, and government policy may have a material adverse effect on IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s business in the future. Specific legislative and regulatory proposals and recently enacted legislation that could have a material impact on IDACORP and Idaho Power include, but are not limited to, tax reform, utility regulation, carbon-reduction initiatives, infrastructure renewal programs, environmental regulation, and modifications to accounting and public company reporting requirements. Further, the proposals and new legislation could have an impact on the rate of growth of Idaho Power’s customers and their willingness to expand operations and increase electric service requirements. Due to the new Presidential Administration, Idaho Power expects laws, regulations, and policies relating to environmental compliance to change and require IDACORP and Idaho Power and some of their customers to modify their business strategy or restrict activities and projects, potentially subjecting them to increased compliance costs. For example, in January 2021, the United States rejoined the Paris Agreement on climate change that requires commitments related to greenhouse gas emissions, among other things, and the new Presidential Administration has announced ambitious clean energy initiatives. Many states and localities may continue to pursue climate policies in addition to federal mandates. The state of Oregon, for instance, has been pursuing cap-and-trade legislation for greenhouse gas emissions. Idaho Power could also become subject to climate change lawsuits and an adverse outcome could require substantial expenditures and could possibly require payment of damages. IDACORP and Idaho Power expect federal, state, and local governmental authorities to implement various recent and expected future executive orders from the new Presidential Administration and are unable to predict whether and to what extent such actions will meaningfully change existing legislative and regulatory environments relevant to the companies, or if any such changes would have a net positive or negative impact on the companies. To the extent that such changes have a negative impact on the companies or Idaho Power’s customers, including as a result of related uncertainty, these changes may materially and adversely impact IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.Changes in income tax laws and regulations, or differing interpretation or enforcement of applicable laws by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdictions, could have a material adverse impact on IDACORP’s or Idaho Power’s financial condition and results of operations. IDACORP and Idaho Power must make judgments and interpretations about the application of the law when determining the provision for income taxes. Amounts of income tax-related assets and liabilities involve judgments and estimates of the timing and probability of recognition of income, deductions, and tax credits, which are subject to challenge by taxing authorities. These judgments may include estimates for potential outcomes regarding tax positions that may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities. Disputes over interpretations of tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority in examination, upon appeal, or through litigation. In recent years, state regulatory mechanisms with income tax-related provisions (such as Idaho Power's May 2018 Idaho tax reform settlement stipulation with the IPUC), have significantly impacted IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations. Due to the new Presidential Administration, IDACORP and Idaho Power expect tax reform legislation could be enacted that may increase the companies' federal and state tax rates and reporting obligations. The outcome of potential future income tax proceedings or laws, or the state public utility commissions' treatment of those outcomes, could differ materially from the amounts IDACORP and Idaho Power record prior to conclusion of those proceedings, and the difference could negatively affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s earnings and cash flows. Further, in some instances, the treatment from a ratemaking perspective of any net income tax expense (including from increased tax rates) or benefit could be different than IDACORP or Idaho Power anticipate or request from applicable state regulatory commissions, which could have a negative effect on their financial condition and results of operations. In addition, Idaho Power uses the regulatory flow-through income tax accounting method as described in Note 1 - ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report, and potential changes in income tax laws or interpretations may impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's income taxes and reporting obligations differently than most other companies.IDACORP's and Idaho Power’s businesses are subject to an extensive set of environmental laws, rules, and regulations, which could impact their operations and costs of operations, potentially rendering some generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate, and could increase the costs and alter the timing of major projects. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's operations are subject to a number of federal, state, and local environmental statutes, rules, and regulations relating to air and water quality, natural resources, renewable energy, and health and safety. Many of these laws and regulations are described in Part II - Item 7 - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Matters"" in this report. These laws and regulations generally require IDACORP and Idaho Power to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, and other approvals, including through substantial investment in pollution controls, and may be enforced by both public officials and private individuals. Some of these regulations are pending, changing, or subject to interpretation, and failure to comply may result in penalties, mandatory operational changes, and other adverse consequences, including costs associated with defending against claims by governmental authorities or private parties and complying with new operating requirements. Idaho Power devotes significant resources to environmental monitoring, pollution control equipment, and mitigation projects to comply with existing and anticipated environmental regulations. However, it is possible that federal, state and local authorities could attempt to enforce more stringent standards, stricter regulation, and more expansive application of environmental regulations. 30Table of Contents                         Environmental regulations have created the need for Idaho Power to install new pollution control equipment at, and may cause Idaho Power to perform environmental remediation on, its owned and co-owned power generation facilities, often at a substantial cost. Compliance with environmental regulations can significantly increase capital spending, operating costs, and plant outages, and can negatively affect the affordability of Idaho Power's services for customers. Idaho Power cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures necessary to comply with these environmental laws and regulations, although Idaho Power expects the expenditures will be substantial. In some cases, the costs to obtain permits and ensure facilities are in compliance may be prohibitively expensive. If the costs of compliance with new regulations renders the generating facilities uneconomical to maintain or operate, Idaho Power would need to identify alternative resources for power, potentially in the form of new generation and transmission facilities, market power purchases, demand-side management programs, or a combination of these and other methods. Furthermore, Idaho Power may not be able to obtain or maintain all environmental regulatory approvals necessary for operation of its existing infrastructure or construction of new infrastructure.  In response to state and federal regulatory requirements, judicial decisions and international accords, emissions of greenhouse gases including, most significantly CO2 could be restricted in the future. If new emissions reduction rules were to become effective, they could result in significant additional compliance costs that would affect Idaho Power's future financial position, results of operations, and cash flows if such costs are not timely recovered through regulated rates. Moreover, the possibility exists that stricter laws, regulations, or enforcement policies could significantly increase compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary. In addition, some environmental regulations are currently subject to litigation and not yet final. As a result of this uncertainty, approaches to comply with the regulations, including available control technologies or other allowed compliance measures, are unpredictable and Idaho Power cannot foresee the potential impacts these regulations would have on Idaho Power's operations or financial condition. In 2019, Idaho Power also announced its commitment to serve customers with 100 percent clean energy by 2045, which could impact infrastructure resource decisions and costs. Idaho Power is not guaranteed timely or full recovery through customer rates or insurance of costs associated with environmental regulations, environmental compliance, its clean energy initiatives, plant closures, or clean-up of contamination. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if Idaho Power fails to obtain, maintain, or comply with any such approval, construction and/or operation of Idaho Power's generation or transmission facilities could be delayed, halted, or subjected to additional costs. For further discussion of environmental matters that may affect Idaho Power, see ""Environmental Matters"" in ""Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in this report.Obligations imposed in connection with hydropower license renewals may require large capital expenditures, increase operating costs, reduce hydropower generation, and negatively affect IDACORP's or Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition. For the last several years, Idaho Power has been engaged in an effort to renew its federal license for its largest hydropower generation source, the Hells Canyon Complex. Relicensing includes an extensive public review process that involves numerous natural resource issues and environmental conditions. The existence of endangered and threatened species in the watershed may result in major operational changes to the region’s hydropower projects, which may be reflected in hydropower licenses, including for the Hells Canyon Complex and the American Falls facility. In addition, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to hydropower facilities, which could further increase required expenditures for marine life recovery and endangered species protection and reduce the amount of hydropower generation available to meet Idaho Power’s generation requirements. Idaho Power cannot predict the requirements that might be imposed during the relicensing process, the financial impact of those requirements, whether a new multi-year license will ultimately be issued, and whether the IPUC or OPUC will allow recovery through rates of the substantial costs incurred in connection with the licensing process and subsequent compliance. Imposition of onerous conditions in the relicensing process could result in Idaho Power incurring significant capital expenditures, increase operating costs (including power purchase costs), and reduce hydropower generation, which could negatively affect results of operations and financial condition.Idaho Power could be subject to penalties, reputational harm, and operational changes if it violates mandatory reliability and security requirements, which could adversely impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition. As an owner and operator of a bulk power transmission system, Idaho Power is subject to mandatory reliability and security standards issued by the FERC and other regulators. The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability, security, and market interface principles. Compliance with reliability standards subjects Idaho Power to higher operating costs and increased capital expenditures. Idaho Power has received in recent years notices of violations from, and regularly self-reports reliability standard compliance issues to, the FERC, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and the Western Electricity Coordinating Council. Potential monetary and non-monetary penalties for a violation of FERC regulations may be substantial, and in some circumstances monetary penalties may exceed $1.3 million per day per violation. As a utility with a large customer base, Idaho Power is 31Table of Contents                         subject to adverse publicity focused on the reliability of its services and the speed with which it is able to respond to electric outages caused by storm damage or other unanticipated events. Adverse publicity could harm the reputations of IDACORP and Idaho Power; may make state legislatures, utility commissions, and other regulatory authorities less likely to view the companies in a favorable light; and may cause Idaho Power to be subject to less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes or increased regulatory oversight. The imposition of any of the foregoing on Idaho Power for its actual or alleged failure to comply with reliability and security requirements could also have a negative effect on its and IDACORP’s results of operations and financial condition.IDACORP and Idaho Power are subject to costs and other effects of legal and regulatory proceedings, disputes, and claims. From time to time in the normal course of business, IDACORP and Idaho Power are subject to various lawsuits, regulatory proceedings, disputes, and claims that could result in adverse judgments or settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, or other adverse consequences. These matters are subject to a number of uncertainties, and management is often unable to predict the outcome of such matters; resulting liabilities could exceed amounts currently reserved or insured against with respect to such matter. The legal costs and final resolution of matters in which IDACORP or Idaho Power are involved could have reputational impact and a short- or long-term negative effect on their financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, the terms of resolution could require the companies to change their operational practices and procedures, which could also have a negative effect on their financial positions and results of operations.Changes in accounting standards or rules may impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial results and disclosures. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the SEC have made and may continue to make changes to accounting standards that impact presentation and disclosures of financial condition and results of operations. Further, new accounting orders issued by the FERC could significantly impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's reported financial condition. IDACORP and Idaho Power do not have any control over the impact these changes may have on their financial conditions or results of operations nor the timing of such changes. Idaho Power meets the requirements under GAAP to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in its financial statements and to defer certain costs as regulatory assets until those costs are collected in rates, and to defer some items as regulatory liabilities. If recovery of these amounts ceases to be probable, if Idaho Power determines that it no longer meets the criteria for applying regulatory accounting or if accounting rules change to no longer provide for regulatory assets and liabilities, Idaho Power could be required to eliminate some or all of those regulatory assets or liabilities. Any of these circumstances could result in write-offs and have a material effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power’s financial condition and results of operations. Financial and Investment RisksFinancial and investment risks relate to IDACORP's and Idaho Power's ability to meet financial obligations and mitigate exposure to market risks, including liquidity risks and the ability to raise capital and cost of funding, risks related to credit ratings, credit risk, liquidity, interest rates, and commodity prices. Volatility or disruptions in the financial markets, failure of IDACORP or Idaho Power to satisfy conditions necessary for obtaining loans or issuing debt securities, and denial of regulatory authority to issue debt or equity securities, may negatively affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s ability to access capital and/or increase their cost of borrowing and ability to execute on their strategic plans. IDACORP and Idaho Power use credit facilities, commercial paper markets, and long-term debt as significant sources of liquidity and funding for operating and capital requirements and debt maturities not satisfied by operating cash flow. The credit facilities represent commitments by the participating banks to make loans and issue letters of credit. However, the ability and obligation of the participating banks to make those loans and issue letters of credit is subject to specified conditions and volatility or disruptions in the financial markets could affect the companies' ability to obtain debt financing or draw upon or renew existing credit facilities on favorable terms and comply with debt covenants. Idaho Power's ability to issue long-term debt is also subject to a number of conditions included in an indenture, and Idaho Power's ability to issue long-term debt and commercial paper is subject to the availability of purchasers willing to purchase the securities under reasonable terms or at all. Because of these limitations, IDACORP and Idaho Power may be unable to issue commercial paper or short-term or long-term debt at reasonable interest rates and terms or at all. Higher interest rates on short-term borrowings with variable interest rates could also have an adverse effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's operating results. Changes in interest rates may also impact the fair value of the debt securities in Idaho Power's pension funds, as well as Idaho Power's ability to earn a return on short-term investments of excess cash. Also, while the credit facilities represent a contractual obligation to make loans, one or more of the participating banks may default on their obligations to make loans under, or may withdraw from, the credit facilities. Idaho Power is required to obtain regulatory approval in Idaho, Oregon, and Wyoming in order to borrow money or to issue securities and is therefore dependent on the public utility commissions of those states to issue favorable orders in a timely 32Table of Contents                         manner to permit them to finance their operations, capital expenditures, and debt maturities. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's credit facilities include financial covenants that limit the amount of debt that can be outstanding as a percentage of total capital, and Idaho Power's long-term debt has also been issued under an indenture that contains a number of financial covenants. The companies must also make specified representations in connection with request for loans and it is possible that they may be unable to do so at the time of such request, which would limit or eliminate the obligation of the banks to provide loans. Failure to maintain these representations and covenants could preclude IDACORP and Idaho Power from issuing commercial paper, borrowing under their credit facilities, or issuing long-term debt, and could trigger a default and repayment obligation under debt instruments, which could limit their ability to pursue certain projects, acquisitions, or improvements, to support future growth, and adversely impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.  A downgrade in IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s credit ratings could affect the companies’ ability to access capital, increase their cost of borrowing, and require the companies to post collateral with transaction counterparties. Credit rating agencies periodically review the corporate credit ratings and long-term ratings of IDACORP and Idaho Power. These ratings are premised on financial ratios and performance, the regulatory environment and rate mechanisms, the effectiveness of management, resource risks and power supply costs, and other factors. IDACORP and Idaho Power also have borrowing arrangements that rely on the ability of the banks to fund loans or support commercial paper, a principal source of short-term financing. In addition, IDACORP's or Idaho Power's credit ratings may change as a result of the differing methodologies or change in the methodologies used by the various rating agencies. Downgrades of IDACORP’s or Idaho Power’s credit ratings, or those affecting relationship banks, could limit the companies’ ability to access short- and long-term capital under reasonable terms or at all, reduce the pool of potential lenders, increase borrowing costs under existing credit facilities, limit access to the commercial paper market, require the companies to pay a higher interest rate on their debt, limit the ability of IDACORP to declare and make dividends, and require the companies to post additional performance assurance collateral with transaction counterparties. If access to capital were to become significantly constrained or costs of capital increased significantly due to lowered credit ratings, prevailing industry conditions, regulatory constraints, the volatility of the capital markets or other factors, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions (including generating capacity and transmission assets, which may be necessary for future growth), liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.Changes in the method for determining LIBOR and the potential replacement of LIBOR may affect our credit facilities and the interest rates on such borrowings. LIBOR, the London interbank offered rate, is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. The interest rates for any borrowings under IDACORP and Idaho Power’s credit facilities, as amended in December 2019, are based on either (1) a floating rate that is equal to the highest of the prime rate, federal funds rate plus 0.5 percent, or LIBOR rate plus 1.0 percent, or (2) the LIBOR rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin, provided that the federal funds rate and LIBOR rate will not be less than zero percent, provided that, an alternate benchmark rate selected by the administrative agent for the credit facilities and IDACORP and Idaho Power will apply during any period in which the LIBOR rate is unavailable or unascertainable. In July 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. On November 30, 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR, with the support of the United States Federal Reserve and the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, announced plans to consult on ceasing publication of LIBOR on December 31, 2021 for only the one week and two month LIBOR tenors, and on June 30, 2023 for all other LIBOR tenors. While this announcement extends the transition period to June 2023, the United States Federal Reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new LIBOR issuances by the end of 2021. In the United States, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee has proposed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as an alternative to LIBOR. It is not presently known whether SOFR or any other alternative reference rates that have been proposed will attain market acceptance as replacements of LIBOR. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could cause IDACORP and Idaho Power to suffer from potential increases in interest rates on any borrowings. Idaho Power’s energy risk management policy and programs relating to economically hedging commodity exposures and credit risk may not always perform as intended, and as a result, IDACORP and Idaho Power may suffer economic losses. Idaho Power enters into transactions to buy and sell power, natural gas, and transmission service, enters into transactions to hedge its positions in coal, natural gas, power, and other commodities, and enters into financial hedge transactions to mitigate in part exposure to variable commodity prices. IDACORP and Idaho Power could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market value of these contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform. The derivative instruments used for hedging might not offset the underlying exposure being mitigated as intended, due to pricing inefficiencies or other terms of the derivative instruments, and any such failure to mitigate exposure could result in financial losses. Certain of Idaho Power's purchase or sale, hedging, and derivative agreements may result in the receipt of, or posting of, collateral with counterparties. Fluctuations in commodity prices that lead to the posting of collateral with counterparties negatively impact liquidity, and 33Table of Contents                         downgrades in Idaho Power's credit ratings may lead to additional collateral posting requirements. Idaho Power has additional indirect credit exposures to financial institutions in the form of letters of credit provided as security by power suppliers under various purchased power contracts and by vendors for infrastructure development projects. If any of the credit ratings of the letter of credit issuers were to drop below investment grade, the vendor or supplier would need to replace the security with an acceptable substitute, which may be impracticable and may expose Idaho Power to losses resulting from a vendor or supplier default. If the security were not replaced, the party could be in default under the contract and Idaho Power's remedies for default may be inadequate to fully compensate Idaho Power for its losses. Forecasts of future fuel needs and loads and available resources to meet those loads are inherently uncertain and may cause Idaho Power to over- or under-hedge actual resource needs, exposing the company to market risk on the over- or under-hedged position. To the extent that commodity markets are illiquid, Idaho Power may not be able to execute its risk management strategies, which could result in undesired over-exposure to unhedged positions that Idaho Power may not be able to collect in customer rates. The FERC may take action to limit volatility in the energy market by imposing price limits or other market restrictions to control market-based rate sales, which could adversely affect the companies' financial results. As a result, risk management actions, or the failure or inability to manage commodity availability and price and counterparty risk, may adversely affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s financial condition and results of operations. Further, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a counterparty to commodity or other transactions could impair Idaho Power’s ability to collect amounts receivable from those counterparties, potentially including the ability to collect or retain collateral posted by a counterparty. Idaho Power is a participant in the energy markets, including the Western EIM, and engages in direct and indirect power purchase and sale transactions in connection with that participation. The Western EIM has collateral posting requirements based on established credit criteria, but there is no assurance the collateral will be sufficient to cover obligations that counterparties may owe each other in the Western EIM and any such credit losses could be socialized to all Western EIM participants, including Idaho Power. A significant failure of a participant in the Western EIM to make payments when due on its obligations could have a ripple effect on various Idaho Power counterparties in the power, gas, and derivative markets if those counterparties experience ancillary liquidity issues, and could generally result in a decline in the ability of Idaho Power’s counterparties to perform on their obligations.  The performance of pension and postretirement benefit plan investments, increasing health care costs, and other factors impacting plan costs and funding obligations could adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations - primarily cash flows and liquidity. Idaho Power provides a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering most employees, as well as a defined benefit postretirement benefit plan (consisting of health care and death benefits) that covers eligible retirees. Costs of providing these benefits are based in part on the value of the plans' assets and, therefore, adverse investment performance for these assets or the failure to maintain sustained growth in pension investments over time could increase Idaho Power’s plan costs and funding requirements related to the plans. Idaho Power's self-insured costs of health care benefits for eligible employees and retirees have increased in recent years and Idaho Power believes that future legislative changes related to the provision of health care benefits and other external market conditions and factors, could cause such costs to continue to rise. As benefit costs continue to rise, there is no assurance that the IPUC and OPUC will continue to allow recovery. The key actuarial assumptions that affect pension funding obligations are the expected long-term return on plan assets and the discount rate used in determining future benefit obligations. Idaho Power evaluates the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis, taking into account changes in market conditions, trends, and future expectations. Estimates of future investment market performance, changes in interest rates, and other factors Idaho Power and its actuary firms use to develop the actuarial assumptions are inherently uncertain, and actual results could vary significantly from the estimates. Changes in demographics, including timing of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase Idaho Power's plan costs and funding requirements. Future pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments are also subject to the impacts of changes in legislation. Depending on the timing of contributions to the plans and Idaho Power's ability to recover costs through rates, cash contributions to the plans could reduce the cash available for the companies' businesses and payment of dividends. For additional information regarding Idaho Power's funding obligations under its benefit plans, see Note 12 - ""Benefit Plans"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. If the assumptions underlying coal mine reclamation at Bridger Coal Company and related forecast trust fund growth are materially inaccurate, Idaho Power’s costs could be greater than anticipated or be incurred sooner than anticipated. Bridger Coal Company (BCC), a subsidiary of Idaho Power located in the state of Wyoming, uses both surface and underground methods to mine coal to be used for power generation at the Jim Bridger power plant. The federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act and state laws and regulations establish operational, reclamation, bonding, and closure obligations and standards for mining of coal. Bridger Coal Company’s estimate of reclamation liability and bonding obligations is reviewed periodically by Idaho Power’s management committee, audit committee of the board of directors, external and internal auditors, and by government regulators. Idaho Power funds a trust and posts collateral in the form of a surety bond purchased jointly with the co-owner of BCC to cover such projected mine reclamation costs pursuant to the laws of the state of Wyoming. The trust 34Table of Contents                         funds are invested in debt and equity securities and poor performance of these investments would reduce the amount of funds available for their intended purpose, which could require Idaho Power to make additional cash contributions. If actual costs related to those obligations exceed estimates, government regulations relating to those obligations change significantly or unexpected cash funding obligations are required, IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.As a holding company, IDACORP does not have its own operating income and must rely on the cash flows from its subsidiaries to pay dividends and make debt payments. IDACORP is a holding company with no significant operations of its own, and its primary assets are shares or other ownership interests of its subsidiaries, primarily Idaho Power. IDACORP’s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts to IDACORP, whether through dividends, loans, or other means. The ability of IDACORP’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to IDACORP depends on several factors, including each subsidiary's actual and projected earnings and cash flow, capital requirements and general financial condition, regulatory restrictions, tax obligations, covenants contained in credit facilities to which they are parties, and the prior rights of holders of their existing and future first mortgage bonds and other debt or equity securities. Further, the amount and payment of dividends is at the discretion of the board of directors, which may reduce or cease payment of dividends at any time. See Note 7 - ""Common Stock"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a further description of restrictions on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's payment of dividends"
3,IDA,IDACORP INC,2020-02-20,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS IDACORP and Idaho Power operate in a highly regulated industry and business environment that involves significant risks, many of which are beyond the companies' control. The circumstances and factors set forth below should not be considered a complete list of potential risks that the companies may encounter. These risk factors may have a material impact on the business, financial condition, or results of operations of IDACORP and Idaho Power and could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in any forward-looking statements. These risk factors, as well as other information in this report, including without limitation, in Part II - Item 7 - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Matters Impacting Future Results"" in this report, and information in other reports the companies file with the SEC, may be important to understanding any statement in this 2019 Annual Report or elsewhere and should be considered carefully when making any investment decisions relating to IDACORP or Idaho Power. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's businesses regularly face risks, many of which may cause future results to be different than anticipated as of the date of this report. Below are certain important utility-specific regulatory, operational, legal and compliance, financial and investment, and general business risks. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's reactions to material future developments as well as the utility industry's reactions to those developments may also impact the Companies' future results.Utility-Specific Regulatory RisksUtility-specific regulatory risk includes the risks that federal, state, or local regulators may impose additional requirements and costs on Idaho Power and the utility industry, or require Idaho Power as a utility to make adverse changes to its business models, strategies, and practices. State or federal regulators may not approve customer rates that provide timely or sufficient recovery of Idaho Power's costs or allow Idaho Power to earn a reasonable rate of return, which could cause IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations to be adversely affected. The prices that the IPUC and OPUC authorize Idaho Power to charge customers for its retail services, and the tariff rate that the FERC permits Idaho Power to charge for its transmission services, are generally the most significant factors influencing IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s business, results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition. Idaho Power's ability to recover its costs and earn a reasonable rate of return can be affected by many regulatory factors, including the timing difference between when Idaho Power incurs costs and when Idaho Power recovers those costs in customers’ rates (often called ""regulatory lag"" in the utility industry), and differences between the costs included in rates and the amount of actual costs incurred. Idaho Power is often required to incur costs before the IPUC, OPUC, or FERC approves the recovery of those costs, such as construction costs for new facilities, changes in the long-term cost-effectiveness or changes to the operating conditions of Idaho Power's assets that could result in early retirements of utility facilities, the costs of compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements, increased funding levels of a defined benefit pension plan, and the costs of damage from fires, weather-related events, and natural disasters. The IPUC, OPUC, and FERC may not allow Idaho Power to recover some or all of those costs on the basis that they find Idaho Power did not reasonably or prudently incur those costs or for other reasons. Ratemaking has generally been premised on estimates of historic costs based on a test year, so if a given year’s actual costs are higher than historic costs, rates may not be sufficient to cover actual costs. While rate regulation is also premised on the assumption that rates established are fair, just, and reasonable, regulators have considerable discretion in applying this standard. Decisions are subject to judicial appeal, which could lead to further uncertainty in regulatory proceedings.Economic, political, legislative, public policy, or regulatory pressures may lead stakeholders to seek rate reductions or refunds, limits on rate increases, or lower allowed rates of return on investments for Idaho Power. The ratemaking process typically involves multiple intervening parties, including governmental bodies, consumer advocacy groups, and customers, generally with the common objective of limiting rate increases or even reducing rates. The IPUC and OPUC may adopt different methods of calculating the allocation of the total utility costs in their respective jurisdictions, resulting in certain costs excluded in both states. Compliance with state and federal regulatory standards may also limit Idaho Power's ability to operate profitably. In the past, Idaho Power has been denied recovery, or required to defer recovery pending the next general rate case, including denials or deferrals related to capital expenditures for long-term project expenses. Adverse outcomes in regulatory proceedings or significant regulatory lag may cause Idaho Power to record an impairment of its assets or otherwise adversely affect cash flows and earnings and result in lower credit ratings, reduced access to capital and higher financing costs, and reductions or delays in planned capital expenditures.For additional information relating to Idaho Power's state and federal regulatory framework and regulatory matters, see Part I - Item 1 - ""Business - Utility Operations,"" Part II - Item 7 - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 20Table of Contents Results of Operations - Regulatory Matters,"" and Note 3 - ""Regulatory Matters"" to the consolidated financial statements of Part II - Item 8 in this report. Idaho Power's cost recovery mechanisms may not function as intended and are subject to change or elimination, which may adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power has power cost adjustment mechanisms in its Idaho and Oregon jurisdictions and a fixed cost adjustment mechanism in Idaho. The power cost adjustment mechanisms track Idaho Power’s actual net power supply costs (primarily fuel and purchased power less wholesale energy sales) and compare these amounts to net power supply costs being recovered in retail rates. A majority of the differences between these two amounts is deferred for future recovery from, or refund to, customers through rates. Volatility in power supply costs continues to be significant, in large part due to fluctuations in hydropower generation conditions and high costs for the purchase of renewable energy under mandatory long-term contracts. While the power cost adjustment mechanisms function to mitigate the potentially adverse impact on net income of power supply cost volatility, the mechanisms do not eliminate the cash flow impact of that volatility. When power costs rise above the level recovered in current retail rates, Idaho Power incurs the costs but recovery of those costs is deferred to a subsequent collection period, which can adversely affect Idaho Power’s operating cash flow and liquidity until those costs are recovered from customers. The fixed cost adjustment mechanism is a decoupling mechanism designed to remove a portion of Idaho Power's disincentive to invest in and support energy efficiency activities. This mechanism allows Idaho Power to charge Idaho residential and small commercial customers when it recovers less than the base level of fixed costs per customer that the IPUC authorized for recovery in the most recent general rate case. The power cost and fixed cost adjustment mechanisms are generally subject to change at the discretion of applicable state regulators, who could decide to modify or eliminate either mechanism in a manner that adversely impacts IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. Operational RisksOperational risk relates to risks arising from the systems, assets, processes, people, and external factors that affect the operation of IDACORP's or Idaho Power's businesses.IDACORP's and Idaho Power's business, financial condition, and results of operations may be negatively affected by changes in customer growth or customer usage. Changes in the number of customers and customers' use of electricity are affected by a number of factors, such as population growth or decline in Idaho Power's service area, expansion or loss of service area, changes in customer needs and expectations, adoption rates of energy efficiency measures, customer-generated power such as from solar panels and gas-fired generators, demand-side management requirements, regulation or deregulation, and adverse economic conditions. An economic downturn or recession could also negatively impact customer use and reduce revenues and cash flows, thus adversely affecting results of operations. Many electric utilities, including Idaho Power, have experienced a decline in usage per customer, in part attributable to energy efficiency activities. State or federal regulations may be enacted to encourage or require mandatory energy conservation or technological advances that increase energy efficiency, which could further reduce usage per customer. Also, changing customer needs and expectations could lead to lower customer satisfaction, reduced loyalty, difficulty in obtaining rate increases, legislation to deregulate electric service, and customers seeking alternative sources of energy and electric service. If customers choose to generate their own energy, discontinue a portion or all service from Idaho Power, or replace electric power for heating with natural gas, demand for Idaho Power's energy may decline and adversely impact the affordability of its services for remaining customers. While Idaho Power has recently experienced a net growth in usage due to an increase in the number of customers, when adjusted for the impacts of weather, the average monthly usage on a per customer basis for Idaho residential customers has declined from 1,039 kWh in 2010 to 936 kWh in 2019. Rate mechanisms, such as the Idaho fixed cost adjustment, are designed to address the financial disincentive associated with promoting energy efficiency activities, but there is no assurance that the mechanism will result in full or timely collection of Idaho Power's fixed costs, which are currently collected in large part through the company's volume-based energy rates that are based on historical sales volume. Any undercollection of fixed costs would adversely impact revenues, earnings, and cash flows. The formation of municipal utilities or similar entities for distribution systems within Idaho Power's service area could also result in a load decrease. The loss of loads resulting from some of these events may result in IDACORP and Idaho Power modifying or eliminating large generation or transmission projects. This could in turn result in reduced revenues as well as write-downs or write-offs if regulators determine that the costs of the projects were incurred imprudently, which could have a material adverse impact on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Conversely, if Idaho Power were to experience an unanticipated increase in the demand for energy through, for example, the rapid addition of new industrial and commercial customers or population growth in the service area, Idaho Power may be required to rely on higher-cost purchased power to meet peak system demand and may need to accelerate investment in additional generation or transmission resources. If the incremental costs associated with the unanticipated changes in loads 21Table of Contents exceed the incremental revenue received from the sales to the new customers, and Idaho Power is unable to secure timely and full rate relief to recover those increased costs, the resulting imbalance could have an adverse effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.Changes in weather conditions, severe weather, and the impacts of climate change can adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's operating results and cause them to fluctuate seasonally. Idaho Power's electric power sales are seasonal, with demand in Idaho Power's service area peaking during the hot summer months, with a secondary peak during the cold winter months. Electric power demands by irrigation customers in Idaho Power's service area, which are impacted by temperatures and the timing and amount of precipitation, can also create significant seasonal changes in usage. Seasonality of revenues may be further impacted by Idaho Power's tiered rate structure, under which rates charged to customers are often higher during higher-load periods, such as hot summers and cold winters. Market prices for power also often increase significantly during these peak periods, at times when Idaho Power is required to purchase power in the wholesale markets to meet customer demand. By contrast, when temperatures are relatively mild or where precipitation supplants irrigation systems, loads are often lower as customers are not using electricity for heating and air conditioning or irrigation purposes. Thus, weather conditions and the timing and extent of precipitation can cause IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition to fluctuate seasonally, quarterly, and from year to year. Climate change could also have significant physical effects in Idaho Power’s service area, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, lightning, droughts, heat waves, fires, floods, snow loading, and other extreme weather events, and impact Idaho Power’s ability to generate or import power on transmission lines from other geographic areas. These extreme weather events and their associated impacts could damage transmission, distribution, and generation facilities, causing service interruptions and extended or mass outages, increasing costs and other operating and maintenance expenses, including emergency response planning and preparedness expenses, and limiting Idaho Power's ability to meet customer energy demand. Sustained drought conditions or decreased snow pack due to higher temperatures are likely to decrease power generation from hydropower plants.Idaho Power's customers' energy needs vary with weather and to the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, customers' energy use could increase or decrease. Increased energy use due to weather changes may require Idaho Power to invest in generating assets and transmission and distribution infrastructure, while decreased energy use due to weather changes may result in decreased revenues. Extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand may raise wholesale electricity prices for power that Idaho Power purchases to serve customers, increasing the cost of energy Idaho Power provides to its customers, and at the same time can increase the revenues Idaho Power receives for wholesale market sales of excess generation during regional extreme weather events. Variations in hydropower generation that increase Idaho Power's reliance on market purchases may lead to more costly power supply sources for its customers and reduce benefits from selling surplus hydropower in the wholesale market. The price of power in the wholesale energy markets tends to be higher during periods of high regional demand that tends to occur with weather extremes, which may cause Idaho Power to purchase power in the wholesale market during peak price periods, increasing power supply costs. The costs of repairing and replacing infrastructure or liability for personal injury, loss of life, and property damage from utility equipment that fails as a result of significant weather and weather-related events, including fires, may not be covered in full by insurance. Costs incurred in connection with such events might also not be recovered through customer rates if the costs incurred are greater than those allowed for recovery by regulators. In addition, state and federal legislation and regulations have been proposed in recent years; including in the State of Oregon, to limit the severity and impact of climate change, such as imposing mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, which could increase Idaho Power’s power supply and compliance costs. If financial markets increasingly view climate change or greenhouse gas emissions as a financial or investment risk for electric utilities, it could negatively affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's ability to access debt and equity capital markets on favorable terms. For additional information relating to legislation, regulations, and legal proceedings related to environmental matters, see Part II - Item 7 - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Matters"" in this report.New advances in power generation, energy efficiency, alternative energy sources, or other technologies that impact the power utility industry could cause decreased customer energy demand and decreased revenues. Advances in technology and changes in customer demand and preferences in the electric utility industry have encouraged the development of new technologies for power generation, power storage, and energy efficiency. In particular, in recent years the net cost of solar generation has decreased significantly, and there are federal and state regulations, laws, and other incentives in place to help further reduce the net cost of solar generation. There is potential that customer-owned power generation systems, particularly if coupled with power storage devices, could become sufficiently cost-effective and efficient that an increasing number of Idaho Power's customers choose to install such systems on their homes or businesses, which in turn could require changes in the way 22Table of Contents Idaho Power manages its distribution systems, and reduce the demand for and sale of energy. Additionally, considerable emphasis has been placed on energy efficiency, such as LED lighting and high-efficiency appliances. Energy efficiency programs, including programs sponsored by Idaho Power under a directive from state regulatory commissions, are designed to reduce energy use and demand. The introduction of new technologies could pose risks in the form of reduced sales and new business models for energy services. Advances in technology that reduce the costs of alternative methods of producing electric energy could result in loss of revenue and customers, and may require Idaho Power to make significant expenditure reductions to remain competitive. These changes in technology could also alter the channels through which customers buy or utilize energy, which could reduce Idaho Power's revenues or impact Idaho Power's expenses. A reduction in load, however, would not necessarily reduce Idaho Power's need for ongoing investments in its infrastructure to reliably serve its customers. If Idaho Power is unable to adjust its rate design or maintain adequate regulatory mechanisms allowing for timely cost recovery, declining usage from customer-owned generation sources and energy efficiency would result in under-recovery of Idaho Power's costs and investment in infrastructure, and reduce revenues, which would impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Acts or threats of terrorism, cyber attacks, data or physical security breaches, and other acts of individuals or groups seeking to disrupt Idaho Power's operations or the electric power grid could require significant expenditures, or result in claims against the companies, and negatively impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power operates in an industry that requires the continuous use and operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. Idaho Power's generation and transmission facilities and its grid operations are potential targets for terrorist acts and threats, as well as cyber attacks and other disruptive activities of individuals or groups, including by nation states or nation state-sponsored groups. Federal regulators have stated that a number of organizations continue to seek opportunities to exploit potential vulnerabilities in the U.S. energy infrastructure and that those attacks have become increasingly frequent and sophisticated. Some of Idaho Power's facilities are deemed ""critical infrastructure,"" in that incapacity or destruction of the facilities could have a debilitating impact on security, reliability or operability of the bulk electric power system, national economic security, and public health and safety. The possibility that infrastructure facilities, such as generation facilities and electric transmission or distribution facilities, would be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror or cyber attack, including by nation states or nation state-sponsored groups (whether originating internally or externally), may affect Idaho Power's operations by limiting the ability to generate, purchase, or transmit power. Idaho Power's electric transmission systems are part of an interconnected regional grid, and therefore, it faces the risk of causing or being subject to a blackout due to grid disturbances or disruptions on a neighboring interconnected system. Cyber threats and attacks can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across networks, information systems, and other technologies. Network, information systems, and technology-related events, including those caused by IDACORP or Idaho Power, such as process breakdowns, human error, security architecture or design vulnerabilities, or by third parties, such as computer hackings, cyber attacks, computer viruses, or other destructive or disruptive software, denial of service attacks, social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing, could result in a degradation or disruption in the energy grid and the services of the companies. Physical or cyber attacks against key suppliers or service providers could have a similar effect on IDACORP and Idaho Power. Political, economic, social, or financial market instability or damage to or interference with Idaho Power’s operating assets, customers, or suppliers may result in business interruptions, lost revenue, higher commodity prices, disruption in fuel supplies, lower energy consumption, and unstable markets, particularly with respect to electricity and natural gas, and increased security, repair, or other costs, any of which may materially adversely affect Idaho Power in ways that cannot be predicted as of the date of this report. The breach of certain information technology systems could adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's ability to correctly record, process and report customer, business, and financial information. Any of these risks could materially affect the companies’ consolidated financial results. These events, and governmental actions in response, could result in a material decrease in revenues and increase costs to protect, repair, and insure Idaho Power's assets and operate its business.  Idaho Power's operations require the continuous availability of information technology systems and network infrastructure, and in the normal course of business, Idaho Power or its vendors collect and store sensitive and confidential customer and employee information and proprietary information of Idaho Power. No security measures can completely shield Idaho Power's systems, infrastructure, and data from vulnerabilities to cyber attacks, human error, intrusions, or other catastrophic events that could result in their failure or reduced functionality, and ultimately the potential loss of sensitive information or the loss of Idaho Power's ability to fulfill critical business functions and provide reliable electric power to customers. Any security breaches, such as misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in IDACORP's and Idaho Power's information technology systems, including customer data, could result in violations of privacy and other laws, financial loss to Idaho Power or to its customers, customer dissatisfaction or diminished customer confidence, damage to Idaho Power’s reputation, and significant litigation and penalty exposure, all of which could materially affect Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.23Table of Contents Changes in capital expenditures for infrastructure and the risks associated with permitting and construction of utility infrastructure can significantly affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power’s business is capital intensive and requires significant investments in energy generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure. A significant portion of Idaho Power’s facilities were constructed many years ago, and thus require periodic upgrades and frequent maintenance. Also, long-term anticipated increases in both the number of customers and the demand for energy require expansion and reinforcement of that infrastructure. For instance, Idaho Power is in the permitting process for two high-voltage transmission line projects, which are intended to help meet future customer energy demands. Construction projects are subject to usual permitting and construction risks that can adversely affect project costs and the completion time. These risks include, as examples:•the ability to timely obtain labor or materials at reasonable costs;•defaults by suppliers and contractors; •equipment, engineering, and design failures; •unexpected environmental and geological problems;•the effects of adverse weather conditions; •availability of financing; •load forecasts;•the ability to obtain and comply with permits and land use rights, and environmental constraints; and•delays and costs associated with disputes and litigation with third parties. The occurrence of any of these risks could cause Idaho Power to operate at reduced capacity levels, which in turn could reduce revenues, increase expenses, or cause Idaho Power to incur penalties. If Idaho Power is unable or unwilling to complete the permitting or construction of a project, or incurs costs that regulators do not deem prudent, it may be unable to recover its costs in full through rates or on a timely basis. Further, if Idaho Power is unable to secure permits or joint funding commitments to develop transmission infrastructure necessary to serve loads or if other resources become more economical, it may terminate those projects and, as alternatives, seek to develop additional generation facilities within areas where Idaho Power has available transmission capacity or pursue other more costly options to serve loads. To limit the timing-related risks of these projects, Idaho Power may enter into purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals or permits. If any of the projects are canceled for any reason, including Idaho Power's failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals or permits or because the project is no longer economical, Idaho Power could incur significant cancellation penalties under purchase orders or construction contracts. Additionally, termination of a project carries with it the potential for impairment of the associated asset if regulators deny full recovery of project costs. Thus, termination of a project could negatively affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.Factors contributing to lower hydropower generation can increase costs and negatively impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power derives a significant portion of its power supply from its hydropower facilities. During 2018 and 2019, 65 percent and 62 percent, respectively, of Idaho Power's electric power from Idaho Power-owned generation was from hydropower facilities. Due to Idaho Power’s heavy reliance on hydropower generation, factors such as precipitation and snowpack, the timing of run-off, and the availability of water in the Snake River basin can significantly affect its operations. The combination of a long-term trend of declining Snake River base flows, over-appropriation of water, and periods of drought have led to water rights disputes and proceedings among surface water and ground water irrigators and the State of Idaho. Recharging the Eastern Snake Plain aquifer by diverting surface water to porous locations and permitting it to sink into the aquifer is one approach to the over-appropriation dispute. Diversions from the Snake River for aquifer recharge or the loss of water rights reduce Snake River flows available for hydropower generation. When hydropower generation is reduced, Idaho Power must increase its use of more expensive thermal generating resources and market power purchases; therefore, costs increase and opportunities for wholesale energy sales are reduced, reducing revenues and potentially earnings. Through its power cost adjustment mechanisms, Idaho Power expects to recover most (but not all) of the increase in net power supply costs caused by lower hydropower generation. The timing of recovery of the increased costs, however, may not occur until the subsequent power cost adjustment year, adversely affecting cash flows and liquidity.Idaho Power’s use of coal and natural gas to fuel power generation facilities exposes it to commodity availability and price risk, which can adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition. As part of its normal business operations, Idaho Power purchases coal and natural gas in the open market or under short-term or long-term contracts, often with variable pricing terms. Market prices for coal and natural gas are volatile and influenced by factors impacting supply and demand such as weather conditions, the adequacy and type of generating capacity, fuel transportation availability, economic conditions, regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions, and changes in technology. Natural gas 24Table of Contents transportation to Idaho Power's three natural gas plants is limited to one primary pipeline, presenting a heightened possibility of supply constraint and disruptions separate from the risk of counterparty default. Most of Idaho Power's coal supply arrangements are under long-term contracts for coal originating in Wyoming, and thus Idaho Power is exposed to risk of disruption of coal production in, or transportation from, that region. Idaho Power may from time to time enter into new, or renegotiate, these long-term contracts but can provide no assurance that such contracts will be negotiated or renegotiated on satisfactory terms, or at all. There also can be no assurance that counterparties to the natural gas or coal supply agreements will fulfill their obligations to supply natural gas or coal, and they may experience regulatory, financial, or technical problems or unforeseeable events that inhibit their ability to deliver natural gas or coal. Disruptions in transportation of fuel and defaults by coal and natural gas suppliers may cause Idaho Power to seek alternative, and potentially more costly, sources of fuel or rely on other generation sources or wholesale market power purchases. Idaho Power's failure to provide service due to such disruptions may also result in fines, penalties, or cost disallowances through the regulatory process. Idaho Power may not be able to fully or timely recover these increased costs through rates, which may adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power’s generation, transmission, and distribution facilities are subject to numerous operational risks unique to it and its industry. Operating risks associated with Idaho Power's generation, transmission, and distribution facilities include equipment failures, volatility in fuel and transportation pricing, interruptions in fuel supplies, increased regulatory compliance costs, labor disputes or attrition, accidents and workforce safety matters, release of hazardous or toxic substances into the air, water, or ground, wildfires, acts of terrorism or sabotage (both cyber and asset-based), the loss of cost-effective disposal options for solid waste such as coal ash, operator error, and the occurrence of catastrophic events at the facilities. Diminished availability or performance of those facilities could result in reduced customer satisfaction, reputational harm, liability to third parties (including tort liability), and regulatory inquiries and fines. Operation of Idaho Power's owned and co-owned generating stations below expected capacity levels, or unplanned outages at these stations, could cause reduced energy output and lower efficiency levels and result in lost revenues and increased expenses for alternative fuels or wholesale market power purchases. Further, the transmission system in Idaho Power's service area is constrained, limiting the ability to transmit electric energy within the service area and access electric energy from outside the service area during high-load periods. Idaho Power's transmission facilities are also interconnected with those of third parties, and thus operation of Idaho Power's and third-parties' facilities could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events. These transmission constraints and events could result in failure to provide reliable service to customers and the inability to deliver energy from generating facilities to the power grid, and the inability to access lower cost sources of electric energy. Idaho Power also enters into agreements with third-party contractors to perform work on its generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, and may in some circumstances retain liability for the quality and completion of those contractors’ work, potentially subjecting Idaho Power to penalties, liability for personal injury, loss of life, or property damage, reputational harm, or enforcement actions or liability if a contractor violates applicable laws, rules, regulations, or orders.Accidents, terrorist acts, electrical contacts, fires, explosions, catastrophic failures, general system damage or dysfunction, uncontrolled release of water from hydropower dams, and other unplanned events related to Idaho Power's infrastructure would increase repair costs and may expose Idaho Power to liability for personal injury, loss of life, and property damage. Fires alleged to have been caused by Idaho Power's transmission, distribution, or generation infrastructure, or that allegedly result from Idaho Power’s or its contractors’ operating or maintenance practices, could also expose Idaho Power to claims for fire suppression and clean-up costs, evacuation costs, fines and penalties, and liability for economic damages, personal injury, loss of life, property damage, and environmental pollution, whether based on claims of negligence, trespass, or otherwise. The risk of wildfires is exacerbated in forested areas where beetle infestations have caused a significant increase in the quantity of standing dead and dying timber, increasing the risk that such trees may fall from either inside or outside our right-of-way into a powerline igniting a fire and increasing the magnitude of fires. A significant number of urban-wildland interfaces in and near Idaho Power's service area, and commonly hot, dry summer conditions, increase the likelihood and magnitude of damages that may be caused by fires burning into or allegedly originating from utility equipment. Idaho Power maintains insurance coverage for such operating and event risks, but insurance coverage is subject to the terms and limitations of the available policies and may not be sufficient in amount to cover Idaho Power’s ultimate liability. Coverage limits within wildfire insurance policies could result in material self-insured costs in the event there are fires that are deemed to be separate occurrences covered by self-insured retention amounts under the terms of Idaho Power’s insurance policies. Idaho Power or its contractors and customers could also experience coverage reductions and increased wildfire insurance costs in future years. Idaho Power may be unable to fully recover costs in excess of insurance through customer rates or regulatory mechanisms and, even if such recovery is possible, it could take several years to collect. If the amount of insurance is insufficient or otherwise unavailable, and if Idaho Power is unable to fully recover in rates the costs of uninsured losses, IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially affected.25Table of Contents Purchases of power from renewable energy projects, and integration of power generated from those projects into Idaho Power's system, may increase costs and decrease system reliability, and adversely affect Idaho Power's and IDACORP's results of operations and financial condition. An abundance of intermittent, non-dispatchable generation from renewable energy projects interconnected with Idaho Power's system has had an impact on the operation of Idaho Power's generation plants, system reliability, power supply costs, and the wholesale power markets in the Pacific Northwest. Idaho Power is generally obligated under federal law to purchase power from certain renewable energy projects, regardless of the then-current load demand, availability of lower cost generation resources, or wholesale energy market prices. As of December 31, 2019, Idaho Power had federally-mandated contracts to purchase energy from 127 on-line projects with third parties. This increases the likelihood and frequency that Idaho Power will be required to reduce output from its lower-cost hydropower and fossil fuel-fired generation resources, which in turn increases power purchase costs and customer rates and impacts Idaho Power's ability to invest in additional generation. Increases in customer rates could make self-generation more financially attractive for customers, which could result in reduced net load and revenue and shifts in customer costs. Further, balancing load and generation from Idaho Power's power generation portfolio is challenging, and Idaho Power expects that its operational costs will continue to increase as a result of its efforts to integrate intermittent, non-dispatchable generation from a large number of renewable energy projects. If Idaho Power is unable to timely recover those costs through its power cost adjustment mechanisms or otherwise, those increased costs may negatively affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Legal and Compliance RisksLegal and compliance risk relates to risks arising from government and regulatory action and from legal proceedings and compliance with applicable laws, rules, orders, regulations, policies, and procedures, including those related to financial reporting, environmental, health, and safety, and potential changes in legal requirements.Changes in legislation, regulation, and government policy may have a material adverse effect on IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s business in the future. Changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, federal, state, and local legislation, regulation, and government policy could significantly impact IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s businesses and the electric utility industry. Specific legislative and regulatory proposals and recently enacted legislation that could have a material impact on IDACORP and Idaho Power include, but are not limited to, tax reform, utility regulation, infrastructure renewal programs, environmental regulation, and modifications to accounting and public company reporting requirements. Further, the proposals and new legislation could have an impact on the rate of growth of Idaho Power’s customers and their willingness to expand operations and increase electric service requirements. Laws, regulations, and policies relating to environmental compliance could change and require IDACORP and Idaho Power and their customers to modify their business strategy or affect their returns on investment by restricting activities and projects or subjecting them to increased compliance costs. Although the United States has not adopted any international or federal greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets, many states and localities may continue to pursue climate policies in the absence of federal mandates. The state of Oregon, for instance, has been pursuing cap-and-trade legislation for greenhouse gas emissions. Idaho Power could also become subject to climate change lawsuits and an adverse outcome could require substantial expenditures and could possibly require payment of damages. Defense costs associated with such litigation can also be significant. Such payments or expenditures could affect results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates. IDACORP and Idaho Power are monitoring the implementation by federal, state, and local governmental authorities of various executive orders and are unable to predict whether and to what extent such actions will meaningfully change existing legislative and regulatory environments relevant to the companies, or if any such changes would have a net positive or negative impact on the companies. To the extent that such changes have a negative impact on the companies or Idaho Power’s customers, including as a result of related uncertainty, these changes may materially and adversely impact IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.Changes in income tax laws and regulations, or differing interpretation or enforcement of applicable laws by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdictions, could have a material adverse impact on IDACORP’s or Idaho Power’s financial condition and results of operations. IDACORP and Idaho Power must make judgments and interpretations about the application of the law when determining the provision for income taxes. Amounts of income tax-related assets and liabilities involve judgments and estimates of the timing and probability of recognition of income, deductions, and tax credits, which are subject to challenge by taxing authorities. These judgments may include estimates for potential outcomes regarding tax positions that may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities. Disputes over interpretations of tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority in examination, upon appeal, or through litigation. In recent years, state regulatory mechanisms with income tax-related provisions (such as Idaho Power's May 2018 Idaho tax reform settlement stipulation with the IPUC), has significantly impacted IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations. The outcome of potential future income tax proceedings, or the state public utility commissions' treatment of those outcomes, could differ materially from the amounts 26Table of Contents IDACORP and Idaho Power record prior to conclusion of those proceedings, and the difference could negatively affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s earnings and cash flows. Further, in some instances, the treatment from a ratemaking perspective of any net income tax expense or benefit could be different than IDACORP or Idaho Power anticipate or request from applicable state regulatory commissions, which could have a negative effect on their financial condition and results of operations. In addition, Idaho Power uses the regulatory flow-through income tax accounting method as described in Note 1 - ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report, and potential changes in income tax laws or interpretations may impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's income taxes and reporting obligations differently than most other companies.IDACORP's and Idaho Power’s businesses are subject to an extensive set of environmental laws, rules, and regulations, which could impact their operations and costs of operations, potentially rendering some generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate, and could increase the costs and alter the timing of major projects. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's operations are subject to a number of federal, state, and local environmental statutes, rules, and regulations relating to air and water quality, natural resources, renewable energy, and health and safety. Many of these laws and regulations are described in Part II - Item 7 - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Matters"" in this report. These laws and regulations generally require IDACORP and Idaho Power to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, and other approvals, including through substantial investment in pollution controls, and may be enforced by both public officials and private individuals. Some of these regulations are pending, changing, or subject to interpretation, and failure to comply may result in penalties, mandatory operational changes, and other adverse consequences, including costs associated with defending against claims by governmental authorities or private parties and complying with new operating requirements. Idaho Power devotes significant resources to environmental monitoring, pollution control equipment, and mitigation projects to comply with existing and anticipated environmental regulations. However, it is possible that federal, state and local authorities could attempt to enforce more stringent standards, stricter regulation, and more expansive application of environmental regulations. Environmental regulations have created the need for Idaho Power to install new pollution control equipment at, and may cause Idaho Power to perform environmental remediation on, its owned and co-owned power generation facilities, often at a substantial cost. Compliance with environmental regulations can significantly increase capital spending, operating costs, and plant outages, and can negatively affect the affordability of Idaho Power's services for customers. Idaho Power cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures necessary to comply with these environmental laws and regulations, although Idaho Power expects the expenditures will be substantial. In some cases, the costs to obtain permits and ensure facilities are in compliance may be prohibitively expensive. If the costs of compliance with new regulations renders the generating facilities uneconomical to maintain or operate, Idaho Power would need to identify alternative resources for power, potentially in the form of new generation and transmission facilities, market power purchases, demand-side management programs, or a combination of these and other methods. Furthermore, Idaho Power may not be able to obtain or maintain all environmental regulatory approvals necessary for operation of its existing infrastructure or construction of new infrastructure.  In response to state and federal regulatory requirements, judicial decisions and international accords, emissions of greenhouse gases including, most significantly CO2 could be restricted in the future. If new emissions reduction rules were to become effective, they could result in significant additional compliance costs that would affect Idaho Power's future financial position, results of operations, and cash flows if such costs are not timely recovered through regulated rates. Moreover, the possibility exists that stricter laws, regulations, or enforcement policies could significantly increase compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary. In addition, some environmental regulations are currently subject to litigation and not yet final. As a result of this uncertainty, approaches to comply with the regulations, including available control technologies or other allowed compliance measures, are unpredictable and Idaho Power cannot foresee the potential impacts these regulations would have on Idaho Power's operations or financial condition. Idaho Power is not guaranteed timely or full recovery through customer rates or insurance of costs associated with environmental regulations, environmental compliance, plant closures, or clean-up of contamination. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if Idaho Power fails to obtain, maintain, or comply with any such approval, construction and/or operation of Idaho Power's generation or transmission facilities could be delayed, halted, or subjected to additional costs. For further discussion of environmental matters that may affect Idaho Power, see ""Environmental Matters"" in ""Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in this report.Obligations imposed in connection with hydropower license renewals may require large capital expenditures, increase operating costs, reduce hydropower generation, and negatively affect IDACORP's or Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition. For the last several years, Idaho Power has been engaged in an effort to renew its federal license for its 27Table of Contents largest hydropower generation source, the Hells Canyon Complex. Relicensing includes an extensive public review process that involves numerous natural resource issues and environmental conditions. The existence of endangered and threatened species in the watershed may result in major operational changes to the region’s hydropower projects, which may be reflected in hydropower licenses, including for the Hells Canyon Complex. In addition, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to hydropower facilities, which could further increase required expenditures for marine life recovery and endangered species protection and reduce the amount of hydropower generation available to meet Idaho Power’s generation requirements. Idaho Power cannot predict the requirements that might be imposed during the relicensing process, the financial impact of those requirements, whether a new multi-year license will ultimately be issued, and whether the IPUC or OPUC will allow recovery through rates of the substantial costs incurred in connection with the licensing process and subsequent compliance. Imposition of onerous conditions in the relicensing process could result in Idaho Power incurring significant capital expenditures, increase operating costs (including power purchase costs), and reduce hydropower generation, which could negatively affect results of operations and financial condition.Idaho Power could be subject to penalties, reputational harm, and operational changes if it violates mandatory reliability and security requirements, which could adversely impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition. As an owner and operator of a bulk power transmission system, Idaho Power is subject to mandatory reliability and security standards issued by the FERC and other regulators. The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability, security, and market interface principles. Compliance with reliability standards subjects Idaho Power to higher operating costs and increased capital expenditures. Idaho Power has received in recent years notices of violations from, and regularly self-reports reliability standard compliance issues to, the FERC, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and the Western Electricity Coordinating Council. Potential monetary and non-monetary penalties for a violation of FERC regulations may be substantial, and in some circumstances monetary penalties may exceed $1.3 million per day per violation. As a utility with a large customer base, Idaho Power is subject to adverse publicity focused on the reliability of its services and the speed with which it is able to respond to electric outages caused by storm damage or other unanticipated events. Adverse publicity could harm the reputations of IDACORP and Idaho Power; may make state legislatures, utility commissions, and other regulatory authorities less likely to view the companies in a favorable light; and may cause Idaho Power to be subject to less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes or increased regulatory oversight. The imposition of any of the foregoing on Idaho Power for its actual or alleged failure to comply with reliability and security requirements could also have a negative effect on its and IDACORP’s results of operations and financial condition.IDACORP and Idaho Power are subject to costs and other effects of legal and regulatory proceedings, disputes, and claims. From time to time in the normal course of business, IDACORP and Idaho Power are subject to various lawsuits, regulatory proceedings, disputes, and claims that could result in adverse judgments or settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, or other adverse consequences. These matters are subject to a number of uncertainties, and management is often unable to predict the outcome of such matters; resulting liabilities could exceed amounts currently reserved or insured against with respect to such matter. The legal costs and final resolution of matters in which IDACORP or Idaho Power are involved could have reputational impact and a short- or long-term negative effect on their financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, the terms of resolution could require the companies to change their operational practices and procedures, which could also have a negative effect on their financial positions and results of operations.Financial and Investment RisksFinancial and investment risks relate to IDACORP's and Idaho Power's ability to meet financial obligations and mitigate exposure to market risks, including liquidity risks and the ability to raise capital and cost of funding, risks related to credit ratings, credit risk, liquidity, interest rates, and commodity prices. Volatility or disruptions in the financial markets, failure of IDACORP or Idaho Power to satisfy conditions necessary for obtaining loans or issuing debt securities, and denial of regulatory authority to issue debt or equity securities, may negatively affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s ability to access capital and/or increase their cost of borrowing and ability to execute on their strategic plans. IDACORP and Idaho Power use credit facilities, commercial paper markets, and long-term debt as significant sources of liquidity and funding for operating and capital requirements and debt maturities not satisfied by operating cash flow. The credit facilities represent commitments by the participating banks to make loans and issue letters of credit. However, the ability and obligation of the participating banks to make those loans and issue letters of credit is subject to specified conditions and volatility or disruptions in the financial markets could affect the companies' ability to obtain debt financing or draw upon or renew existing credit facilities on favorable terms. Idaho Power's ability to issue long-term debt is also subject to a number of conditions included in an indenture, and Idaho Power's ability to issue long-term debt and commercial paper is subject to the availability of purchasers willing to purchase the securities under reasonable terms or at all. 28Table of Contents Because of these limitations, IDACORP and Idaho Power may be unable to issue commercial paper or short-term or long-term debt at reasonable interest rates and terms or at all. Higher interest rates on short-term borrowings with variable interest rates could also have an adverse effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's operating results. Changes in interest rates may also impact the fair value of the debt securities in Idaho Power's pension funds, as well as Idaho Power's ability to earn a return on short-term investments of excess cash. Also, while the credit facilities represent a contractual obligation to make loans, one or more of the participating banks may default on their obligations to make loans under, or may withdraw from, the credit facilities. Idaho Power is required to obtain regulatory approval in Idaho, Oregon, and Wyoming in order to borrow money or to issue securities and is therefore dependent on the public utility commissions of those states to issue favorable orders in a timely manner to permit them to finance their operations, capital expenditures, and debt maturities. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's credit facilities include financial covenants that limit the amount of debt that can be outstanding as a percentage of total capital, and Idaho Power's long-term debt has also been issued under an indenture that contains a number of financial covenants. The companies must also make specified representations in connection with request for loans and it is possible that they may be unable to do so at the time of such request, which would limit or eliminate the obligation of the banks to provide loans. Failure to maintain these representations and covenants could preclude IDACORP and Idaho Power from issuing commercial paper, borrowing under their credit facilities, or issuing long-term debt, and could trigger a default and repayment obligation under debt instruments, which could limit their ability to pursue certain projects and adversely impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.  A downgrade in IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s credit ratings could affect the companies’ ability to access capital, increase their cost of borrowing, and require the companies to post collateral with transaction counterparties. Credit rating agencies periodically review the corporate credit ratings and long-term ratings of IDACORP and Idaho Power. These ratings are premised on financial ratios and performance, the regulatory environment and rate mechanisms, the effectiveness of management, resource risks and power supply costs, and other factors. IDACORP and Idaho Power also have borrowing arrangements that rely on the ability of the banks to fund loans or support commercial paper, a principal source of short-term financing. In addition, IDACORP's or Idaho Power's credit ratings may change as a result of the differing methodologies or change in the methodologies used by the various rating agencies. Downgrades of IDACORP’s or Idaho Power’s credit ratings, or those affecting relationship banks, could limit the companies’ ability to access short- and long-term capital under reasonable terms or at all, reduce the pool of potential lenders, increase borrowing costs under existing credit facilities, limit access to the commercial paper market, require the companies to pay a higher interest rate on their debt, limit the ability of IDACORP to declare and make dividends, and require the companies to post additional performance assurance collateral with transaction counterparties. If access to capital were to become significantly constrained or costs of capital increased significantly due to lowered credit ratings, prevailing industry conditions, regulatory constraints, the volatility of the capital markets or other factors, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions (including generating capacity and transmission assets, which may be necessary for future growth), financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Changes in the method for determining LIBOR and the potential replacement of LIBOR may affect our credit facilities and the interest rates on such borrowings. LIBOR, the London interbank offered rate, is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. The interest rates for any borrowings under IDACORP and Idaho Power’s credit facilities, as amended in November 2019, are based on either (1) a floating rate that is equal to the highest of the prime rate, federal funds rate plus 0.5 percent, or LIBOR rate plus 1.0 percent, or (2) the LIBOR rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin, provided that the federal funds rate and LIBOR rate will not be less than zero percent, provided that, an alternate benchmark rate selected by the administrative agent for the credit facilities and IDACORP and Idaho Power will apply during any period in which the LIBOR rate is unavailable or unascertainable. In July 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear if at that time LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. If the method for calculation of LIBOR changes, if LIBOR is no longer available, or if lenders have increased costs due to changes in LIBOR, IDACORP and Idaho Power may suffer from potential increases in interest rates on any borrowings. Idaho Power’s risk management policy and programs relating to economically hedging commodity exposures and credit risk may not always perform as intended, and as a result, IDACORP and Idaho Power may suffer economic losses. Idaho Power enters into transactions to buy and sell power, natural gas, and transmission service, enters into transactions to hedge its positions in coal, natural gas, power, and other commodities, and enters into financial hedge transactions to mitigate in part exposure to variable commodity prices. IDACORP and Idaho Power could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market value of these contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform. The derivative instruments used for hedging might not offset the underlying exposure being mitigated as intended, due to pricing inefficiencies or other terms of the derivative 29Table of Contents instruments, and any such failure to mitigate exposure could result in financial losses. Certain of Idaho Power's purchase or sale, hedging, and derivative agreements may result in the receipt of, or posting of, collateral with counterparties. Fluctuations in commodity prices that lead to the posting of collateral with counterparties negatively impact liquidity, and downgrades in Idaho Power's credit ratings may lead to additional collateral posting requirements. Idaho Power has additional indirect credit exposures to financial institutions in the form of letters of credit provided as security by power suppliers under various purchased power contracts and by vendors for infrastructure development projects. If any of the credit ratings of the letter of credit issuers were to drop below investment grade, the vendor or supplier would need to replace the security with an acceptable substitute, which may be impracticable and may expose Idaho Power to losses resulting from a vendor or supplier default. If the security were not replaced, the party could be in default under the contract and Idaho Power's remedies for default may be inadequate to fully compensate Idaho Power for its losses. Forecasts of future fuel needs and loads and available resources to meet those loads are inherently uncertain and may cause Idaho Power to over- or under-hedge actual resource needs, exposing the company to market risk on the over- or under-hedged position. To the extent that commodity markets are illiquid, Idaho Power may not be able to execute its risk management strategies, which could result in undesired over-exposure to unhedged positions that Idaho Power may not be able to collect in customer rates. The FERC may take action to limit volatility in the energy market by imposing price limits or other market restrictions to control market-based rate sales, which could adversely affect the companies' financial results. As a result, risk management actions, or the failure or inability to manage commodity availability and price and counterparty risk, may adversely affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s financial condition and results of operations. Further, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a counterparty to commodity or other transactions could impair Idaho Power’s ability to collect amounts receivable from those counterparties, potentially including the ability to collect or retain collateral posted by a counterparty. Idaho Power is a participant in the energy markets, including the Western EIM, and engages in direct and indirect power purchase and sale transactions in connection with that participation. The Western EIM has collateral posting requirements based on established credit criteria, but there is no assurance the collateral will be sufficient to cover obligations that counterparties may owe each other in the Western EIM and any such credit losses could be socialized to all Western EIM participants, including Idaho Power. A significant failure of a participant in the Western EIM to make payments when due on its obligations could have a ripple effect on various Idaho Power counterparties in the power, gas, and derivative markets if those counterparties experience ancillary liquidity issues, and could generally result in a decline in the ability of Idaho Power’s counterparties to perform on their obligations.  The performance of pension and postretirement benefit plan investments, increasing health care costs, and other factors impacting plan costs and funding obligations could adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations - primarily cash flows and liquidity. Idaho Power provides a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering most employees, as well as a defined benefit postretirement benefit plan (consisting of health care and death benefits) that covers eligible retirees. Costs of providing these benefits are based in part on the value of the plans' assets and, therefore, adverse investment performance for these assets or the failure to maintain sustained growth in pension investments over time could increase Idaho Power’s plan costs and funding requirements related to the plans. Idaho Power's self-insured costs of health care benefits for eligible employees and retirees have increased in recent years and Idaho Power believes these costs will continue to rise. As benefit costs continue to rise, there is no assurance that the IPUC and OPUC will continue to allow recovery. The key actuarial assumptions that affect pension funding obligations are the expected long-term return on plan assets and the discount rate used in determining future benefit obligations. Idaho Power evaluates the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis, taking into account changes in market conditions, trends, and future expectations. Estimates of future investment market performance, changes in interest rates, and other factors Idaho Power and its actuary firms use to develop the actuarial assumptions are inherently uncertain, and actual results could vary significantly from the estimates. Changes in demographics, including timing of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase Idaho Power's plan costs and funding requirements. Future pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments are also subject to the impacts of changes in legislation. Depending on the timing of contributions to the plans and Idaho Power's ability to recover costs through rates, cash contributions to the plans could reduce the cash available for the companies' businesses and payment of dividends. For additional information regarding Idaho Power's funding obligations under its benefit plans, see Note 12 - ""Benefit Plans"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. If the assumptions underlying coal mine reclamation at Bridger Coal Company and related forecast trust fund growth are materially inaccurate, Idaho Power’s costs could be greater than anticipated or be incurred sooner than anticipated. Bridger Coal Company, a subsidiary of Idaho Power, uses both surface and underground methods to mine coal to be used for power generation at the Jim Bridger power plant. The federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act and state laws and regulations establish operational, reclamation, bonding, and closure obligations and standards for mining of coal. Bridger Coal Company’s estimate of reclamation liability and bonding obligations is reviewed periodically by Idaho Power’s management committee, audit committee of the board of directors, external and internal auditors, and by government regulators. Idaho 30Table of Contents Power funds a trust to cover such projected mine reclamation costs. The trust funds are invested in debt and equity securities and poor performance of these investments would reduce the amount of funds available for their intended purpose, which could require Idaho Power to make additional cash contributions. If actual costs related to those obligations exceed estimates, government regulations relating to those obligations change significantly or unexpected cash funding obligations are required, IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.As a holding company, IDACORP does not have its own operating income and must rely on the cash flows from its subsidiaries to pay dividends and make debt payments. IDACORP is a holding company with no significant operations of its own, and its primary assets are shares or other ownership interests of its subsidiaries, primarily Idaho Power. IDACORP’s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts to IDACORP, whether through dividends, loans, or other means. The ability of IDACORP’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to IDACORP depends on several factors, including each subsidiary's actual and projected earnings and cash flow, capital requirements and general financial condition, regulatory restrictions, tax obligations, covenants contained in credit facilities to which they are parties, and the prior rights of holders of their existing and future first mortgage bonds and other debt or equity securities. Further, the amount and payment of dividends is at the discretion of the board of directors, which may reduce or cease payment of dividends at any time. See Note 7 - ""Common Stock"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a further description of restrictions on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's payment of dividends. General RisksGeneral risks include other risks specific to IDACORP and Idaho Power that are not categorized above.IDACORP's and Idaho Power's activities are concentrated in one industry and in one region, which exposes it to risks from lack of diversification, regional economic conditions, and regional legislation and regulation. IDACORP and Idaho Power do not have diversified operations or sources of revenue. Idaho Power comprises the bulk of IDACORP's operations, and Idaho Power's business is concentrated solely in the electricity industry. Furthermore, Idaho Power's provision of electric service to retail customers is conducted exclusively in its southern Idaho and eastern Oregon service area. As a result, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's future performance, revenues, and collectability of revenues, as well as expenses, will be affected by regional economic conditions, regulatory and legislative activity, weather conditions, and other events and conditions in its service area and in the electric power industry.  The impacts of a retiring workforce with specialized utility-specific functions and the inability to hire qualified third-party vendors could increase costs and adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power’s operations require a skilled workforce to perform specialized utility functions. Many of these positions, such as linemen, grid operators, engineering and design personnel, and generation plant operators, require extensive, specialized training. Idaho Power has experienced in recent years an above-average number of employee retirements and expects the increased level of retirement of its skilled workforce and persons in key positions will continue in 2020 and in the near-term. At December 31, 2019, approximately 22 percent of Idaho Power's employees were eligible for regular or early retirement under Idaho Power's defined benefit pension plan. This will require Idaho Power to attract, train, and retain new employees to help prevent a loss of institutional knowledge and avoid a skills gap. Idaho Power does not have employment contracts with its officers or key employees and cannot guarantee that any member of its management or any key employee at the IDACORP parent or any subsidiary level will continue to serve in any capacity for any particular period of time. The loss of skills and institutional knowledge of experienced employees and the failure to hire and the costs associated with attracting, training, and retaining appropriately qualified employees to replace an aging and skilled workforce could have a negative effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.Idaho Power also hires third-party vendors to assist in performing a variety of ordinary business functions, such as power plant maintenance, data warehousing and management, software development and licensing, electric transmission and distribution operations, billing and metering processes, and vegetation management, among other things. In recent years, Idaho Power has experienced increased competition and rising prices for many forms of third-party vendor services. While Idaho Power does not rely entirely on third-party vendors for many of these business functions, the unavailability of such vendors could adversely affect the quality and cost of Idaho Power's electric service and negatively impact its results of operation.Changes in accounting standards or rules may impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial results and disclosures. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the SEC have made and may continue to make changes to accounting standards that impact presentation and disclosures of financial condition and results of operations. Further, new accounting orders issued by the FERC could significantly impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's reported financial condition. IDACORP and Idaho Power do not have any control over the impact these changes may have on their financial conditions or results of 31Table of Contents operations nor the timing of such changes. Idaho Power meets the requirements under GAAP to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in its financial statements and to defer certain costs as regulatory assets until those costs are collected in rates, and to defer some items as regulatory liabilities. If recovery of these amounts ceases to be probable, if Idaho Power determines that it no longer meets the criteria for applying regulatory accounting, or if accounting rules change to no longer provide for regulatory assets and liabilities, Idaho Power could be required to eliminate some or all of those regulatory assets or liabilities. Any of these circumstances could result in write-offs and have a material effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power’s financial condition and results of operations"
1,IDA,IDACORP INC,2019-02-21,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 19Table of Contents                            IDACORP and Idaho Power operate in a highly regulated industry and business environment that involves significant risks, many of which are beyond the companies' control. The circumstances and factors set forth below may have a material impact on the business, financial condition, or results of operations of IDACORP and Idaho Power and could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in any forward-looking statements. These risk factors, as well as other information in this report, including without limitation, in Part II - Item 7 - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Matters Impacting Future Results"" in this report, and information in other reports the companies file with the SEC, should be considered carefully when making any investment decisions relating to IDACORP or Idaho Power.  State or federal regulators may not approve customer rates that provide timely or sufficient recovery of Idaho Power's costs or allow Idaho Power to earn a reasonable rate of return, which could cause IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations to be adversely affected. The prices that the IPUC and OPUC authorize Idaho Power to charge customers for its retail services, and the tariff rate that the FERC permits Idaho Power to charge for its transmission services, are generally the most significant factors influencing IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s business, results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition. Idaho Power's ability to recover its costs and earn a reasonable rate of return can be affected by many regulatory factors, including the timing difference between when Idaho Power incurs costs and when Idaho Power recovers those costs in customers’ rates (often called ""regulatory lag"" in the utility industry), and differences between the costs included in rates and the amount of actual costs incurred. Idaho Power is often required to incur costs before the IPUC, OPUC, or FERC approves the recovery of those costs, such as construction costs for new facilities or power lines, the costs of compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements, increased funding levels of a defined benefit pension plan, and the costs of damage from fires, weather-related events, and natural disasters. The IPUC, OPUC, and FERC may not allow Idaho Power to recover some or all of those costs on the basis that they find Idaho Power did not reasonably or prudently incur those costs or for other reasons. Ratemaking has generally been premised on estimates of historic costs based on a test year, so if a given year’s actual costs are higher than historic costs, rates may not be sufficient to cover actual costs. While rate regulation is also premised on the assumption that rates established are fair, just, and reasonable, regulators have considerable discretion in applying this standard. Decisions are subject to judicial appeal, which could lead to further uncertainty in regulatory proceedings.Economic, political, legislative, public policy, or regulatory pressures may lead stakeholders to seek rate reductions or refunds, limits on rate increases, or lower allowed rates of return on investments for Idaho Power. The ratemaking process typically involves multiple intervening parties, including governmental bodies, consumer advocacy groups, and customers, generally with the common objective of limiting rate increases or even reducing rates. The IPUC and OPUC may adopt different methods of calculating the allocation of the total utility costs in their respective jurisdictions, resulting in certain costs excluded in both states. In the past, Idaho Power has been denied recovery, or required to defer recovery pending the next general rate case, including denials or deferrals related to capital expenditures for long-term project expenses. Adverse outcomes in regulatory proceedings or significant regulatory lag may cause Idaho Power to record an impairment of its assets or otherwise adversely affect cash flows and earnings and result in lower credit ratings, reduced access to capital and higher financing costs, and reductions or delays in planned capital expenditures.For additional information relating to Idaho Power's state and federal regulatory framework and regulatory matters, see Part I - Item 1 - ""Business - Utility Operations,"" Note 3 - ""Regulatory Matters"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report, and Part II - Item 7 - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Regulatory Matters"" in this report. Idaho Power's cost recovery mechanisms may not function as intended and are subject to change or elimination, which may adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power has power cost adjustment mechanisms in its Idaho and Oregon jurisdictions and a fixed cost adjustment mechanism in Idaho. The power cost adjustment mechanisms track Idaho Power’s actual net power supply costs (primarily fuel and purchased power less wholesale energy sales) and compare these amounts to net power supply costs being recovered in retail rates. A majority of the differences between these two amounts is deferred for future recovery from, or refund to, customers through rates. Volatility in power supply costs continues to be significant, in large part due to fluctuations in hydroelectric generation conditions and high costs for the purchase of renewable energy under mandatory long-term contracts. While the power cost adjustment mechanisms function to mitigate the potentially adverse impact on net income of power supply cost volatility, the mechanisms do not eliminate the cash flow impact of that volatility. When power costs rise above the level recovered in current retail rates, Idaho Power incurs the costs but recovery of those costs is deferred to a subsequent collection period, which can adversely affect Idaho Power’s operating cash flow and liquidity until those costs are recovered from customers. The fixed cost adjustment mechanism is a decoupling mechanism designed to remove a portion of Idaho Power's disincentive to invest in and support 20Table of Contents                            energy efficiency activities. This mechanism allows Idaho Power to charge Idaho residential and small commercial customers when it recovers less than the base level of fixed costs per customer that the IPUC authorized for recovery in the most recent general rate case. The power cost and fixed cost adjustment mechanisms are generally subject to change at the discretion of applicable state regulators, who could decide to modify or eliminate either mechanism in a manner that adversely impacts IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's business, financial condition, and results of operations may be negatively affected by changes in customer growth or customer usage. Changes in the number of customers and customers' use of electricity are affected by a number of factors, such as population growth or decline in Idaho Power's service area, expansion or loss of service area, changes in customer needs and expectations, adoption rates of energy efficiency measures, customer-generated power such as from solar panels and gas-fired generators, demand-side management requirements, regulation or deregulation, and adverse economic conditions. An economic downturn or recession could also negatively impact customer use and reduce revenues and cash flows, thus adversely affecting results of operations. Many electric utilities, including Idaho Power, have experienced a decline in usage per customer, in part attributable to energy efficiency activities. State or federal regulations may be enacted to encourage or require mandatory energy conservation or technological advances that increase energy efficiency, which could further reduce usage per customer. Also, changing customer needs and expectations could lead to lower customer satisfaction, reduced loyalty, difficulty in obtaining rate increases, legislation to deregulate electric service, and customers seeking alternative sources of energy and electric service. If customers choose to generate their own energy, discontinue a portion or all service from Idaho Power, or replace electric power for heating with natural gas, demand for Idaho Power's energy may decline and adversely impact the affordability of its services for remaining customers. While Idaho Power has recently experienced a net growth in usage due to an increase in the number of customers, when adjusted for the impacts of weather, the average monthly usage on a per customer basis for Idaho residential customers has declined from 1,063 kWh in 2009 to 945 kWh in 2018. Rate mechanisms, such as the Idaho fixed cost adjustment, are designed to address the financial disincentive associated with promoting energy efficiency activities, but there is no assurance that the mechanism will result in full or timely collection of Idaho Power's fixed costs, which are currently collected in large part through the company's volume-based energy rates that are based on historical sales volume. Any undercollection of fixed costs would adversely impact revenues, earnings, and cash flows. The formation of municipal utilities or similar entities for distribution systems within Idaho Power's service area could also result in a load decrease. The loss of loads resulting from some of these events may result in IDACORP and Idaho Power modifying or eliminating large generation or transmission projects. This could in turn result in reduced revenues as well as write-downs or write-offs if regulators determine that the costs of the projects were incurred imprudently, which could have a material adverse impact on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Conversely, if Idaho Power were to experience an unanticipated increase in the demand for energy through, for example, the rapid addition of new industrial and commercial customers or population growth in the service area, Idaho Power may be required to rely on higher-cost purchased power to meet peak system demand and may need to accelerate investment in additional generation or transmission resources. If the incremental costs associated with the unanticipated changes in loads exceed the incremental revenue received from the sales to the new customers, and Idaho Power is unable to secure timely and full rate relief to recover those increased costs, the resulting imbalance could have an adverse effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.IDACORP's and Idaho Power's operating results fluctuate seasonally and can be adversely affected by changes in weather conditions, severe weather, and climate change. Idaho Power's electric power sales are seasonal, with demand in Idaho Power's service area peaking during the hot summer months, with a secondary peak during the cold winter months. Electric power demands by irrigation customers in Idaho Power's service area, which are impacted by temperatures and the timing and amount of precipitation, can also create significant seasonal changes in usage. Seasonality of revenues may be further impacted by Idaho Power's tiered rate structure, under which rates charged to customers are often higher during higher-load periods, such as hot summers and cold winters. Market prices for power also often increase significantly during these peak periods, at times when Idaho Power is required to purchase power in the wholesale markets to meet customer demand. By contrast, when temperatures are relatively mild or where precipitation supplants irrigation systems, loads are often lower as customers are not using electricity for heating and air conditioning or irrigation purposes. Thus, weather conditions and the timing and extent of precipitation can cause IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition to fluctuate seasonally, quarterly, and from year to year. Climate change could also have significant physical effects in Idaho Power’s service area, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, lightning, droughts, heat waves, fires, floods, snow loading, and other extreme weather events, and impact Idaho Power’s ability to import power on transmission lines from other geographic areas. These extreme weather events and their associated impacts could damage transmission, distribution, and generation facilities, causing service interruptions and 21Table of Contents                            extended outages, increasing costs and other operating and maintenance expenses, and limiting Idaho Power's ability to meet customer energy demand. Sustained drought conditions or decreased snow pack due to higher temperatures are likely to decrease power generation from hydroelectric plants. Variations in hydroelectric generation that increase Idaho Power's reliance on market purchases may lead to more costly power supply sources for its customers and reduce benefits from selling surplus hydroelectric power in the wholesale market. The price of power in the wholesale energy markets tends to be higher during periods of high regional demand that tends to occur with weather extremes, which may cause Idaho Power to purchase power in the wholesale market during peak price periods, increasing power supply costs. The costs of repair and replacing infrastructure or liability for personal injury, loss of life, or property damage from utility equipment that fails as a result of significant weather and weather-related events, including fires, may not be covered in full by insurance. Costs incurred in connection with such events might also not be recovered through customer rates if the costs incurred are greater than those allowed for recovery by regulators. In addition, state and federal legislation and regulations have been proposed in recent years to limit the severity and impact of climate change, such as imposing mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, which could increase Idaho Power’s compliance costs. For additional information relating to legislation, regulations, and legal proceedings related to environmental matters, see Part II - Item 7 - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Matters"" in this report.New advances in power generation, energy efficiency, or other technologies that impact the power utility industry could cause decreased customer energy demand and decreased revenues. Advances in technology and changes in customer demand and preferences in the electric utility industry have encouraged the development of new technologies for power generation, power storage, and energy efficiency. In particular, in recent years the net cost of solar generation has decreased significantly, and there are federal and state regulations, laws, and other incentives in place to help further reduce the net cost of solar generation. There is potential that customer-owned power generation systems, particularly if coupled with power storage devices, could become sufficiently cost-effective and efficient that an increasing number of Idaho Power's customers choose to install such systems on their homes or businesses, which in turn could require changes in the way Idaho Power manages its distribution systems, and reduce the demand for and sale of energy. Additionally, considerable emphasis has been placed on energy efficiency, such as LED lighting and high-efficiency appliances. Energy efficiency programs, including programs sponsored by Idaho Power under a directive from state regulatory commissions, are designed to reduce energy use and demand. The introduction of new technologies could pose risks in the form of reduced sales and new business models for energy services. If Idaho Power is unable to adjust its rate design or maintain adequate regulatory mechanisms allowing for timely cost recovery, declining usage from customer-owned generation sources and energy efficiency would result in under-recovery of Idaho Power's costs and investment in infrastructure, and reduce revenues, which would impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Acts or threats of terrorism, cyber attacks, data or physical security breaches, and other acts of individuals or groups seeking to disrupt Idaho Power's operations or the electric power grid could require significant expenditures, or result in claims against the companies, and negatively impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power operates in an industry that requires the continuous use and operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. Idaho Power's generation and transmission facilities and its grid operations are potential targets for terrorist acts and threats, as well as cyber attacks and other disruptive activities of individuals or groups, including by nation states or nation state-sponsored groups. Federal regulators have stated that a number of organizations continue to seek opportunities to exploit potential vulnerabilities in the U.S. energy infrastructure and that those attacks have become increasingly frequent and sophisticated. Some of Idaho Power's facilities are deemed ""critical infrastructure,"" in that incapacity or destruction of the facilities could have a debilitating impact on security, reliability or operability of the bulk electric power system, national economic security, and public health and safety. The possibility that infrastructure facilities, such as generation facilities and electric transmission or distribution facilities, would be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror or cyber attack, including by nation states or nation state-sponsored groups (whether originating internally or externally) may affect Idaho Power's operations by limiting the ability to generate, purchase, or transmit power. Cyber threats and attacks can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across networks, information systems, and other technologies. Network, information systems, and technology-related events, including those caused by IDACORP or Idaho Power, such as process breakdowns, human error, security architecture or design vulnerabilities, or by third parties, such as computer hackings, cyber attacks, computer viruses, or other destructive or disruptive software, denial of service attacks, social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing, could result in a degradation or disruption in the energy grid and the services of the companies. Physical or cyber attacks against key suppliers or service providers could have a similar effect on IDACORP and Idaho Power. Political, economic, social, or financial market instability or damage to or interference with Idaho Power’s operating assets, customers, or suppliers may result in business interruptions, lost revenue, higher commodity prices, disruption in fuel supplies, lower energy consumption, and unstable markets, particularly with respect to electricity and natural gas, and increased security, repair, or other costs, any of which may materially adversely affect Idaho Power in ways that cannot be predicted as of the date of this report. Any of these risks could materially affect the companies’ consolidated financial results. 22Table of Contents                            These events, and governmental actions in response, could result in a material decrease in revenues and increase costs to protect, repair, and insure Idaho Power's assets and operate its business.  Idaho Power's operations require the continuous availability of information technology systems and network infrastructure, and in the normal course of business, Idaho Power or its vendors collect and store sensitive and confidential customer and employee information and proprietary information of Idaho Power. No security measures can completely shield Idaho Power's systems, infrastructure, and data from vulnerabilities to cyber attacks, intrusions, or other catastrophic events that could result in their failure or reduced functionality, and ultimately the potential loss of sensitive information or the loss of Idaho Power's ability to fulfill critical business functions and provide reliable electric power to customers. Any security breaches, such as misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in IDACORP's and Idaho Power's information technology systems, including customer data, could result in violations of privacy and other laws, financial loss to Idaho Power or to its customers, customer dissatisfaction, damage to Idaho Power’s reputation, and significant litigation and penalty exposure, all of which could materially affect Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.Capital expenditures for infrastructure, risks associated with permitting and construction of that infrastructure, and the timing and availability of cost recovery for the expenditures, can significantly affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power’s business is capital intensive and requires significant investments in energy generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure. A significant portion of Idaho Power’s facilities were constructed many years ago, and thus require periodic upgrades and frequent maintenance. Also, long-term anticipated increases in both the number of customers and the demand for energy require expansion and reinforcement of that infrastructure. For instance, Idaho Power is in the permitting process for two 500-kV transmission line projects, which are intended to help meet future customer energy demands. Construction projects are subject to usual permitting and construction risks that can adversely affect project costs and the completion time. These risks include, as examples:•the ability to timely obtain labor or materials at reasonable costs;•defaults by suppliers and contractors; •equipment, engineering, and design failures; •unexpected environmental and geological problems;•the effects of adverse weather conditions; •availability of financing; •load forecasts;•the ability to obtain and comply with permits and land use rights, and environmental constraints; and•delays and costs associated with disputes and litigation with third parties. The occurrence of any of these risks could cause Idaho Power to operate at reduced capacity levels, which in turn could reduce revenues, increase expenses, or cause Idaho Power to incur penalties. If Idaho Power is unable or unwilling to complete the permitting or construction of a project, or incurs costs that regulators do not deem prudent, it may be unable to recover its costs in full through rates or on a timely basis. Further, if Idaho Power is unable to secure permits or joint funding commitments to develop transmission infrastructure necessary to serve loads or if other resources become more economical, it may terminate those projects and, as alternatives, seek to develop additional generation facilities within areas where Idaho Power has available transmission capacity or pursue other more costly options to serve loads. To limit the timing-related risks of these projects, Idaho Power may enter into purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals or permits. If any of the projects are canceled for any reason, including Idaho Power's failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals or permits or because the project is no longer economical, Idaho Power could incur significant cancellation penalties under purchase orders or construction contracts. Additionally, termination of a project carries with it the potential for impairment of the associated asset if regulators deny full recovery of project costs. Thus, termination of a project could negatively affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.Changes in legislation, regulation, and government policy may have a material adverse effect on IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s business in the future. Changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, federal, state, and local legislation, regulation, and government policy could significantly impact IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s businesses and the electric utility industry. Specific legislative and regulatory proposals and recently enacted legislation that could have a material impact on IDACORP and Idaho Power include, but are not limited to, tax reform, utility regulation, infrastructure renewal programs, environmental regulation, and modifications to accounting and public company reporting requirements. Further, the proposals and new legislation could have an impact on the rate of growth of Idaho Power’s customers and their willingness to expand operations and increase electric service requirements. Laws, regulations, and policies relating to environmental compliance could change and require IDACORP and Idaho Power and their customers to modify their business strategy or affect their returns on 23Table of Contents                            investment by restricting activities and projects or subjecting them to increased compliance costs. IDACORP and Idaho Power are monitoring the implementation by federal, state, and local governmental authorities of various executive orders and are unable to predict whether and to what extent such actions will meaningfully change existing legislative and regulatory environments relevant to the companies, or if any such changes would have a net positive or negative impact on the companies. To the extent that such changes have a negative impact on the companies or Idaho Power’s customers, including as a result of related uncertainty, these changes may materially and adversely impact IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.Changes in income tax laws and regulations, or differing interpretation or enforcement of applicable laws by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdictions, could have a material adverse impact on IDACORP’s or Idaho Power’s financial condition and results of operations. IDACORP and Idaho Power must make judgments and interpretations about the application of the law when determining the provision for income taxes. Amounts of income tax-related assets and liabilities involve judgments and estimates of the timing and probability of recognition of income, deductions, and tax credits, which are subject to challenge by taxing authorities. In recent years, state regulatory mechanisms with income tax-related provisions (such as Idaho Power's May 2018 regulatory settlement stipulation with the IPUC), has significantly impacted IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations. The outcome of potential future income tax proceedings, or the state public utility commissions' treatment of those outcomes, could differ materially from the amounts IDACORP and Idaho Power record prior to conclusion of those proceedings, and the difference could negatively affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s earnings and cash flows. Further, in some instances, the treatment from a ratemaking perspective of any net income tax expense or benefit could be different than IDACORP or Idaho Power anticipate or request from applicable state regulatory commissions, which could have a negative effect on their financial condition and results of operations. In addition, Idaho Power uses the regulatory flow-through income tax accounting method as described in Note 1 - ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report, and potential changes in income tax laws or interpretations may impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's income taxes and reporting obligations differently than most other companies.IDACORP's and Idaho Power’s businesses are subject to an extensive set of environmental laws, rules, and regulations, which could impact their operations and costs of operations, potentially rendering some generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate, and could increase the costs and alter the timing of major projects. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's operations are subject to a number of federal, state, and local environmental statutes, rules, and regulations relating to air and water quality, natural resources, renewable energy, and health and safety. Many of these laws and regulations are described in Part II - Item 7 - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Matters"" in this report. These laws and regulations generally require IDACORP and Idaho Power to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, and other approvals, including through substantial investment in pollution controls, and may be enforced by both public officials and private individuals. Some of these regulations are pending, changing, or subject to interpretation, and failure to comply may result in penalties, mandatory operational changes, and other adverse consequences, including costs associated with defending against claims by governmental authorities or private parties and complying with new operating requirements. Idaho Power devotes significant resources to environmental monitoring, pollution control equipment, and mitigation projects to comply with existing and anticipated environmental regulations. However, it is possible that federal, state and local authorities could attempt to enforce more stringent standards, stricter regulation, and more expansive application of environmental regulations. Environmental regulations have created the need for Idaho Power to install new pollution control equipment at, and may cause Idaho Power to perform environmental remediation on, its owned and co-owned power generation facilities, often at a substantial cost. Compliance with environmental regulations can significantly increase capital spending, operating costs, and plant outages, and can negatively affect the affordability of Idaho Power's services for customers. Idaho Power cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures necessary to comply with these environmental laws and regulations, although Idaho Power expects the expenditures will be substantial. In some cases, the costs to obtain permits and ensure facilities are in compliance may be prohibitively expensive. If the costs of compliance with new regulations renders the generating facilities uneconomical to maintain or operate, Idaho Power would need to identify alternative resources for power, potentially in the form of new generation and transmission facilities, market power purchases, demand-side management programs, or a combination of these and other methods. Furthermore, Idaho Power may not be able to obtain or maintain all environmental regulatory approvals necessary for operation of its existing infrastructure or construction of new infrastructure.  The current presidential administration has issued a number of executive orders related to environmental matters designed to ease environmental regulation that the federal agencies are still implementing. However, the outcome of the Environmental Protection Agency's and other federal agencies' review of regulations covered by the executive orders is difficult to predict. Moreover, the executive orders and any resulting federal regulations could be affected by Congressional action and challenged in court. Further, state and local governmental authorities could choose to replace the federal regulations or bolster 24Table of Contents                            environmental compliance and enforcement efforts at the local level. Accordingly, Idaho Power may not realize any benefit from changes to federal environmental regulations, if any, resulting from the executive orders and, as of the date of this report, cannot predict whether and to what extent the orders and resulting changes to regulations could affect its operations and environmental-related expenditures. In addition, some environmental regulations are currently subject to litigation and not yet final. As a result of this uncertainty, approaches to comply with the regulations, including available control technologies or other allowed compliance measures, are unpredictable and Idaho Power cannot foresee the potential impacts these regulations would have on Idaho Power's operations or financial condition. Idaho Power is not guaranteed timely or full recovery through customer rates or insurance of costs associated with environmental regulations, environmental compliance, plant closures, or clean-up of contamination. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if Idaho Power fails to obtain, maintain, or comply with any such approval, construction and/or operation of Idaho Power's generation or transmission facilities could be delayed, halted, or subjected to additional costs. Factors contributing to lower hydroelectric generation can increase costs and negatively impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power derives a significant portion of its power supply from its hydroelectric facilities. During 2017 and 2018, 65 percent of Idaho Power's electric power generation was from hydroelectric facilities. Due to Idaho Power’s heavy reliance on hydroelectric generation, factors such as precipitation and snowpack, the timing of run-off, and the availability of water in the Snake River basin can significantly affect its operations. The combination of a long-term trend of declining Snake River base flows, over-appropriation of water, and periods of drought have led to water rights disputes and proceedings among surface water and ground water irrigators and the State of Idaho. Recharging the Eastern Snake Plain aquifer by diverting surface water to porous locations and permitting it to sink into the aquifer is one approach to the over-appropriation dispute. Diversions from the Snake River for aquifer recharge or the loss of water rights reduce Snake River flows available for hydroelectric generation. When hydroelectric generation is reduced, Idaho Power must increase its use of more expensive thermal generating resources and market power purchases; therefore, costs increase and opportunities for wholesale energy sales are reduced, reducing revenues and potentially earnings. Through its power cost adjustment mechanisms, Idaho Power expects to recover most (but not all) of the increase in net power supply costs caused by lower hydroelectric generation. The timing of recovery of the increased costs, however, may not occur until the subsequent power cost adjustment year, adversely affecting cash flows and liquidity.Obligations imposed in connection with hydroelectric license renewals may require large capital expenditures, increase operating costs, reduce hydroelectric generation, and negatively affect IDACORP's or Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition. For the last several years, Idaho Power has been engaged in an effort to renew its federal license for its largest hydroelectric generation source, the Hells Canyon Complex. Relicensing includes an extensive public review process that involves numerous natural resource issues and environmental conditions. The existence of endangered and threatened species in the watershed may result in major operational changes to the region’s hydroelectric projects, which may be reflected in hydroelectric licenses, including for the Hells Canyon Complex. In addition, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to hydroelectric facilities, which could further increase required expenditures for marine life recovery and endangered species protection and reduce the amount of hydroelectric generation available to meet Idaho Power’s generation requirements. One significant issue identified in connection with the Hells Canyon Complex relicensing effort involves water temperature gradients in the Snake River below the Hells Canyon dam. Certain parties in the relicensing proceedings have advocated for the installation of a water temperature management apparatus which, if required to be installed, would involve substantial costs to construct, operate, and maintain. Idaho Power may be unable to recover in full or in a timely manner the costs of such an apparatus through rates, particularly given the magnitude of any potential impact on customer rates. Another significant issue related to the relicensing effort involves a dispute between the states of Idaho and Oregon regarding whether to reintroduce or establish spawning populations of fish species into Idaho waters. In December 2018, the states of Idaho and Oregon, along with Idaho Power, reached a proposed settlement on this matter, requiring Idaho Power to reintroduce certain fish species and fund-related research. Idaho Power cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings, the requirements that might be imposed during the relicensing process, the financial impact of those requirements, whether a new multi-year license will ultimately be issued, and whether the IPUC or OPUC will allow recovery through rates of the substantial costs incurred in connection with the licensing process and subsequent compliance. Imposition of onerous conditions in the relicensing process could result in Idaho Power incurring significant capital expenditures, increase operating costs (including power purchase costs), and reduce hydroelectric generation, which could negatively affect results of operations and financial condition.Idaho Power’s use of coal and natural gas to fuel power generation facilities exposes it to commodity availability and price risk, which can adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition. As part of its normal business operations, Idaho Power purchases coal and natural gas in the open market or under short-term or long-term 25Table of Contents                            contracts, often with variable pricing terms. Market prices for coal and natural gas are volatile and influenced by factors impacting supply and demand such as weather conditions, the adequacy and type of generating capacity, fuel transportation availability, economic conditions, and changes in technology. Natural gas transportation to Idaho Power's three natural gas plants is limited to one primary pipeline, presenting a heightened possibility of supply constraint and disruptions separate from the risk of counterparty default. Most of Idaho Power's coal supply arrangements are under long-term contracts for coal originating in Wyoming, and thus Idaho Power is exposed to risk of disruption of coal production in, or transportation from, that region. Idaho Power may from time to time enter into new, or renegotiate, these long-term contracts but can provide no assurance that such contracts will be negotiated or renegotiated on satisfactory terms, or at all. There also can be no assurance that counterparties to the natural gas or coal supply agreements will fulfill their obligations to supply natural gas or coal, and they may experience financial or technical problems or unforeseeable events that inhibit their ability to deliver natural gas or coal. Disruptions in transportation of fuel and defaults by coal and natural gas suppliers may cause Idaho Power to seek alternative, and potentially more costly, sources of fuel or rely on other generation sources or wholesale market power purchases. Idaho Power may not be able to fully or timely recover these increased costs through rates, which may adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. If the assumptions underlying coal mine reclamation at Bridger Coal Company and related forecast trust fund growth are materially inaccurate, Idaho Power’s costs could be greater than anticipated or be incurred sooner than anticipated. Bridger Coal Company, a subsidiary of Idaho Power, uses both surface and underground methods to mine coal to be used for power generation at the Jim Bridger power plant. The federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act and state laws and regulations establish operational, reclamation, bonding, and closure obligations and standards for mining of coal. Bridger Coal Company’s estimate of reclamation liability and bonding obligations is reviewed periodically by Idaho Power’s management committee, audit committee of the board of directors, external and internal auditors, and by government regulators. Idaho Power funds a trust to cover such projected mine reclamation costs. The trust funds are invested in debt and equity securities and poor performance of these investments would reduce the amount of funds available for their intended purpose, which could require Idaho Power to make additional cash contributions. If actual costs related to those obligations exceed estimates, government regulations relating to those obligations change significantly or unexpected cash funding obligations are required, IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.Idaho Power’s generation, transmission, and distribution facilities are subject to numerous operational risks unique to it and its industry. Operating risks associated with Idaho Power's generation, transmission, and distribution facilities include equipment failures, volatility in fuel and transportation pricing, interruptions in fuel supplies, increased regulatory compliance costs, labor disputes or attrition, accidents and workforce safety matters, release of hazardous or toxic substances into the air, water, or ground, wildfires, acts of terrorism or sabotage, the loss of cost-effective disposal options for solid waste such as coal ash, operator error, and the occurrence of catastrophic events at the facilities. Diminished availability or performance of those facilities could result in reduced customer satisfaction, reputational harm, liability to third parties, and regulatory inquiries and fines. Operation of Idaho Power's owned and co-owned generating stations below expected capacity levels, or unplanned outages at these stations, could cause reduced energy output and lower efficiency levels and result in lost revenues and increased expenses for alternative fuels or wholesale market power purchases. Further, the transmission system in Idaho Power's service area is constrained, limiting the ability to transmit electric energy within the service area and access electric energy from outside the service area during high-load periods. Idaho Power's transmission facilities are also interconnected with those of third parties, and thus operation of Idaho Power's and third parties' facilities could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events. These transmission constraints and events could result in failure to provide reliable service to customers and the inability to deliver energy from generating facilities to the power grid, and the inability to access lower cost sources of electric energy. Idaho Power also enters into agreements with third party contractors to perform work on its generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, and may in some circumstances retain liability for the quality and completion of those contractors’ work, potentially subjecting Idaho Power to penalties, liability for personal injury, loss of life, or property damage, or enforcement actions or liability if a contractor violates applicable laws, rules, regulations, or orders.Accidents, terrorist acts, electrical contacts, fires, explosions, catastrophic failures, general system damage or dysfunction, uncontrolled release of water from hydroelectric dams, and other unplanned events related to Idaho Power's infrastructure would increase repair costs and may expose Idaho Power to liability for personal injury, loss of life, and property damage. Fires alleged to have been caused by Idaho Power's transmission, distribution, or generation infrastructure, or that allegedly result from Idaho Power’s or its contractors’ operating or maintenance practices, could also expose Idaho Power to claims for fire suppression and clean-up costs, evacuation costs, fines and penalties, and liability for economic damages, personal injury, loss of life, and property damage, whether based on claims of negligence, trespass, or otherwise. The risk of wildfires is exacerbated in forested areas where beetle infestations have caused a significant increase in the quantity of standing dead and dying timber, increasing the risk that such trees may fall from either inside or outside our right-of-way into a powerline igniting a fire and increasing the magnitude of fires. A significant number of urban-wildland interfaces in and near Idaho Power's service area, and 26Table of Contents                            commonly hot, dry summer conditions, increase the likelihood and magnitude of damages that may be caused by fires burning into or allegedly originating from utility equipment. Idaho Power maintains insurance coverage for such operating and event risks, but insurance coverage is subject to the terms and limitations of the available policies and may not be sufficient in amount to cover Idaho Power’s ultimate liability. Coverage limits within wildfire insurance policies could result in material self-insured costs in the event there are fires that are deemed to be separate occurrences covered by self-insured retention amounts under the terms of Idaho Power’s insurance policies. Idaho Power or its contractors and customers could also experience coverage reductions and increased wildfire insurance costs in future years. Idaho Power may be unable to fully recover costs in excess of insurance through customer rates or regulatory mechanisms and, even if such recovery is possible, it could take several years to collect. If the amount of insurance is insufficient or otherwise unavailable, and if Idaho Power is unable to fully recover in rates the costs of uninsured losses, IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially affected.Volatility or disruptions in the financial markets, failure of IDACORP or Idaho Power to satisfy conditions necessary for obtaining loans or issuing debt securities, and denial of regulatory authority to issue debt or equity securities, may negatively affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s ability to access capital and/or increase their cost of borrowing and ability to execute on their strategic plans. IDACORP and Idaho Power use credit facilities, commercial paper markets, and long-term debt as significant sources of liquidity and funding for operating and capital requirements and debt maturities not satisfied by operating cash flow. The credit facilities represent commitments by the participating banks to make loans and issue letters of credit. However, the ability and obligation of the participating banks to make those loans and issue letters of credit is subject to specified conditions and volatility or disruptions in the financial markets could affect the companies' ability to obtain debt financing or draw upon or renew existing credit facilities. Idaho Power's ability to issue long-term debt is also subject to a number of conditions included in an indenture, and Idaho Power's ability to issue long-term debt and commercial paper is subject to the availability of purchasers willing to purchase the securities under reasonable terms or at all. Because of these limitations, IDACORP and Idaho Power may be unable to issue commercial paper or short-term or long-term debt at reasonable interest rates and terms or at all. Also, while the credit facilities represent a contractual obligation to make loans, one or more of the participating banks may default on their obligations to make loans under, or may withdraw from, the credit facilities. Idaho Power is required to obtain regulatory approval in Idaho, Oregon, and Wyoming in order to borrow money or to issue securities and is therefore dependent on the public utility commissions of those states to issue favorable orders in a timely manner to permit them to finance their operations, capital expenditures, and debt maturities. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's credit facilities include financial covenants that limit the amount of debt that can be outstanding as a percentage of total capital, and Idaho Power's long-term debt has also been issued under an indenture that contains a number of financial covenants. The companies must also make specified representations in connection with request for loans and it is possible that they may be unable to do so at the time of such request, which would limit or eliminate the obligation of the banks to provide loans. Failure to maintain these representations and covenants could preclude IDACORP and Idaho Power from issuing commercial paper, borrowing under their credit facilities, or issuing long-term debt, and could trigger a default and repayment obligation under debt instruments, which could limit their ability to pursue certain projects and adversely impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.  A downgrade in IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s credit ratings could affect the companies’ ability to access capital, increase their cost of borrowing, and require the companies to post collateral with transaction counterparties. Credit rating agencies periodically review the corporate credit ratings and long-term ratings of IDACORP and Idaho Power. These ratings are premised on financial ratios and performance, the regulatory environment and rate mechanisms, the effectiveness of management, resource risks and power supply costs, and other factors. IDACORP and Idaho Power also have borrowing arrangements that rely on the ability of the banks to fund loans or support commercial paper, a principal source of short-term financing. Downgrades of IDACORP’s or Idaho Power’s credit ratings, or those affecting relationship banks, could limit the companies’ ability to access short- and long-term capital under reasonable terms or at all, reduce the pool of potential lenders, increase borrowing costs under existing credit facilities, limit access to the commercial paper market, require the companies to pay a higher interest rate on their debt, and require the companies to post additional performance assurance collateral with transaction counterparties. If access to capital were to become significantly constrained or costs of capital increased significantly due to lowered credit ratings, prevailing industry conditions, regulatory constraints, the volatility of the capital markets or other factors, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Changes in the method for determining LIBOR and the potential replacement of LIBOR may affect our credit facilities and the interest rates on such borrowings. LIBOR, the London interbank offered rate, is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. The interest rates for any borrowings under IDACORP and Idaho Power’s credit facilities are based on either (1) a floating rate 27Table of Contents                            that is equal to the highest of the prime rate, federal funds rate plus 0.5 percent, or LIBOR rate plus 1.0 percent, or (2) the LIBOR rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin, provided that the federal funds rate and LIBOR rate will not be less than zero percent. In July 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear if at that time LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. If the method for calculation of LIBOR changes, if LIBOR is no longer available, or if lenders have increased costs due to changes in LIBOR, IDACORP and Idaho Power may suffer from potential increases in interest rates on any borrowings. Further, IDACORP and Idaho Power may need to renegotiate their credit facilities that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established.Idaho Power’s risk management policy and programs relating to economically hedging commodity exposures and credit risk may not always perform as intended, and as a result, IDACORP and Idaho Power may suffer economic losses. Idaho Power enters into transactions to buy and sell power, natural gas, and transmission service, enters into transactions to hedge its positions in coal, natural gas, power, and other commodities, and enters into financial hedge transactions to mitigate in part exposure to variable commodity prices. IDACORP and Idaho Power could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market value of these contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform. The derivative instruments used for hedging might not offset the underlying exposure being mitigated as intended, due to pricing inefficiencies or other terms of the derivative instruments, and any such failure to mitigate exposure could result in financial losses. Certain of Idaho Power's purchase or sale, hedging, and derivative agreements may result in the receipt of, or posting of, collateral with counterparties. Fluctuations in commodity prices that lead to the posting of collateral with counterparties negatively impact liquidity, and downgrades in Idaho Power's credit ratings may lead to additional collateral posting requirements. Forecasts of future fuel needs and loads and available resources to meet those loads are inherently uncertain and may cause Idaho Power to over- or under-hedge actual resource needs, exposing the company to market risk on the over- or under-hedged position. To the extent that commodity markets are illiquid, Idaho Power may not be able to execute its risk management strategies, which could result in undesired over-exposure to unhedged positions that Idaho Power may not be able to collect in customer rates. The FERC may take action to limit volatility in the energy market by imposing price limits or other market restrictions to control market-based rate sales, which could adversely affect the companies' financial results. As a result, risk management actions, or the failure or inability to manage commodity availability and price and counterparty risk, may adversely affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s financial condition and results of operations. Further, the bankruptcy or insolvency of a counterparty to commodity or other transactions could impair Idaho Power’s ability to collect amounts receivable from those counterparties, potentially including the ability to collect or retain collateral posted by a counterparty. In January 2019, Pacific Gas & Electric Company and PG&E Corporation, its parent entity (collectively, PG&E), filed voluntary bankruptcy petitions under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Idaho Power does not have any direct power, gas, or derivative transactions with PG&E. However, both Idaho Power and PG&E are participants in the Western EIM and engage in indirect power purchase and sale transactions in connection with that participation. The Western EIM has collateral posting requirements based on established credit criteria, but there is no assurance the collateral will be sufficient to cover obligations that PG&E may owe other participants in the Western EIM. Also, PG&E purchases the output of power from small hydroelectric facilities located in California, in which Ida-West is a 50% co-owner. If PG&E is unable to perform on its obligations under its arrangements with Ida-West’s joint venture, IDACORP does not believe the impact would be material to its financial condition nor results of operations. However, a bankruptcy filing of the magnitude of PG&E’s filing in 2019 could have a ripple effect on various Idaho Power counterparties in the power, gas, and derivative markets if those counterparties experience ancillary liquidity issues, and could generally result in a decline in the ability of Idaho Power’s counterparties to perform on their obligations.  Idaho Power could be subject to penalties and operational changes if it violates mandatory reliability and security requirements, which could adversely impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition. As an owner and operator of a bulk power transmission system, Idaho Power is subject to mandatory reliability and security standards issued by the FERC and other regulators. The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability, security, and market interface principles. Compliance with reliability standards subjects Idaho Power to higher operating costs and increased capital expenditures. Idaho Power has received in recent years notices of violations from, and regularly self-reports reliability standard compliance issues to, the FERC, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and the Western Electricity Coordinating Council. Potential monetary and non-monetary penalties for a violation of FERC regulations may be substantial, and in some circumstances monetary penalties may exceed $1 million per day per violation. The imposition of penalties on Idaho Power for its actual or alleged failure to comply with reliability and security requirements could also have a negative effect on its and IDACORP’s results of operations and financial condition.Federally mandated purchases of power from renewable energy projects, and integration of power generated from those projects into Idaho Power's system, may increase costs and decrease system reliability, and adversely affect Idaho Power's 28Table of Contents                            and IDACORP's results of operations and financial condition. An abundance of intermittent, non-dispatchable generation from renewable energy projects interconnected with Idaho Power's system has had an impact on the operation of Idaho Power's generation plants, system reliability, power supply costs, and the wholesale power markets in the Pacific Northwest. Idaho Power is generally obligated under federal law to purchase power from certain renewable energy projects, regardless of the then-current load demand, availability of lower cost generation resources, or wholesale energy market prices. This increases the likelihood and frequency that Idaho Power will be required to reduce output from its lower-cost hydroelectric and fossil fuel-fired generation resources, which in turn increases power purchase costs and customer rates and impacts Idaho Power's ability to invest in additional generation. Increases in customer rates could make self-generation more financially attractive for customers, which could result in reduced net load and shifts in customer costs. Further, balancing load and generation from Idaho Power's power generation portfolio is challenging, and Idaho Power expects that its operational costs will continue to increase as a result of its efforts to integrate intermittent, non-dispatchable generation from a large number of renewable energy projects. If Idaho Power is unable to timely recover those costs through its power cost adjustment mechanisms or otherwise, those increased costs may negatively affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The performance of pension and postretirement benefit plan investments and other factors impacting plan costs and funding obligations could adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations - primarily cash flows and liquidity. Idaho Power provides a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering most employees, as well as a defined benefit postretirement benefit plan (consisting of health care and death benefits) that covers eligible retirees. Costs of providing these benefits are based in part on the value of the plans' assets and, therefore, adverse investment performance for these assets or the failure to maintain sustained growth in pension investments over time could increase Idaho Power’s plan costs and funding requirements related to the plans. As benefit costs continue to rise, there is no assurance that the state public utility commissions will continue to allow recovery. The key actuarial assumptions that affect funding obligations are the expected long-term return on plan assets and the discount rate used in determining future benefit obligations. Idaho Power evaluates the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis, taking into account changes in market conditions, trends, and future expectations. Estimates of future investment market performance, changes in interest rates, and other factors Idaho Power and its actuary firms use to develop the actuarial assumptions are inherently uncertain, and actual results could vary significantly from the estimates. Changes in demographics, including timing of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase Idaho Power's plan costs and funding requirements. Future pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments are also subject to the impacts of changes in legislation. Depending on the timing of contributions to the plans and Idaho Power's ability to recover costs through rates, cash contributions to the plans could reduce the cash available for the companies' businesses and payment of dividends. For additional information regarding Idaho Power's funding obligations under its benefit plans, see Note 12 - ""Benefit Plans"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. As a holding company, IDACORP does not have its own operating income and must rely on the cash flows from its subsidiaries to pay dividends and make debt payments. IDACORP is a holding company with no significant operations of its own, and its primary assets are shares or other ownership interests of its subsidiaries, primarily Idaho Power. IDACORP’s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts to IDACORP, whether through dividends, loans, or other means. The ability of IDACORP’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to IDACORP depends on several factors, including each subsidiary's actual and projected earnings and cash flow, capital requirements and general financial condition, regulatory restrictions, tax obligations, covenants contained in credit facilities to which they are parties, and the prior rights of holders of their existing and future first mortgage bonds and other debt or equity securities. Further, the amount and payment of dividends is at the discretion of the board of directors, which may reduce or cease payment of dividends at any time. See Note 7 - ""Common Stock"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a further description of restrictions on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's payment of dividends. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's activities are concentrated in one industry and in one region, which exposes it to risks from lack of diversification, regional economic conditions, and regional legislation and regulation. IDACORP and Idaho Power do not have diversified operations or sources of revenue. Idaho Power comprises the bulk of IDACORP's operations, and Idaho Power's business is concentrated solely in the electricity industry. Furthermore, Idaho Power's provision of electric service to retail customers is conducted exclusively in its southern Idaho and eastern Oregon service area. As a result, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's future performance will be affected by economic conditions, regulatory and legislative activity, weather conditions, and other events and conditions in its service area and in the electric power industry.  The impacts of a retiring workforce with specialized utility-specific functions could increase costs and adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power’s operations require a skilled workforce to perform specialized utility functions. Many of these positions, such as linemen, grid operators, engineering and 29Table of Contents                            design personnel, and generation plant operators, require extensive, specialized training. Idaho Power has experienced in recent years an above-average number of employee retirements and expects the increased level of retirement of its skilled workforce and persons in key positions will continue in 2019 and in the near-term. At December 31, 2018, approximately 22 percent of Idaho Power's employees were eligible for regular or early retirement under Idaho Power's defined benefit pension plan. This will require Idaho Power to attract, train, and retain new employees to help prevent a loss of institutional knowledge and avoid a skills gap. The loss of skills and institutional knowledge of experienced employees and the failure to hire and the costs associated with attracting, training, and retaining appropriately qualified employees to replace an aging and skilled workforce could have a negative effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. IDACORP and Idaho Power are subject to costs and other effects of legal and regulatory proceedings, disputes, and claims. From time to time in the normal course of business, IDACORP and Idaho Power are subject to various lawsuits, regulatory proceedings, disputes, and claims that could result in adverse judgments or settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, or other adverse consequences. These matters are subject to a number of uncertainties, and management is often unable to predict the outcome of such matters; resulting liabilities could exceed amounts currently reserved or insured against with respect to such matter. The legal costs and final resolution of matters in which IDACORP or Idaho Power are involved could have reputational impact and a short- or long-term negative effect on their financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, the terms of resolution could require the companies to change their operational practices and procedures, which could also have a negative effect on their financial positions and results of operations.Changes in accounting standards or rules may impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial results and disclosures. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the SEC have made and may continue to make changes to accounting standards that impact presentation and disclosures of financial condition and results of operations. Further, new accounting orders issued by the FERC could significantly impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's reported financial condition. IDACORP and Idaho Power do not have any control over the impact these changes may have on their financial conditions or results of operations nor the timing of such changes. Idaho Power meets conditions under GAAP to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in its financial statements and to defer certain costs as regulatory assets until those costs are collected in rates, and to defer some items as regulatory liabilities. If recovery of these amounts ceases to be probable, if Idaho Power determines that it no longer meets the criteria for applying regulatory accounting, or if accounting rules change to no longer provide for regulatory assets and liabilities, Idaho Power could be required to eliminate some or all of those regulatory assets or liabilities. Any of these circumstances could result in write-offs and have a material effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power’s financial condition and results of operations"
14,IDA,IDACORP INC,2018-02-22,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS IDACORP and Idaho Power operate in a highly regulated industry and business environment that involves significant risks, many of which are beyond the companies' control. The circumstances and factors set forth below may have a material impact on the business, financial condition, or results of operations of IDACORP and Idaho Power and could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in any forward-looking statements. These risk factors, as well as other information in this report, including without limitation, in Part II - Item 7 - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Matters Impacting Future Results"" in this report, and information in other reports the companies file with the SEC, should be considered carefully when making any investment decisions relating to IDACORP or Idaho Power.  State or federal regulators may not approve customer rates that provide timely or sufficient recovery of Idaho Power's costs or allow Idaho Power to earn a reasonable rate of return, which could cause IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations to be adversely affected. The prices that the IPUC and OPUC authorize Idaho Power to charge customers for its retail services, and the tariff rate that the FERC permits Idaho Power to charge for its transmission services, are generally the most significant factors influencing 19Table of Contents IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s business, results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition. Idaho Power's ability to recover its costs and earn a reasonable rate of return can be affected by many regulatory factors, including the timing difference between when costs are incurred and when those costs are recovered in customers’ rates (often called ""regulatory lag"" in the utility industry), and differences between the costs embedded in rates and the amount of actual costs incurred. Idaho Power is often required to incur costs before the IPUC, OPUC, or FERC approves the recovery of those costs, such as construction costs for new facilities or power lines, the costs of compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements and the costs of damage from natural disasters. The IPUC, OPUC, and FERC may not allow Idaho Power to recover some or all of those costs on the basis that Idaho Power did not reasonably or prudently incur those costs or for other reasons. While rate regulation is premised on the assumption that rates established are fair, just, and reasonable, regulators have considerable discretion in applying this standard. Decisions are subject to judicial appeal, which could lead to further uncertainty in regulatory proceedings. In response to economic, political, legislative, public policy, and regulatory pressures, Idaho Power may be subject to rate increase moratoriums, rate reductions or refunds, limits on rate increases, and lower allowed rates of return on investments. The ratemaking process typically involves multiple intervening parties, including governmental bodies, consumer advocacy groups, and customers, generally with the common objective of limiting rate increases or even reducing rates. The IPUC and OPUC may adopt different methods of calculating the allocation of the total utility costs in their respective jurisdictions, resulting in certain costs excluded in both states. In a number of proceedings in recent years, Idaho Power has been denied recovery, or required to defer recovery pending the next general rate case, including denials or deferrals related to capital expenditures for long-term projects expenses. Adverse outcomes in regulatory proceedings or significant regulatory lag may cause Idaho Power to record an impairment of its assets or otherwise adversely affect cash flows and earnings and result in lower credit ratings, reduced access to capital and higher financing costs, and reductions or delays in planned capital expenditures.For additional information relating to Idaho Power's state and federal regulatory framework and regulatory matters, see Part I - Item 1 - ""Business - Utility Operations,"" Note 3 - ""Regulatory Matters"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report, and Part II - Item 7 - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Regulatory Matters"" in this report. Idaho Power's cost recovery mechanisms may not function as intended and are subject to change, which may adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power has power cost adjustment mechanisms in its Idaho and Oregon jurisdictions and a fixed cost adjustment mechanism in Idaho. The power cost adjustment mechanisms track Idaho Power’s actual net power supply costs (primarily fuel and purchased power less off-system sales) and compare these amounts to net power supply costs being recovered in retail rates. A majority of the difference between these two amounts is deferred for future recovery from, or refund to, customers through rates. Volatility in power supply costs continues to be significant, in large part due to fluctuations in hydroelectric generation conditions and high costs for the purchase of renewable energy under mandatory long-term contracts. While the power cost adjustment mechanisms function to mitigate the potentially adverse impact on net income of power supply cost volatility, the mechanisms do not eliminate the cash flow impact of that volatility. When power costs rise above the level recovered in current retail rates, Idaho Power incurs the costs but recovery of those costs is deferred to a subsequent collection period, which can adversely affect Idaho Power’s operating cash flow and liquidity until those costs are recovered from customers. The fixed cost adjustment mechanism is a decoupling mechanism designed to remove Idaho Power's disincentive to invest in energy efficiency activities by allowing Idaho Power to charge residential and small commercial customers when it recovers less than the base level of fixed costs per customer that the IPUC authorized for recovery in the most recent general rate case. The power cost and fixed cost adjustment mechanisms are generally subject to change at the discretion of applicable state regulators, who could decide to modify or eliminate either mechanism in a manner that adversely impacts IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's business, financial condition, and results of operations may be negatively affected by changes in customer growth or customer usage. Growth in the number of customers and customers' use of electricity are affected by a number of factors, such as population growth or decline in Idaho Power's service area, expansion or loss of service area, changes in customer needs and expectations, adoption rates of energy efficiency measures, customer-generated power such as from rooftop solar panels, demand-side management requirements, regulation or deregulation, and adverse economic conditions. An economic downturn or recession could also negatively impact customer use and reduce revenues and cash flows, thus adversely affecting results of operations. Many electric utilities, including Idaho Power, have experienced a decline in usage per customer, in part attributable to energy efficiency activities. State or federal regulations may be enacted to encourage or require mandatory energy conservation or technological advances that increase energy efficiency, which could further reduce usage per customer. Also, changing customer needs and expectations could lead to lower customer satisfaction, reduced loyalty, difficulty in obtaining rate increases, and customers seeking alternative sources of energy and the unbundling of regulated electric service. If customers choose to generate their own energy, discontinue a portion or all service from Idaho Power, or replace electric power for heating with natural gas, demand for Idaho Power's energy may decline and adversely impact the 20Table of Contents affordability of its services for remaining customers. While Idaho Power has recently experienced a net growth in usage due to an increase in the number of customers, when adjusted for the impacts of weather, the average monthly usage on a per customer basis for Idaho residential customers has declined from 1,051 kWh in 2009 to 952 kWh in 2017. Rate mechanisms, such as the Idaho fixed cost adjustment, are designed to address the financial disincentive associated with promoting energy efficiency activities, but there is no assurance that the mechanism will result in full or timely collection of Idaho Power's fixed costs, which are currently collected in large part through the company's volume-based energy rates that are based on historical sales volume. Any undercollection of fixed costs would adversely impact revenues, earnings, and cash flows. The formation of municipal utilities or similar entities for distribution systems within Idaho Power's service area could also result in a load decrease. The loss of loads resulting from some of these events may result in IDACORP and Idaho Power modifying or eliminating large generation or transmission projects. This could in turn result in reduced revenues as well as write-downs or write-offs if regulators determine that the costs of the projects were incurred imprudently, which could have a material adverse impact on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Conversely, if Idaho Power were to experience an unanticipated increase in the demand for energy through, for example, the rapid addition of new industrial and commercial customers or population growth in the service area, Idaho Power may be required to rely on higher-cost purchased power to meet peak system demand and may need to accelerate investment in additional generation or transmission resources. If the incremental costs associated with the unanticipated changes in loads exceed the incremental revenue received from the sales to the new customers, and Idaho Power is unable to secure timely and full rate relief to recover those increased costs, the resulting imbalance could have an adverse effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.IDACORP's and Idaho Power's operating results fluctuate seasonally and can be adversely affected by changes in weather conditions and severe weather. Idaho Power's electric power sales are seasonal, with demand in Idaho Power's service area peaking during the hot summer months, with a secondary peak during the cold winter months. Electric power demands by irrigation customers in Idaho Power's service area, which are impacted by temperatures and the timing and amount of precipitation, can also create significant seasonal changes in usage. Seasonality of revenues may be further impacted by Idaho Power's tiered rate structure, under which rates charged to customers are often higher during higher-load periods, such as hot summers and cold winters. Market prices for power also often increase significantly during these peak periods, at times when Idaho Power is required to purchase power in the wholesale markets to meet customer demand. By contrast, when temperatures are relatively mild or where precipitation supplants irrigation systems, loads are often lower as customers are not using electricity for heating and air conditioning or irrigation purposes. Thus, weather conditions and the timing and extent of precipitation can cause IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition to fluctuate seasonally, quarterly, and from year to year. Changes in climate in Idaho Power's service area could also have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, heat waves, fires, floods, snow loading, and other extreme weather events. These extreme weather events and their associated impacts can damage transmission, distribution, and generation facilities, causing service interruptions and extended outages, increasing supply chain costs and other operating and maintenance expenses, and limiting Idaho Power's ability to meet customer energy demand. Sustained drought conditions or decreased snow pack due to higher temperatures are likely to decrease power generation from hydroelectric plants. Variations in hydroelectric generation that increase Idaho Power's reliance on market purchases may lead to more costly power supply sources for its customers and reduce benefits from selling surplus hydroelectric power in the wholesale market. The price of power in the wholesale energy markets tends to be higher during periods of high regional demand that tends to occur with weather extremes, which may cause Idaho Power to purchase power in the wholesale market during peak price periods, increasing power supply costs. The costs of repair and replacing infrastructure or liability for personal injury or property damage from utility equipment that fails from significant weather and weather-related events may not be covered in full by insurance. Costs incurred as a result of such events might also not be recovered through customer rates if the costs incurred are greater than those allowed for recovery by regulators.New advances in power generation, energy efficiency, or other technologies that impact the power utility industry could decrease revenues. The increasing cost of energy in the electric utility industry has encouraged the development of new technologies for power generation, power storage, and energy efficiency. In particular, in recent years the cost of solar generation has decreased significantly, and there are federal and state regulations, laws and other incentives in place to help further reduce the cost of solar generation. There is potential that customer-owned power generation systems, particularly if coupled with power storage devices, could become sufficiently cost-effective and efficient that an increasing number of Idaho Power's customers choose to install such systems on their homes or businesses, which in turn could require changes in the way Idaho Power manages its distribution systems. Additionally, considerable emphasis has been placed on energy efficiency, such as LED lighting and high-efficiency appliances. Energy efficiency programs, including programs sponsored by Idaho Power 21Table of Contents under a directive from state regulatory commissions, are designed to reduce energy demand. If Idaho Power is unable to adjust its rate design or maintain adequate regulatory mechanisms allowing for timely cost recovery, declining usage from customer-owned generation sources and energy efficiency would result in under-recovery of Idaho Power's costs and investment in infrastructure, and reduce revenues, which would impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Capital expenditures for infrastructure, risks associated with permitting and construction of that infrastructure, and the timing and availability of cost recovery for the expenditures, can significantly affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power’s business is capital intensive and requires significant investments in energy generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure. A significant portion of Idaho Power’s facilities were constructed many years ago, and thus require periodic upgrades and frequent maintenance. Also, long-term anticipated increases in both the number of customers and the demand for energy require expansion and reinforcement of that infrastructure. For instance, Idaho Power is in the permitting process for two 500-kV transmission line projects, which are intended to help meet future customer energy demands. Construction projects are subject to usual permitting and construction risks that can adversely affect project costs and the completion time. These risks include, as examples:•the ability to timely obtain labor or materials at reasonable costs;•defaults by contractors; •equipment, engineering, and design failures; •unexpected environmental and geological problems;•the effects of adverse weather conditions; •availability of financing; •load forecasts;•the ability to obtain and comply with permits and land use rights, and environmental constraints; and•delays and costs associated with disputes and litigation with third parties. The occurrence of any of these risks could cause Idaho Power to operate at reduced capacity levels, which in turn could reduce revenues, increase expenses, or cause Idaho Power to incur penalties. If Idaho Power is unable or unwilling to complete the permitting or construction of a project, or incurs costs that regulators do not deem prudent, it may be unable to recover its costs in full through rates or on a timely basis. Further, if Idaho Power is unable to secure permits or joint funding commitments to develop transmission infrastructure necessary to serve loads or if other resources become more economical, it may terminate those projects and, as alternatives, seek to develop additional generation facilities within areas where Idaho Power has available transmission capacity or pursue other more costly options to serve loads. To limit the timing-related risks of these projects, Idaho Power may enter into purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals or permits. If any of the projects are canceled for any reason, including Idaho Power's failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals or permits or because the project is no longer economical, Idaho Power could incur significant cancellation penalties under purchase orders or construction contracts. Additionally, termination of a project carries with it the potential for impairment of the associated asset if regulators deny full recovery of project costs. Thus, termination of a project could negatively affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.Changes in legislation, regulation, and government policy may have a material adverse effect on IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s business in the future. Changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, federal, state, and local legislation, regulation, and government policy could significantly impact IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s businesses and the electric utility industry. Specific legislative and regulatory proposals and recently enacted legislation that could have a material impact on IDACORP and Idaho Power include, but are not limited to, tax reform, infrastructure renewal programs, and modifications to public company reporting requirements and environmental regulation. Further, the proposals and new legislation could have an impact on the rate of growth of Idaho Power’s customers and their willingness to expand operations and increase electric service requirements. IDACORP and Idaho Power are monitoring the implementation by federal, state, and local governmental authorities of various executive orders and are unable to predict whether and to what extent such actions will meaningfully change existing legislative and regulatory environments relevant to the companies, or if any such changes would have a net positive or negative impact on the companies. To the extent that such changes have a negative impact on the companies or Idaho Power’s customers, including as a result of related uncertainty, these changes may materially and adversely impact IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.Changes in income tax laws and regulations, or differing interpretation or enforcement of applicable laws by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdictions, could have a material adverse impact on IDACORP’s or Idaho Power’s financial condition and results of operations. IDACORP and Idaho Power must make judgments and interpretations 22Table of Contents about the application of the law when determining the provision for income taxes. Amounts of income tax-related assets and liabilities involve judgments and estimates of the timing and probability of recognition of income, deductions, and tax credits, which are subject to challenge by taxing authorities. In recent years, state regulatory mechanisms with income tax-related provisions (such as Idaho Power's October 2014 regulatory settlement stipulation with the IPUC), has significantly impacted IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations. The outcome of ongoing and future income tax proceedings, or the state public utility commissions' treatment of those outcomes, could differ materially from the amounts IDACORP and Idaho Power record prior to conclusion of those proceedings, and the difference could negatively affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s earnings and cash flows. Further, in some instances the treatment from a ratemaking perspective of any net income tax expense or benefit could be different than IDACORP or Idaho Power anticipate or request from applicable state regulatory commissions, which could have a negative effect on their financial condition and results of operations. In addition, Idaho Power uses the regulatory flow-through income tax accounting method as described in Note 1 - ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report, and potential changes in income tax laws or interpretations may impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's income taxes and reporting obligations differently than most other companies.Due to the enactment of the tax reform act generally referred to as the ""Tax Cuts and Jobs Act"", which lowered the corporate federal income tax rate, IDACORP and Idaho Power expect the changes in income tax law to reduce annual income tax expense for both companies beginning in 2018. However, due to Idaho Power's use of flow-through income tax accounting which has historically reduced income tax expense and contributed to lower electricity rates for customers, the changes in federal income tax law may not reduce IDACORP's and Idaho Power's income tax expense as significantly as the income tax expense of some peers in the utility industry who use fully normalized income tax accounting or non-utility companies. The IPUC has ordered Idaho Power to record a regulatory liability for the estimated Idaho-jurisdictional share of financial benefits after January 1, 2018, from the changes in federal income tax law, and to file a report with the IPUC identifying and quantifying the income tax changes along with proposed tariff schedule changes. Idaho Power also filed an application with the OPUC requesting authority to defer for later ratemaking treatment the Oregon jurisdictional earnings in excess of the currently authorized Oregon jurisdictional rate of return on equity that may result from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as measured from the Company’s annual Oregon Results of Operations. The OPUC Staff filed an application with the OPUC requesting authority to defer for later ratemaking treatment the difference between Idaho Power’s current retail rates and its current retail rates inclusive of the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Idaho Power is working with the IPUC and OPUC to determine how potential income tax expense reductions from the changes in federal income tax law may benefit Idaho Power customers and affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. IDACORP's and Idaho Power’s businesses are subject to an extensive set of environmental laws, rules, and regulations, which could impact their operations and costs of operations, potentially rendering some generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate, and could increase the costs and alter the timing of major projects. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's operations are subject to a number of federal, state, and local environmental statutes, rules, and regulations relating to air and water quality, natural resources, renewable energy, and health and safety. Many of these laws and regulations are described in Part II - Item 7 - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Matters"" in this report. These laws and regulations generally require IDACORP and Idaho Power to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, and other approvals, including through substantial investment in pollution controls, and may be enforced by both public officials and private individuals. Some of these regulations are pending, changing, or subject to interpretation, and failure to comply may result in penalties, mandatory operational changes, and other adverse consequences, including costs associated with defending against claims by governmental authorities or private parties and complying with new operating requirements. Idaho Power devotes significant resources to environmental monitoring, pollution control equipment, and mitigation projects to comply with existing and anticipated environmental regulations. However, it is possible that federal, state and local authorities could attempt to enforce more stringent standards, stricter regulation, and more expansive application of environmental regulations. Environmental regulations have created the need for Idaho Power to install new pollution control equipment at, and may cause Idaho Power to perform environmental remediation on, its owned and co-owned power generation facilities, often at a substantial cost. Compliance with environmental regulations can significantly increase capital spending, operating costs and plant outages, and can negatively affect the affordability of Idaho Power's services for customers. Idaho Power cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures necessary to comply with, or as a result of liabilities under, these environmental laws and regulations, although Idaho Power expects the expenditures will be substantial. In some cases, the costs to obtain permits and ensure facilities are in compliance may be prohibitively expensive. If the costs of compliance with new regulations renders the generating facilities uneconomical to maintain or operate, Idaho Power would need to identify alternative resources for power, potentially in the form of new generation and transmission facilities, market power purchases, demand-side management programs, or a combination of these and other methods. Furthermore, Idaho Power may not be able 23Table of Contents to obtain or maintain all environmental regulatory approvals necessary for operation of its existing infrastructure or construction of new infrastructure.  The current presidential administration has issued a number of executive orders related to environmental matters designed to ease environmental regulation that the federal agencies are still implementing. However, the outcome of the Environmental Protection Agency's and other federal agencies' review of regulations covered by the executive orders is difficult to predict. Moreover, the executive orders and any resulting federal regulations could be affected by Congressional action and challenged in court. Further, state and local governmental authorities could choose to replace the federal regulations or bolster environmental compliance and enforcement efforts at the local level. Accordingly, Idaho Power may not realize any benefit from changes to federal environmental regulations, if any, resulting from the executive orders and, as of the date of this report, cannot predict whether and to what extent the orders could affect its operations and environmental-related expenditures. Idaho Power is not guaranteed timely or full recovery through customer rates of costs associated with environmental regulations, environmental compliance, and clean-up of contamination, and regulators may not grant prior approval of cost recovery. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if Idaho Power fails to obtain, maintain, or comply with any such approval, construction and/or operation of Idaho Power's generation or transmission facilities could be delayed, halted, or subjected to additional costs. In addition, some environmental regulations are currently subject to litigation and not yet final. As a result of this uncertainty, strategies to comply with the regulations, including available control technologies or other allowed compliance measures, are unpredictable and Idaho Power cannot provide any assurance regarding the potential impacts these regulations would have on Idaho Power's operations or financial condition. Factors contributing to lower hydroelectric generation can increase costs and negatively impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power derives a significant portion of its power supply from its hydroelectric facilities. During 2017, 65 percent of Idaho Power's electric power generation was from hydroelectric facilities. Due to Idaho Power’s heavy reliance on hydroelectric generation, factors such as precipitation and snowpack, the timing of run-off, and the availability of water in the Snake River basin can significantly affect its operations. The combination of a long-term trend of declining Snake River base flows, over-appropriation of water, and periods of drought have led to water rights disputes and proceedings among surface water and ground water irrigators and the State of Idaho. Recharging the Eastern Snake Plain aquifer by diverting surface water to porous locations and permitting it to sink into the aquifer is one approach to the over-appropriation dispute. Diversions from the Snake River for aquifer recharge or the loss of water rights reduce Snake River flows available for hydroelectric generation. When hydroelectric generation is reduced, Idaho Power must increase its use of more expensive thermal generating resources and market power purchases; therefore, costs increase and opportunities for off-system sales are reduced, reducing revenues and potentially earnings. Through its power cost adjustment mechanisms, Idaho Power expects to recover most (but not all) of the increase in net power supply costs caused by lower hydroelectric generation. The timing of recovery of the increased costs, however, may not occur until the subsequent power cost adjustment year, adversely affecting cash flows and liquidity.Obligations imposed in connection with hydroelectric license renewals may require large capital expenditures, increase operating costs, reduce hydroelectric generation, and negatively affect IDACORP's or Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition. For the last several years, Idaho Power has been engaged in an effort to renew its federal license for its largest hydroelectric generation source, the Hells Canyon Complex. Relicensing includes an extensive public review process that involves numerous natural resource issues and environmental conditions. The existence of endangered and threatened species in the watershed may result in major operational changes to the region’s hydroelectric projects, which may be reflected in hydroelectric licenses, including for the Hells Canyon Complex. In addition, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to hydroelectric facilities, which could further increase required expenditures for marine life recovery and endangered species protection and reduce the amount of hydroelectric generation available to meet Idaho Power’s generation requirements. One significant issue identified in connection with the Hells Canyon Complex relicensing effort involves water temperature gradients in the Snake River below the Hells Canyon dam. Certain parties in the relicensing proceedings have advocated for the installation of a water temperature management apparatus which, if required to be installed, would involve substantial costs to construct, operate, and maintain. Idaho Power may be unable to recover in full or in a timely manner the costs of such an apparatus through rates, particularly given the magnitude of any potential impact on customer rates. Another significant issue related to the relicensing effort involves a dispute between the states of Idaho and Oregon regarding whether to reintroduce or establish spawning populations of fish species into Idaho waters. Idaho Power cannot predict whether and how Idaho and Oregon will negotiate a mutually agreeable approach or whether legal or regulatory action will ultimately be necessary for such resolution, nor can Idaho Power predict the outcome of any such proceedings. Idaho Power also cannot predict the requirements that might be imposed during the relicensing process, the financial impact of those requirements, whether a new multi-year license will ultimately be issued, and whether the IPUC or 24Table of Contents OPUC will allow recovery through rates of the substantial costs incurred in connection with the licensing process and subsequent compliance. Imposition of onerous conditions in the relicensing process could result in Idaho Power incurring significant capital expenditures, increase operating costs (including power purchase costs), and reduce hydroelectric generation, which could negatively affect results of operations and financial condition.Idaho Power’s use of coal and natural gas to fuel power generation facilities exposes it to commodity availability and price risk, which can adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition. As part of its normal business operations, Idaho Power purchases coal and natural gas in the open market or under short-term or long-term contracts, often with variable pricing terms. Market prices for coal and natural gas are volatile and influenced by factors impacting supply and demand such as weather conditions, fuel transportation availability, economic conditions, and changes in technology. Natural gas transportation to Idaho Power's three natural gas plants is limited to one primary pipeline, presenting a heightened possibility of supply constraint and disruptions separate from the risk of counterparty default. Most of Idaho Power's coal supply arrangements are under long-term contracts for coal originating in Wyoming, and thus Idaho Power is exposed to risk of disruption of coal production in, or transportation from, that region. Idaho Power may from time to time enter into new, or renegotiate, these long-term contracts but can provide no assurance that such contracts will be negotiated or renegotiated on satisfactory terms, or at all. There also can be no assurance that counterparties to the natural gas or coal supply agreements will fulfill their obligations to supply natural gas or coal, and they may experience financial or technical problems or unforeseeable events that inhibit their ability to deliver natural gas or coal. Defaults by coal and natural gas suppliers may cause Idaho Power to seek alternative, and potentially more costly, sources of fuel or rely on other generation sources or wholesale market power purchases. Idaho Power may not be able to fully or timely recover these increased costs through rates, which may adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. If the assumptions underlying coal mine reclamation at Bridger Coal Company and related forecast trust fund growth are materially inaccurate, Idaho Power’s costs could be greater than anticipated or be incurred sooner than anticipated. Bridger Coal Company, a subsidiary of Idaho Power, uses both surface and underground methods to mine coal to be used for power generation at the Jim Bridger power plant. The federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act and state laws and regulations establish operational, reclamation, bonding, and closure obligations and standards for mining of coal. Bridger Coal Company’s estimate of reclamation liability and bonding obligations is reviewed periodically by Idaho Power’s management committee and by government regulators. Idaho Power funds a trust to cover such projected mine reclamation costs. The trust funds are invested in debt and equity securities and poor performance of these investments would reduce the amount of funds available for their intended purpose, which could require Idaho Power to make additional cash contributions. If actual costs related to those obligations exceed estimates, government regulations relating to those obligations change significantly or unexpected cash funding obligations are required, IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.Idaho Power’s generation, transmission, and distribution facilities are subject to numerous operational risks unique to it and its industry. Operating risks associated with Idaho Power's generation, transmission, and distribution facilities include equipment failures, volatility in fuel and transportation pricing, interruptions in fuel supplies, increased regulatory compliance costs, labor disputes, accidents and workforce safety matters, release of hazardous or toxic substances into the air, water, or ground, wildfires, acts of terrorism or sabotage, the loss of cost-effective disposal options for solid waste such as coal ash, operator error, and the occurrence of catastrophic events at the facilities. Diminished availability or performance of those facilities could result in reduced customer satisfaction, reputational harm, liability to third parties, and regulatory inquiries and fines. Operation of Idaho Power's owned and co-owned generating stations below expected capacity levels, or unplanned outages at these stations, could cause reduced energy output and lower efficiency levels and result in lost revenues and increased expenses for alternative fuels or wholesale market power purchases. Further, the transmission system in Idaho Power's service area is constrained, limiting the ability to transmit electric energy within the service area and access electric energy from outside the service area during high-load periods. Idaho Power's transmission facilities are also interconnected with those of third parties, and thus operation of Idaho Power's and third parties' facilities could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events. These transmission constraints and events could result in failure to provide reliable service to customers and the inability to deliver energy from generating facilities to the power grid, and the inability to access lower cost sources of electric energy. Accidents, electrical contacts, fires, explosions, catastrophic failures, general system damage or dysfunction, uncontrolled release of water from hydroelectric dams, and other unplanned events related to Idaho Power's infrastructure would increase repair costs and may expose Idaho Power to liability for personal injury and property damage. Fires alleged to have been caused by Idaho Power's transmission, distribution, or generation infrastructure could also expose Idaho Power to claims for fire suppression costs and liability for personal injury or property damage, whether based on claims of negligence, trespass or otherwise. Idaho Power maintains insurance coverage for such operating and event risks, but insurance coverage is subject to 25Table of Contents the terms and limitations of the available policies and may not be sufficient to cover Idaho Power’s ultimate liability. If the amount of insurance is insufficient or otherwise unavailable, or if Idaho Power is unable to recover in rates the costs of any uninsured losses, IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially affected. Volatility or disruptions in the financial markets, failure of IDACORP or Idaho Power to satisfy conditions necessary for obtaining loans or issuing debt securities, and denial of regulatory authority to issue debt or equity securities may negatively affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s ability to access capital and/or increase their cost of borrowing, and ability to execute on their strategic plans. IDACORP and Idaho Power use credit facilities, commercial paper markets, and long-term debt as significant sources of liquidity and funding for operating and capital requirements and debt maturities not satisfied by operating cash flow. The credit facilities represent commitments by the participating banks to make loans and issue letters of credit. However, the ability and obligation of the participating banks to make those loans and issue letters of credit is subject to specified conditions and volatility or disruptions in the financial markets could affect the companies' ability to obtain debt financing or draw upon or renew existing credit facilities. Idaho Power's ability to issue long-term debt is also subject to a number of conditions included in an indenture, and Idaho Power's ability to issue long-term debt and commercial paper is subject to the availability of purchasers willing to purchase the securities under reasonable terms or at all. Because of these limitations, IDACORP and Idaho Power may be unable to issue commercial paper or short-term or long-term debt at reasonable interest rates and terms or at all. Also, while the credit facilities represent a contractual obligation to make loans, one or more of the participating banks may default on their obligations to make loans under, or may withdraw from, the credit facilities. Idaho Power is required to obtain regulatory approval in Idaho, Oregon, and Wyoming in order to borrow money or to issue securities and is therefore dependent on the public utility commissions of those states to issue favorable orders in a timely manner to permit them to finance their operations, capital expenditures, and debt maturities. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's credit facilities include financial covenants that limit the amount of debt that can be outstanding as a percentage of total capital, and Idaho Power's long-term debt has also been issued under an indenture that contains a number of financial covenants. The companies must also make specified representations in connection with request for loans and it is possible that they may be unable to do so at the time of such request, which would limit or eliminate the obligation of the banks to provide loans. Failure to maintain these representations and covenants could preclude IDACORP and Idaho Power from issuing commercial paper, borrowing under their credit facilities, or issuing long-term debt, and could trigger a default and repayment obligation under debt instruments, which could limit their ability to pursue certain projects and adversely impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.  A downgrade in IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s credit ratings could affect the companies’ ability to access capital, increase their cost of borrowing, and require the companies to post collateral with transaction counterparties. Credit rating agencies periodically review the corporate credit ratings and long-term ratings of IDACORP and Idaho Power. These ratings are premised on financial ratios and performance, the regulatory environment and rate mechanisms, the effectiveness of management, resource risks and power supply costs, and other factors. IDACORP and Idaho Power also have borrowing arrangements that rely on the ability of the banks to fund loans or support commercial paper, a principal source of short-term financing. Downgrades of IDACORP’s or Idaho Power’s credit ratings, or those affecting relationship banks, could limit the companies’ ability to access short- and long-term capital under reasonable terms or at all, reduce the pool of potential lenders, increase borrowing costs under existing credit facilities, limit access to the commercial paper market, require the companies to pay a higher interest rate on their debt, and require the companies to post additional performance assurance collateral with transaction counterparties. If access to capital were to become significantly constrained or costs of capital increased significantly due to lowered credit ratings, prevailing industry conditions, regulatory constraints, the volatility of the capital markets or other factors, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Idaho Power’s risk management policy and programs relating to economically hedging commodity exposures and credit risk may not always perform as intended, and as a result, IDACORP and Idaho Power may suffer economic losses. Idaho Power enters into transactions to hedge its positions in coal, natural gas, power, and other commodities, and enters into financial hedge transactions to mitigate in part exposure to variable commodity prices. IDACORP and Idaho Power could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market value of these contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform. The derivative instruments used for hedging might not offset the underlying exposure being mitigated as intended, due to pricing inefficiencies or other terms of the derivative instruments, and any such failure to mitigate exposure could result in financial losses. Certain of Idaho Power's hedging and derivative agreements may result in the receipt of, or posting of, collateral with counterparties. Fluctuations in commodity prices that lead to the posting of collateral with counterparties negatively impact liquidity, and downgrades in Idaho Power's credit ratings may lead to additional collateral posting requirements. Further, forecasts of future fuel needs and loads and available resources to meet those loads are inherently uncertain and may cause Idaho Power to over- 26Table of Contents or under-hedge actual resource needs, exposing the company to market risk on the over- or under-hedged position. To the extent that commodity markets are illiquid, Idaho Power may not be able to execute its risk management strategies, which could result in undesired over-exposure to unhedged positions. As a result, risk management actions, or the failure or inability to manage commodity price and counterparty risk, may adversely affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power could be subject to penalties and operational changes if it violates mandatory reliability and security requirements, which could adversely impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition. As an owner and operator of a bulk power transmission system, Idaho Power is subject to mandatory reliability and security standards issued by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and enforced by the FERC. The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles. Compliance with reliability standards subjects Idaho Power to higher operating costs and increased capital expenditures. Idaho Power has received in recent years notices of violations from, and regularly self-reports reliability standard compliance issues to, the FERC, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and the Western Electricity Coordinating Council. Potential monetary and non-monetary penalties for a violation of FERC regulations may be substantial, and in some circumstances monetary penalties may be as high as $1 million per day per violation. The FERC may take action to limit volatility in the energy market by imposing price limits or other market restrictions to control market-based rate sales, which could adversely affect the companies' financial results. The imposition of penalties on Idaho Power for its actual or alleged failure to comply with reliability and security requirements could also have a negative effect on its and IDACORP’s results of operations and financial condition. Federally mandated purchases of power from renewable energy projects, and integration of power generated from those projects into Idaho Power's system, may increase costs and decrease system reliability, and adversely affect Idaho Power's and IDACORP's results of operations and financial condition. An abundance of intermittent, non-dispatchable generation from renewable energy projects interconnected with Idaho Power's system has had an impact on the operation of Idaho Power's generation plants, system reliability, power supply costs, and the wholesale power markets in the Pacific Northwest. Idaho Power is generally obligated under federal law to purchase power from certain renewable energy projects, regardless of the then-current load demand, availability of lower cost generation resources, or wholesale energy market prices. This increases the likelihood and frequency that Idaho Power will be required to reduce output from its lower-cost hydroelectric and fossil fuel-fired generation resources, which in turn increases power purchase costs and customer rates and impacts Idaho Power's ability to invest in additional generation. Increases in customer rates could make self-generation more financially attractive for customers, which could result in reduced net load and shifts in customer costs. Further, balancing load and generation from Idaho Power's power generation portfolio is challenging, and Idaho Power expects that its operational costs will continue to increase as a result of its efforts to integrate intermittent, non-dispatchable generation from a large number of renewable energy projects. If Idaho Power is unable to timely recover those costs through its power cost adjustment mechanisms or otherwise, those increased costs may negatively affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The performance of pension and postretirement benefit plan investments and other factors impacting plan costs and funding obligations could adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations - primarily cash flows and liquidity. Idaho Power provides a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering most employees, as well as a defined benefit postretirement benefit plan (consisting of health care and death benefits) that covers eligible retirees. Costs of providing these benefits are based in part on the value of the plans' assets and, therefore, adverse investment performance for these assets or the failure to maintain sustained growth in pension investments over time could increase Idaho Power’s plan costs and funding requirements related to the plans. As benefit costs continue to rise, there is no assurance that the state public utility commissions will continue to allow recovery. The key actuarial assumptions that affect funding obligations are the expected long-term return on plan assets and the discount rate used in determining future benefit obligations. Idaho Power evaluates the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis, taking into account changes in market conditions, trends, and future expectations. Estimates of future equity and debt market performance, changes in interest rates, and other factors Idaho Power and its actuary firms use to develop the actuarial assumptions are inherently uncertain, and actual results could vary significantly from the estimates. Changes in demographics, including timing of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase Idaho Power's plan costs and funding requirements. Future pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments are also subject to the impacts of changes in legislation. Depending on the timing of contributions to the plans and Idaho Power's ability to recover costs through rates, cash contributions to the plans could reduce the cash available for the companies' businesses and payment of dividends. For additional information regarding Idaho Power's funding obligations under its benefit plans, see Note 11 - ""Benefit Plans"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. 27Table of Contents As a holding company, IDACORP does not have its own operating income and must rely on the cash flows from its subsidiaries to pay dividends and make debt payments. IDACORP is a holding company with no significant operations of its own, and its primary assets are shares or other ownership interests of its subsidiaries, primarily Idaho Power. IDACORP’s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts to IDACORP, whether through dividends, loans, or other means. The ability of IDACORP’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to IDACORP depends on several factors, including each subsidiary's actual and projected earnings and cash flow, capital requirements and general financial condition, regulatory restrictions, tax obligations, covenants contained in credit facilities to which they are parties, and the prior rights of holders of their existing and future first mortgage bonds and other debt or equity securities. Further, the amount and payment of dividends is at the discretion of the board of directors, which may reduce or cease payment of dividends at any time. See Note 6 - ""Common Stock"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a further description of restrictions on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's payment of dividends. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's activities are concentrated in one industry and in one region, which exposes it to risks from lack of diversification, regional economic conditions, and regional legislation and regulation. IDACORP and Idaho Power do not have diversified operations or sources of revenue. Idaho Power comprises the bulk of IDACORP's operations, and Idaho Power's business is concentrated solely in the electricity industry. Furthermore, Idaho Power's provision of electric service to retail customers is conducted exclusively in its southern Idaho and eastern Oregon service area. As a result, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's future performance will be affected by economic conditions, regulatory and legislative activity, and other events in its service area and in the electric power industry.  The impacts of a retiring workforce with specialized utility-specific functions could increase costs and adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power’s operations require a skilled workforce to perform specialized utility functions. Many of these positions, such as linemen, grid operators, engineering and design personnel, and generation plant operators, require extensive, specialized training. Idaho Power has experienced in recent years an above-average number of employee retirements and expects the increased level of retirement of its skilled workforce and persons in key positions will continue in 2018 and in the near-term. At December 31, 2017, approximately 23 percent of Idaho Power's employees were eligible for regular or early retirement under Idaho Power's defined benefit pension plan. This will require Idaho Power to attract, train, and retain new employees to help prevent a loss of institutional knowledge and avoid a skills gap. The loss of skills and institutional knowledge of experienced employees and the failure to hire and the costs associated with attracting, training, and retaining appropriately qualified employees to replace an aging and skilled workforce could have a negative effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. IDACORP and Idaho Power are subject to costs and other effects of legal and regulatory proceedings, disputes, and claims. From time to time in the normal course of business, IDACORP and Idaho Power are subject to various lawsuits, regulatory proceedings, disputes, and claims that could result in adverse judgments or settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, or other adverse consequences. These matters are subject to a number of uncertainties, and management is often unable to predict the outcome of such matters; resulting liabilities could exceed amounts currently reserved or insured against with respect to such matter. The legal costs and final resolution of matters in which IDACORP or Idaho Power are involved could have reputational impact and a short- or long-term negative effect on their financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, the terms of resolution could require the companies to change their operational practices and procedures, which could also have a negative effect on their financial positions and results of operations.Acts or threats of terrorism, cyber attacks, data or physical security breaches, and other acts of individuals or groups seeking to disrupt Idaho Power's operations or the electric power grid could require significant expenditures, or result in claims against the companies, and negatively impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power operates in an industry that requires the continuous use and operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. Idaho Power's generation and transmission facilities and its grid operations are potential targets for terrorist acts and threats, as well as cyber attacks and other disruptive activities of individuals or groups. Some of Idaho Power's facilities are deemed ""critical infrastructure,"" in that incapacity or destruction of the facilities could have a debilitating impact on security, reliability or operability of the bulk electric power system, national economic security, and public health and safety. The possibility that infrastructure facilities, such as generation facilities and electric transmission facilities, would be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror or cyber attack (whether originating internally or externally) may affect Idaho Power's operations by limiting the ability to generate, purchase, or transmit power. Cyber threats and attacks can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across networks, information systems and other technologies. Network, information systems and technology-related events, including those caused by us, such as process breakdowns, security architecture or design vulnerabilities, or by third parties, such as computer hackings, cyber attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing, or power outages, natural disasters, infectious disease 28Table of Contents outbreaks, terrorist attacks or other similar events, could result in a degradation or disruption of the products and services of the companies. These events, and governmental actions in response, could result in a material decrease in revenues and increase costs to protect, repair, and insure Idaho Power's assets and operate its business.  Federal regulators have stated that a number of organizations continue to seek opportunities to exploit potential vulnerabilities in the U.S. energy infrastructure and that those attacks have become increasingly sophisticated. Attacks on Idaho Power's infrastructure could result from acts of those organizations or other third parties as well as Idaho Power employees or contractors. At the same time, Idaho Power's energy infrastructure is becoming more reliant on network-based infrastructure. Idaho Power's operations require the continuous availability of information technology systems and network infrastructure, and in the normal course of business, Idaho Power collects sensitive and confidential customer and employee information and proprietary information of Idaho Power. Although Idaho Power actively monitors developments in cyber security, no security measures can completely shield Idaho Power's systems, infrastructure, and data from vulnerabilities to cyber attacks, intrusions, or other catastrophic events that could result in their failure or reduced functionality, and ultimately the potential loss of sensitive information or the loss of Idaho Power's ability to fulfill critical business functions and provide reliable electric power to customers. Any security breaches, such as misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in IDACORP's and Idaho Power's information technology systems, including customer data, could result in violations of privacy and other laws, financial loss to Idaho Power or to its customers, customer dissatisfaction, and significant litigation and penalty exposure, all of which could materially affect Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.Changes in accounting standards or rules may impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial results and disclosures. The Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC may make changes to accounting standards that impact presentation and disclosures of financial condition and results of operations. Further, new accounting orders issued by the FERC could significantly impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's reported financial condition. Idaho Power meets conditions under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in its financial statements and to defer certain costs as regulatory assets until those costs are collected in rates, and to defer some items as regulatory liabilities. If recovery of these amounts ceases to be probable, if Idaho Power determines that it no longer meets the criteria for applying regulatory accounting, or if accounting rules change to no longer provide for regulatory assets and liabilities, Idaho Power could be required to eliminate some or all of those regulatory assets or liabilities. Any of these circumstances could result in write-offs and have a material effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power’s financial condition and results of operations"
5,IDA,IDACORP INC,2017-02-23,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS IDACORP and Idaho Power operate in a highly regulated industry and business environment that involves significant risks, many of which are beyond the companies' control.  The circumstances and factors set forth below may have a material impact on the business, financial condition, or results of operations of IDACORP and Idaho Power and could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in any forward-looking statements.  These risk factors, as well as other information in this report and in other reports the companies file with the SEC, should be considered carefully when making any investment decisions relating to IDACORP or Idaho Power.   If state public utility commissions or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission authorize retail or transmission customer rates that under-collect or delay the collection through customer rates of the amount Idaho Power needs to cover costs and earn a reasonable rate of return, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.  The prices that the IPUC and OPUC authorize Idaho Power to charge customers for its retail services, and the tariff rate that the FERC permits Idaho Power to charge for its transmission services, are generally the most significant factors influencing IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s business, results of operations, and financial condition.  Idaho Power's ability to recover its costs and earn a reasonable rate of return can be affected by many regulatory factors, including the timing difference between when costs are incurred and when those costs are recovered in customers’ rates (often called ""regulatory lag"" in the utility industry), and differences between the costs embedded in rates and the amount of actual costs incurred.  Idaho Power is often required to incur costs before the IPUC, OPUC, or FERC approves the recovery of those costs, and the IPUC, OPUC, and FERC may not allow Idaho Power to recover some or all of those costs on the basis that Idaho Power did not reasonably or prudently incur those costs or for other reasons.  While rate regulation is premised on the assumption that rates established are fair, just, and reasonable, regulators have considerable discretion in applying this standard.  In response to economic, political, legislative, public policy, and regulatory pressures, Idaho Power may be subject to rate increase moratoriums, rate reductions or refunds, limits on rate increases, and lower allowed rates of return on investments.  The ratemaking process typically involves multiple intervening parties, including governmental bodies, consumer advocacy groups, and customers, generally with the common objective of limiting rate increases or even reducing rates.  Denial or probable denial of recovery by regulators may cause Idaho Power to record an impairment of its assets.  In a number of proceedings in recent years, Idaho Power has been denied recovery, or required to defer recovery pending the next general rate case, including denials or deferrals related to compensation expenses.  Adverse outcomes in regulatory proceedings or significant regulatory lag may adversely affect cash flows and earnings and result in lower credit ratings, reduced access to capital and higher financing costs, and reductions or delays in planned capital expenditures.For additional information relating to Idaho Power's regulatory framework and regulatory matters, see Part I - Item 1 - ""Business - Utility Operations,"" Note 3 - ""Regulatory Matters"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report, 19Table of contents                                and Part II - Item 7 - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Regulatory Matters"" in this report. Idaho Power's cost recovery mechanisms may not function as intended and are subject to change, which may adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  Idaho Power has power cost adjustment mechanisms in its Idaho and Oregon jurisdictions and a fixed cost adjustment mechanism in Idaho.  The power cost adjustment mechanisms track Idaho Power’s actual net power supply costs (primarily fuel and purchased power less off-system sales) and compare these amounts to net power supply costs being recovered in retail rates.  A majority of the difference between these two amounts is deferred for future recovery from, or refund to, customers through rates.  In recent years, the volatility in power supply costs has been significant, in large part due to fluctuations in hydroelectric generation conditions and high costs for the purchase of renewable energy under mandatory long-term contracts.  While the power cost adjustment mechanisms function to mitigate the potentially adverse impact on net income of power supply cost volatility, the mechanisms do not eliminate the cash flow impact of that volatility.  When power costs rise above the level recovered in current retail rates, Idaho Power incurs the costs but recovery of those costs is deferred to a subsequent collection period, which can adversely affect Idaho Power’s operating cash flow and liquidity until those costs are recovered from customers.  The fixed cost adjustment mechanism is a decoupling mechanism designed to remove Idaho Power's disincentive to invest in energy efficiency activities by allowing Idaho Power to charge residential and small commercial customers when it recovers less than the base level of fixed costs per customer that the IPUC authorized for recovery in the most recent general rate case.  The power cost and fixed cost adjustment mechanisms are generally subject to change at the discretion of applicable state regulators, who could decide to modify or eliminate either mechanism in a manner that adversely impacts IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's business, financial condition, and results of operations may be negatively affected by changes in customer growth or customer usage.  Growth in the number of customers and customers' use of electricity are affected by a number of factors, such as population growth or decline in Idaho Power's service area, weak economic conditions, expansion or loss of service area, changes in customer needs and expectations, adoption rates of energy efficiency measures, customer-generated power such as from rooftop solar panels, demand-side management requirements, and economic conditions.  Many electric utilities, including Idaho Power, have experienced a decline in usage per customer, in part attributable to energy efficiency activities. State or federal regulations may be enacted to require mandatory energy conservation or technological advances that increase energy efficiency, which could further reduce usage per customer.  Also, changing customer needs and expectations could lead to lower customer satisfaction, reduced loyalty, difficulty in obtaining rate increases, and customers seeking alternative sources of energy.  If customers choose to generate their own energy or replace electric power for heating with natural gas, demand for Idaho Power's energy may decline and adversely impact the affordability of our services for remaining customers. While Idaho Power has recently experienced a net growth in usage due to an increase in the number of customers, when adjusted for the impacts of weather, the average monthly usage on a per customer basis for Idaho residential customers has declined from 1,051 kWh in 2009 to 954 kWh in 2016.  Rate mechanisms, such as the Idaho fixed cost adjustment, are designed to address the financial disincentive associated with promoting energy efficiency activities, but there is no assurance that the mechanism will result in full or timely collection of Idaho Power's fixed costs, which are currently collected in large part through the company's kWh energy rates that are based on historical sales volume.  Any undercollection of fixed costs would adversely impact revenues, earnings, and cash flows.  The formation of municipal utilities or similar entities for distribution systems within Idaho Power's service area could also result in a load decrease.  The loss of loads resulting from some of these events may result in IDACORP and Idaho Power modifying or eliminating large generation or transmission projects.  This could in turn result in reduced revenues as well as write-downs or write-offs if regulators determine that the costs of the projects were incurred imprudently, which could have a material adverse impact on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.  Conversely, if Idaho Power were to experience an unanticipated increase in the demand for energy through, for example, the rapid addition of new industrial and commercial customers, Idaho Power may be required to rely on higher-cost purchased power to meet peak system demand and may need to accelerate investment in additional generation or transmission resources.  If the incremental costs associated with the unanticipated changes in loads exceed the incremental revenue received from the sales to the new customers, and Idaho Power is unable to secure timely and full rate relief to recover those increased costs, the resulting imbalance could have an adverse effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.  IDACORP's and Idaho Power's operating results fluctuate seasonally and can be adversely affected by changes in weather conditions and severe weather, including as a result of climate change.  Idaho Power's electric power sales are seasonal, with demand in Idaho Power's service area peaking during the hot summer months, with a secondary peak during the cold winter months.  Electric power demands by irrigation customers in Idaho Power's service area, which are impacted by temperatures 20Table of contents                                and the timing and amount of precipitation, among other factors, can also create significant seasonal changes in usage.  Seasonality of revenues may be further impacted by Idaho Power's tiered rate structure, under which rates charged to customers are often higher during higher-load periods.  Market prices for power also often increase significantly during these peak periods, at times when Idaho Power is required to purchase power in the wholesale markets to meet customer demand.  By contrast, when temperatures are relatively mild or where precipitation supplants irrigation systems, loads are often lower as customers are not using electricity for heating and air conditioning or irrigation purposes.  Thus, weather conditions and the timing and extent of precipitation can cause IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition to fluctuate seasonally, quarterly, and from year to year. Some scientists have predicted that increasing concentrations of GHG in the earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events.  If such effects were to occur, Idaho Power's operations could be adversely affected and its cost of providing service could increase.  Extreme weather events and their associated impacts (such as fires, high winds, and snow loading) can damage generation facilities and disrupt transmission and distribution systems, causing service interruptions and extended outages through downed transmission and distribution lines, increasing supply chain costs and limiting Idaho Power's ability to meet customer energy demand.  Sustained drought conditions are likely to decrease power generation from hydroelectric plants.  The effect of the failure of Idaho Power's facilities to operate as planned under extreme weather conditions is particularly burdensome during peak demand periods, such as hot summer days.  Damage and disruption in generation, transmission, and distribution systems due to weather-related factors also often increases O&M expenses.  Costs incurred as a result of such events might not be recovered through customer rates if the costs incurred are greater than those allowed for recovery by regulators, and the costs of repair and replacing infrastructure or liability for personal injury or property damage may not be covered in full by insurance. New advances in power generation, energy efficiency, or other technologies that impact the power utility industry could decrease revenues. The increasing cost of energy in the electric utility industry has encouraged the development of new technologies for power generation, power storage, and energy efficiency.  In particular, in recent years the cost of solar generation has decreased significantly, and there are federal tax incentives in place to help further reduce the cost of solar generation.  There is potential that customer-owned power generation systems, particularly if coupled with power storage devices, could become sufficiently cost-effective and efficient that an increasing number of Idaho Power's customers choose to install such systems on their homes or businesses.  Additionally, considerable emphasis has been placed on energy efficiency, such as LED lighting and high-efficiency appliances.  Energy efficiency programs, including programs sponsored by Idaho Power under a directive from state regulatory commissions, are designed to reduce energy demand.  If Idaho Power is unable to adjust its rate design or maintain adequate regulatory mechanisms allowing for timely cost recovery, declining usage from customer-owned generation sources and energy efficiency would result in under-recovery of Idaho Power's costs and reduce revenues, which would impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Capital expenditures for infrastructure, risks associated with permitting and construction of that infrastructure, and the timing and availability of cost recovery for the expenditures, can significantly affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  Idaho Power’s business is capital intensive and requires significant investments in energy generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure.  A significant portion of Idaho Power’s facilities were constructed many years ago, and thus require periodic upgrades and frequent maintenance.  Also, long-term anticipated increases in both the number of customers and the demand for energy require expansion and reinforcement of that infrastructure.  For instance, Idaho Power is in the permitting process for two 500-kV transmission line projects, which are intended to help meet future customer energy demands.  Construction projects are subject to usual permitting and construction risks that can adversely affect project costs and the completion time.  These risks include, as examples:•the ability to timely obtain labor or materials at reasonable costs;•defaults by contractors; •equipment, engineering, and design failures; •unexpected environmental and geological problems;•the effects of adverse weather conditions; •availability of financing; •the ability to obtain and comply with permits and land use rights, and environmental constraints; and•delays and costs associated with disputes and litigation with third parties. The occurrence of any of these risks could cause Idaho Power to operate at reduced capacity levels, which in turn could reduce revenues, increase expenses, or cause Idaho Power to incur penalties. If Idaho Power is unable or unwilling to complete the permitting or construction of a project, or incurs costs that regulators do not deem prudent, it may be unable to recover its costs 21Table of contents                                in full through rates or on a timely basis.  Further, if Idaho Power is unable to secure permits or joint funding commitments to develop transmission infrastructure necessary to serve loads or if other resources become more economical, it may terminate those projects and, as alternatives, seek to develop additional generation facilities within areas where Idaho Power has available transmission capacity or pursue other more costly options to serve loads.  To limit the timing-related risks of these projects, Idaho Power may enter into purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals or permits.  If any of the projects are canceled for any reason, including Idaho Power's failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals or permits or because the project is no longer economical, Idaho Power could incur significant cancellation penalties under purchase orders or construction contracts.  Additionally, termination of a project carries with it the potential for impairment of the associated asset if regulators deny full recovery of project costs.  Thus, termination of a project could negatively affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.Changes in legislation, regulation, and government policy as a result of the 2016 U.S. presidential and congressional elections may have a material adverse effect on IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s business in the future.  The recent presidential and congressional elections in the United States could result in significant changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation, and government policy. While it is not possible to predict whether and when any such changes will occur, they could significantly impact IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s businesses and the electric utility industry. Specific legislative and regulatory proposals discussed during and after the election that could have a material impact on IDACORP and Idaho Power include, but are not limited to, reform of the federal tax code; infrastructure renewal programs; and modifications to public company reporting requirements and environmental regulation.  Further, the proposals could have an impact on the rate of growth of Idaho Power’s customers and their willingness to expand operations and increase electric service requirements.  IDACORP and Idaho Power are unable to predict whether reform discussions will meaningfully change existing legislative and regulatory environments relevant to the companies, or if any such changes would have a net positive or negative impact on the companies.  To the extent that such changes have a negative impact on the companies or Idaho Power’s customers, including as a result of related uncertainty, these changes may materially and adversely impact IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.IDACORP's and Idaho Power’s businesses are subject to an extensive set of environmental laws, rules, and regulations, which could impact their operations and costs of operations, potentially rendering some generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate, and could increase the costs and alter the timing of major projects.  A number of federal, state, and local environmental statutes, rules, and regulations relating to air and water quality, natural resources, renewable energy certificates, and health and safety are applicable to IDACORP's and Idaho Power's operations.  Many of these laws and regulations are described in Part II - Item 7 - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Matters"" in this report.  These laws and regulations generally require IDACORP and Idaho Power to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, and other approvals, including through substantial investment in pollution controls, and may be enforced by both public officials and private individuals.  Some of these regulations are pending, changing, or subject to interpretation, and failure to comply may result in penalties, mandatory operational changes, and other adverse consequences, including costs associated with defending against claims by governmental authorities or private parties and complying with new operating requirements.  Idaho Power devotes significant resources to environmental monitoring, pollution control equipment, and mitigation projects to comply with existing and anticipated environmental regulations.  However, it is possible that federal, state and local authorities could attempt to enforce more stringent standards, stricter regulation, and more expansive application of environmental regulations.  Environmental regulations have created the need for Idaho Power to install new pollution control equipment at, and may cause Idaho Power to perform environmental remediation on, its owned and co-owned power generation facilities, often at a substantial cost.  For instance, Idaho Power recently installed environmental control apparatus in two units of its co-owned Jim Bridger power plant at a cost of $100 million, excluding AFUDC. Due to uncertainties resulting from pending environmental regulation and the substantial estimated cost of installing similar controls on the remaining two units, Idaho Power is assessing whether to move forward with the remaining installations. Compliance with environmental regulations can significantly increase capital spending, operating costs and plant outages, and can negatively affect the affordability of Idaho Power's services for customers. Idaho Power cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures necessary to comply with, or as a result of liabilities under, these environmental laws and regulations, although Idaho Power expects the expenditures will be substantial.  In some cases, the costs to obtain permits and ensure facilities are in compliance may be prohibitively expensive.  If the costs of compliance with new regulations renders the generating facilities uneconomical to maintain or operate, Idaho Power would need to identify alternative resources for power, potentially in the form of new generation and transmission facilities, market power purchases, demand-side management programs, or a combination of these and other methods.  Furthermore, Idaho Power may not be able to obtain or maintain all environmental regulatory approvals necessary for operation of its existing infrastructure or construction of new infrastructure.  22Table of contents                                Idaho Power is not guaranteed timely or full recovery through customer rates of costs associated with environmental regulations, environmental compliance, and clean-up of contamination, and regulators may not grant prior approval of cost recovery.  For example, in 2013, the IPUC declined to approve Idaho Power's application requesting a binding commitment to provide rate base treatment for Idaho Power's estimated share of the capital investment in environmental control upgrades at the Jim Bridger power plant, instead reserving the prudence determination (and thus ratemaking treatment) for subsequent proceedings.  If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if Idaho Power fails to obtain, maintain, or comply with any such approval, construction and/or operation of Idaho Power's generation or transmission facilities could be delayed, halted, or subjected to additional costs. In addition, some environmental regulations are currently subject to litigation and not yet final, such as the EPA’s proposed regulations to reduce CO2 emissions as described in Part II - Item 7 - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Matters"" in this report.  As a result of this uncertainty, strategies to comply with the regulations, including available control technologies or other allowed compliance measures, are unpredictable and Idaho Power cannot provide any assurance regarding the potential impacts these regulations would have on Idaho Power's operations or financial condition. Factors contributing to lower hydroelectric generation can increase costs and negatively impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  Idaho Power derives a significant portion of its power supply from its hydroelectric facilities.  During 2016, 53 percent of Idaho Power's electric power generation was from hydroelectric facilities.  Because of Idaho Power’s heavy reliance on hydroelectric generation, factors such as precipitation and snowpack, the timing of run-off, and the availability of water in the Snake River basin can significantly affect its operations.  The combination of a long-term trend of declining Snake River base flows, over-appropriation of water, and periods of drought have led to water rights disputes and proceedings among surface water and ground water irrigators and the State of Idaho.  Recharging the Eastern Snake Plain aquifer by diverting surface water to porous locations and permitting it to sink into the aquifer is one approach to the over-appropriation dispute.  Diversions from the Snake River for aquifer recharge or the loss of water rights reduce Snake River flows available for hydroelectric generation.  When hydroelectric generation is reduced, Idaho Power must increase its use of more expensive thermal generating resources and market power purchases; therefore, costs increase and opportunities for off-system sales are reduced, reducing revenues and potentially earnings.  Through its power cost adjustment mechanisms, Idaho Power expects to recover most (but not all) of the increase in net power supply costs caused by lower hydroelectric generation.  The timing of recovery of the increased costs, however, may not occur until the subsequent power cost adjustment year, adversely affecting cash flows and liquidity.Obligations imposed in connection with hydroelectric license renewals may require large capital expenditures, increase operating costs, reduce hydroelectric generation, and negatively affect IDACORP's or Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition.  For the last several years, Idaho Power has been engaged in an effort to renew its federal license for its largest hydroelectric generation source, the Hells Canyon Complex.  Relicensing includes an extensive public review process that involves numerous natural resource issues and environmental conditions.  The existence of endangered and threatened species in the watershed may result in major operational changes to the region’s hydroelectric projects, which may be reflected in hydroelectric licenses, including for the Hells Canyon Complex.  In addition, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to hydroelectric facilities, which could further increase required expenditures for marine life recovery and endangered species protection and reduce the amount of hydroelectric generation available to meet Idaho Power’s generation requirements.  One particularly significant issue identified in connection with the Hells Canyon Complex relicensing effort involves water temperature gradients in the Snake River below the Hells Canyon dam.  Certain parties in the relicensing proceedings have advocated for the installation of a water temperature management apparatus which, if required to be installed, would involve substantial costs to construct, operate, and maintain.  Idaho Power may be unable to recover in full or in a timely manner the costs of such an apparatus through rates, particularly given the magnitude of any potential impact on customer rates.  Idaho Power also cannot predict the requirements that might be imposed during the relicensing process, the financial impact of those requirements, whether a new multi-year license will ultimately be issued, and whether the IPUC or OPUC will allow recovery through rates of the substantial costs incurred in connection with the licensing process and subsequent compliance.  Imposition of onerous conditions in the relicensing process could result in Idaho Power incurring significant capital expenditures, increase operating costs (including power purchase costs), and reduce hydroelectric generation, which could negatively affect results of operations and financial condition.Idaho Power’s use of coal and natural gas to fuel power generation facilities exposes it to commodity availability and price risk, which can adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition.  As part of its normal business operations, Idaho Power purchases coal and natural gas in the open market or under short-term or long-term contracts, often with variable pricing terms.  Market prices for coal and natural gas are influenced by factors impacting supply 23Table of contents                                and demand such as weather conditions, fuel transportation availability, economic conditions, and changes in technology.  Natural gas transportation to Idaho Power's three natural gas plants is limited to one primary pipeline, presenting a heightened possibility of supply constraint and disruptions separate from the risk of counterparty default.  Most of Idaho Power's coal supply arrangements are under long-term contracts for coal originating in Wyoming, and thus Idaho Power is exposed to risk of disruption of coal production in, or transportation from, that region.  Idaho Power may from time to time enter into new, or renegotiate, these long-term contracts but can provide no assurance that such contracts will be negotiated or renegotiated on satisfactory terms, or at all.  There also can be no assurance that counterparties to the natural gas or coal supply agreements will fulfill their obligations to supply natural gas or coal, and they may experience financial or technical problems that inhibit their ability to deliver natural gas or coal.  Defaults by coal and natural gas suppliers may cause Idaho Power to seek alternative, and potentially more costly, sources of fuel or rely on other generation sources or wholesale market power purchases.  Idaho Power may not be able to fully or timely recover these increased costs through rates, which may adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. If the assumptions underlying coal mine reclamation at Bridger Coal Company and related forecast trust fund growth are materially inaccurate, Idaho Power’s costs could be greater than anticipated or be incurred sooner than anticipated.  Bridger Coal Company, a subsidiary of Idaho Power, uses both surface and underground methods to mine coal to be used for power generation at the Jim Bridger power plant.  The federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act and state laws and regulations establish operational, reclamation, bonding, and closure obligations and standards for mining of coal. Bridger Coal Company’s estimate of reclamation liability and bonding obligations is reviewed periodically by Idaho Power’s management committee and by government regulators.  Idaho Power funds a trust to cover such projected mine reclamation costs.  The trust funds are invested in debt and equity securities and poor performance of these investments would reduce the amount of funds available for their intended purpose, which could require Idaho Power to make additional cash contributions.  If actual costs related to those obligations exceed estimates, government regulations relating to those obligations change significantly or unexpected cash funding obligations are required, IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.Idaho Power’s generation, transmission, and distribution facilities are subject to numerous operational risks unique to it and its industry.  Operating risks associated with Idaho Power's generation, transmission, and distribution facilities include equipment failures, volatility in fuel and transportation pricing, interruptions in fuel supplies, increased regulatory compliance costs, labor disputes, accidents and workforce safety matters, release of hazardous or toxic substances into the air, water, or ground, wildfires, acts of terrorism or sabotage, the loss of cost-effective disposal options for solid waste such as coal ash, operator error, and the occurrence of catastrophic events at the facilities.  Diminished availability or performance of those facilities could result in reduced customer satisfaction, reputational harm, and regulatory inquiries and fines.  Operation of Idaho Power's owned and co-owned generating stations below expected capacity levels, or unplanned outages at these stations, could cause reduced energy output and lower efficiency levels and result in lost revenues and increased expenses for alternative fuels or wholesale market power purchases.  Further, the transmission system in Idaho Power's service area is constrained, limiting the ability to transmit electric energy within the service area and access electric energy from outside the service area during high-load periods.  Idaho Power's transmission facilities are also interconnected with those of third parties, and thus operation of Idaho Power's and third parties' facilities could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events.  These transmission constraints and events could result in failure to provide reliable service to customers and the inability to deliver energy from generating facilities to the power grid, or not being able to access lower cost sources of electric energy.   Accidents, electrical contacts, fires, explosions, catastrophic failures, general system damage or dysfunction, and other unplanned events related to Idaho Power's infrastructure would increase repair costs and may expose Idaho Power to claims for personal injury and property damage, interest, and attorneys' fees.  Fires alleged to have been caused by Idaho Power's system could also expose Idaho Power to claims for fire suppression costs and claims related to fires based on claims of negligence, trespass or otherwise.  Idaho Power maintains insurance coverage for such operating and event risks, but insurance coverage is subject to the terms and limitations of the available policies and may not be sufficient to cover Idaho Power’s ultimate liability.  Idaho Power is also subject to the risk that insurers and other parties will dispute, or be unable to perform, their obligations to Idaho Power with respect to such claims, which could have an adverse effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.       Volatility in the financial markets, failure of IDACORP or Idaho Power to satisfy conditions necessary for obtaining loans or issuing debt securities, and denial of regulatory authority to issue debt or equity securities may negatively affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s ability to access capital and/or increase their cost of borrowing.  IDACORP and Idaho Power use credit facilities, commercial paper markets, and long-term debt as significant sources of liquidity and funding for operating and capital requirements and debt maturities not satisfied by operating cash flow.  The credit facilities represent commitments by the participating banks to make loans and issue letters of credit.  However, the obligation of the participating 24Table of contents                                banks to make those loans and issue letters of credit is subject to specified conditions.  Idaho Power's ability to issue long-term debt is also subject to a number of conditions included in an indenture, and Idaho Power's ability to issue long-term debt and commercial paper is subject to the availability of purchasers willing to purchase the securities under reasonable terms or at all.  Because of these limitations, IDACORP and Idaho Power may be unable to issue commercial paper or short-term or long-term debt at reasonable interest rates and terms or at all.  Also, while the credit facilities represent a contractual obligation to make loans, one or more of the participating banks may default on their obligations to make loans under, or may withdraw from, the credit facilities. Idaho Power is required to obtain regulatory approval in Idaho, Oregon, and Wyoming in order to borrow money or to issue securities and is therefore dependent on the public utility commissions of those states to issue favorable orders in a timely manner to permit them to finance their operations, capital expenditures, and debt maturities.  Without additional state regulatory approval, as of the date of this report the aggregate amount of short-term borrowings by Idaho Power at any one time outstanding may not exceed $450 million.  Also, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's credit facilities include financial covenants that limit the amount of debt that can be outstanding as a percentage of total capital, and Idaho Power's long-term debt has also been issued under an indenture that contains a number of financial covenants.  Failure to maintain these covenants could preclude IDACORP and Idaho Power from issuing commercial paper, borrowing under their credit facilities, or issuing long-term debt, and could trigger a default and repayment obligation under debt instruments, which could adversely impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.   A downgrade in IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s credit ratings could affect the companies’ ability to access capital, increase their cost of borrowing, and require the companies to post collateral with transaction counterparties.  Credit rating agencies periodically review the corporate credit ratings and long-term ratings of IDACORP and Idaho Power.  These ratings are premised on financial ratios and performance, the regulatory environment and rate mechanisms, the effectiveness of management, resource risks and power supply costs, and other factors.  IDACORP and Idaho Power also have borrowing arrangements that rely on the ability of the banks to fund loans or support commercial paper, a principal source of short-term financing.  Downgrades of IDACORP’s or Idaho Power’s credit ratings, or those affecting relationship banks, could limit the companies’ ability to access short- and long-term capital under reasonable terms or at all, reduce the pool of potential lenders, increase borrowing costs under existing credit facilities, limit access to the commercial paper market, require the companies to pay a higher interest rate on their debt, and require the companies to post additional performance assurance collateral with transaction counterparties.  If access to capital were to become significantly constrained or costs of capital increased significantly due to lowered credit ratings, prevailing industry conditions, regulatory constraints, the volatility of the capital markets or other factors, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Idaho Power’s risk management policy and programs relating to economically hedging commodity exposures and credit risk may not always perform as intended, and as a result, IDACORP and Idaho Power may suffer economic losses.  Idaho Power enters into transactions to hedge its positions in coal, natural gas, power, and other commodities, and enters into financial hedge transactions to mitigate in part exposure to variable commodity prices.  IDACORP and Idaho Power could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market value of these contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform.  The derivative instruments used for hedging might not offset the underlying exposure being mitigated as intended, due to pricing inefficiencies or other terms of the derivative instruments, and any such failure to mitigate exposure could result in financial losses.  Certain of Idaho Power's hedging and derivative agreements may result in the receipt of, or posting of, collateral with counterparties.  Fluctuations in commodity prices that lead to the posting of collateral with counterparties negatively impact liquidity, and downgrades in Idaho Power's credit ratings may lead to additional collateral posting requirements.  Further, forecasts of future fuel needs and loads and available resources to meet those loads are inherently uncertain and may cause Idaho Power to over- or under-hedge actual resource needs, exposing the company to market risk on the over- or under-hedged position.  To the extent that commodity markets are illiquid, Idaho Power may not be able to execute its risk management strategies, which could result in undesired over-exposure to unhedged positions.  As a result, risk management actions, or the failure or inability to manage commodity price and counterparty risk, may adversely affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s financial condition and results of operations.  Idaho Power could be subject to penalties and operational changes if it violates mandatory reliability and security requirements, which could adversely impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition.  As an owner and operator of a bulk power transmission system, Idaho Power is subject to mandatory reliability and security standards issued by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and enforced by the FERC.  The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles.  Compliance with reliability standards subjects Idaho Power to higher operating costs and increased capital expenditures.  Idaho Power has received in recent years notices of violations from, and regularly self-reports reliability 25Table of contents                                standard compliance issues to, the FERC, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and the Western Electricity Coordinating Council.  Potential monetary and non-monetary penalties for a violation of FERC regulations may be substantial, and in some circumstances monetary penalties may be as high as $1 million per day per violation.  The imposition of penalties on Idaho Power for its actual or alleged failure to comply with reliability and security requirements could have a negative effect on its and IDACORP’s results of operations and financial condition.    Federally mandated purchases of power from renewable energy projects, and integration of power generated from those projects into Idaho Power's system, may increase costs and decrease system reliability, and adversely affect Idaho Power's and IDACORP's results of operations and financial condition.  An abundance of intermittent, non-dispatchable generation from renewable energy projects interconnected with Idaho Power's system has had an impact on the operation of Idaho Power's generation plants, system reliability, power supply costs, and the wholesale power markets in the Pacific Northwest.  Idaho Power is generally obligated under federal law to purchase power from certain renewable energy projects, regardless of the then-current load demand, availability of lower cost generation resources, or wholesale energy market prices.  This increases the likelihood and frequency that Idaho Power will be required to reduce output from its lower-cost hydroelectric and fossil fuel-fired generation resources, which in turn increases power purchase costs and customer rates.  Increases in customer rates could make self-generation more financially attractive for customers, which could result in reduced net load and shifts in customer costs.  Further, balancing load and generation from Idaho Power's power generation portfolio is challenging, and Idaho Power expects that its operational costs will continue to increase as a result of its efforts to integrate intermittent, non-dispatchable generation from a large number of renewable energy projects.  If Idaho Power is unable to timely recover those costs through its power cost adjustment mechanisms or otherwise, those increased costs may negatively affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The performance of pension and postretirement benefit plan investments and other factors impacting plan costs and funding obligations could adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations - primarily cash flows and liquidity.  Idaho Power provides a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering most employees, as well as a defined benefit postretirement benefit plan (consisting of health care and death benefits) that covers eligible retirees.  Costs of providing these benefits are based in part on the value of the plans' assets and, therefore, adverse investment performance for these assets could increase Idaho Power’s plan costs and funding requirements related to the plans.  As benefit costs continue to rise, there is no assurance that the state public utility commissions will continue to allow recovery. The key actuarial assumptions that affect funding obligations are the expected long-term return on plan assets and the discount rate used in determining future benefit obligations.  Idaho Power evaluates the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis, taking into account changes in market conditions, trends, and future expectations.  Estimates of future equity and debt market performance, changes in interest rates, and other factors Idaho Power and its actuary firms use to develop the actuarial assumptions are inherently uncertain, and actual results could vary significantly from the estimates.  Changes in demographics, including timing of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase Idaho Power's plan costs and funding requirements.  Future pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments are also subject to the impacts of changes in legislation.  Depending on the timing of contributions to the plans and Idaho Power's ability to recover costs through rates, cash contributions to the plans could reduce the cash available for the companies' businesses and payment of dividends.  For additional information regarding Idaho Power's funding obligations under its benefit plans, see Note 11 - ""Benefit Plans"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.   As a holding company, IDACORP does not have its own operating income and must rely on the cash flows from its subsidiaries to pay dividends and make debt payments.  IDACORP is a holding company with no significant operations of its own, and its primary assets are shares or other ownership interests of its subsidiaries, primarily Idaho Power.  IDACORP’s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts to IDACORP, whether through dividends, loans, or other means.  The ability of IDACORP’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to IDACORP depends on several factors, including each subsidiary's actual and projected earnings and cash flow, capital requirements and general financial condition, regulatory restrictions, covenants contained in credit facilities to which they are parties, and the prior rights of holders of their existing and future first mortgage bonds and other debt or equity securities.  Further, the amount and payment of dividends is at the discretion of the board of directors, which may reduce or cease payment of dividends at any time.  See Note 6 - ""Common Stock"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a further description of restrictions on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's payment of dividends. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's activities are concentrated in one industry and in one region, which exposes it to risks from lack of diversification, regional economic conditions, and regional legislation and regulation.  IDACORP and Idaho Power do not have diversified operations or sources of revenue.  Idaho Power comprises the bulk of IDACORP's operations, and Idaho Power's business is concentrated solely in the electricity industry.  Furthermore, Idaho Power's provision of electric service to retail customers is conducted exclusively in its southern Idaho and eastern Oregon service area.  As a result, IDACORP's and 26Table of contents                                Idaho Power's future performance will be affected by economic conditions, regulatory and legislative activity, and other events in its service area and in the electric power industry.  The impacts of a retiring workforce with specialized utility-specific functions could increase costs and adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  Idaho Power’s operations require a skilled workforce to perform specialized utility functions.  Many of these positions, such as linemen, grid operators, engineering and design personnel, and generation plant operators, require extensive, specialized training.  Idaho Power has experienced in recent years an above-average number of employee retirements and expects the increased level of retirement of its skilled workforce and persons in key positions will continue in 2017 and in the near-term.  At December 31, 2016, approximately 23 percent of Idaho Power's employees were eligible for regular or early retirement under Idaho Power's defined benefit pension plan.  This will require Idaho Power to attract, train, and retain new employees to help prevent a loss of institutional knowledge and avoid a skills gap.  The loss of skills and institutional knowledge of experienced employees and the costs associated with attracting, training, and retaining appropriately qualified employees to replace an aging and skilled workforce could have a negative effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. IDACORP and Idaho Power are subject to costs and other effects of legal and regulatory proceedings, disputes, and claims.  From time to time in the normal course of business, IDACORP and Idaho Power are subject to various lawsuits, regulatory proceedings, disputes, and claims that could result in adverse judgments or settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, or other adverse consequences.  These matters are subject to a number of uncertainties, and management is often unable to predict the outcome of such matters; resulting liabilities could exceed amounts currently reserved or insured against with respect to such matter.  The legal costs and final resolution of matters in which IDACORP or Idaho Power are involved could have a negative effect on their financial condition and results of operations.  Similarly, the terms of resolution could require the companies to change their operational practices and procedures, which could also have a negative effect on their financial positions and results of operations.Acts or threats of terrorism, cyber attacks, data or physical security breaches, and other acts of individuals or groups seeking to disrupt Idaho Power's operations or the electric power grid could negatively impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  Idaho Power operates in an industry that requires the continuous use and operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure.  Idaho Power's generation and transmission facilities and its grid operations are potential targets for terrorist acts and threats, as well as cyber attacks and other disruptive activities of individuals or groups.  Some of Idaho Power's facilities are deemed ""critical infrastructure,"" in that incapacity or destruction of the facilities could have a debilitating impact on security, reliability or operability of the bulk electric power system, national economic security, and public health and safety.  The possibility that infrastructure facilities, such as generation facilities and electric transmission facilities, would be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror or cyber attack (whether originating internally or externally) may affect Idaho Power's operations by limiting the ability to generate, purchase, or transmit power.  These events, and governmental actions in response, could result in a material decrease in revenues and increase costs to protect, repair, and insure Idaho Power's assets and operate its business.  Federal regulators have stated that a number of organizations continue to seek opportunities to exploit potential vulnerabilities in the U.S. energy infrastructure and that those attacks have become increasingly sophisticated.  Attacks on Idaho Power's infrastructure could result from acts of those organizations or other third parties as well as Idaho Power employees or contractors.  At the same time, Idaho Power's energy infrastructure is becoming more reliant on network-based infrastructure.  Idaho Power's operations require the continuous availability of information technology systems and network infrastructure, and in the normal course of business, Idaho Power collects sensitive and confidential customer and employee information and proprietary information of Idaho Power.  Although Idaho Power actively monitors developments in cyber security, no security measures can completely shield Idaho Power's systems, infrastructure, and data from vulnerabilities to cyber attacks, intrusions, or other catastrophic events that could result in their failure or reduced functionality, and ultimately the potential loss of sensitive information or the loss of Idaho Power's ability to fulfill critical business functions and provide reliable electric power to customers.  The loss of data could result in violations of privacy and other laws, financial loss to Idaho Power or to its customers, customer dissatisfaction, and significant litigation exposure, all of which could materially affect Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.Changes in tax laws and regulations, or differing interpretation or enforcement of applicable laws by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdictions, could have a material adverse impact on IDACORP’s or Idaho Power’s financial condition and results of operations.  IDACORP and Idaho Power must make judgments and interpretations about the application of the law when determining the provision for taxes.  Amounts of tax-related assets and liabilities involve judgments and estimates of the timing and probability of recognition of income, deductions, and tax credits, which are subject to challenge by taxing authorities.  In recent years, tax settlements, as well as state regulatory mechanisms with tax-related provisions (such 27Table of contents                                as Idaho Power's October 2014 regulatory settlement stipulation with the IPUC), has significantly impacted IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations.  The outcome of ongoing and future income tax proceedings, or the state public utility commissions' treatment of those tax outcomes, could differ materially from the amounts IDACORP and Idaho Power record prior to conclusion of those proceedings, and the difference could negatively affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s earnings and cash flows.  Further, in some instances the treatment from a ratemaking perspective of any tax benefits could be different than IDACORP or Idaho Power anticipate or request from applicable state regulatory commissions, which could have a negative effect on their financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, Idaho Power uses flow-through accounting as described in Note 1 - ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report, and potential changes in tax laws or interpretations may impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's income taxes and reporting obligations differently than other companies.Changes in accounting standards or rules may impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial results and disclosures.  The Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC may make changes to accounting standards that impact presentation and disclosures of financial condition and results of operations.  Further, new accounting orders issued by the FERC could significantly impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's reported financial condition.  Idaho Power meets conditions under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in its financial statements and to defer certain costs as regulatory assets until those costs are collected in rates, and to defer some items as regulatory liabilities.  If recovery of these amounts ceases to be probable, if Idaho Power determines that it no longer meets the criteria for applying regulatory accounting, or if accounting rules change to no longer provide for regulatory assets and liabilities, Idaho Power could be required to eliminate some or all of those regulatory assets or liabilities.  Any of these circumstances could result in write-offs and have a material effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power’s financial condition and results of operations"
15,IDA,IDACORP INC,2016-02-18,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS IDACORP and Idaho Power operate in a highly regulated industry and business environment that involves significant risks, many of which are beyond the companies' control.  The circumstances and factors set forth below may have a material impact on the business, financial condition, or results of operations of IDACORP and Idaho Power and could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in any forward-looking statements.  These risk factors, as well as other information in this report and in other reports the companies file with the SEC, should be considered carefully when making any investment decisions relating to IDACORP or Idaho Power.   If state public utility commissions or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission authorize customer rates that under-collect or untimely collect through rates the amount Idaho Power needs to cover costs and earn a reasonable rate of return, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.  The prices that the Idaho Public Utilities Commission (IPUC) and Public Utility Commission of Oregon (OPUC) authorize Idaho Power to charge customers for its retail services, and the tariff rate that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) permits Idaho Power to charge for its transmission services, are generally the most significant factors influencing IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s business, results of operations, and financial condition.  Idaho Power's ability to recover its costs and earn a reasonable rate of return can be affected by many factors, including the time lag between when costs are incurred and when those costs are recovered in customers’ rates, and differences between the costs embedded in rates and the amount of actual costs incurred.  Idaho Power is often required to incur costs before the IPUC, OPUC, or FERC approves the recovery of those costs, and the IPUC, OPUC, and FERC may not allow Idaho Power to recover costs on the basis that such costs were not reasonably or prudently incurred or for other reasons.  While rate regulation is premised on the assumption that rates will be established that are fair, just, and reasonable, regulators have considerable discretion in applying this standard.  The ratemaking process typically involves multiple intervening parties, including governmental bodies, consumer advocacy groups, and customers, generally with the common objective of limiting rate increases or even reducing rates.  Denial or probable denial of recovery by regulators may cause Idaho Power to record an impairment of its assets.  In a number of proceedings in recent years, Idaho Power has been denied recovery, or required to defer recovery pending the next general rate case, including denials or deferrals related to compensation expenses.   For additional information relating to Idaho Power's regulatory framework and regulatory matters, see Part I - Item 1 - ""Business - Utility Operations,"" Note 3 - ""Regulatory Matters"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report, and Part II - Item 7 - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Regulatory Matters"" in this report. Idaho Power's cost recovery mechanisms may not function as intended and are subject to change, which may adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  Idaho Power has power cost adjustment mechanisms in its Idaho and Oregon jurisdictions and a fixed cost adjustment mechanism in Idaho that provide for periodic adjustments to the rates charged to its retail customers.  The power cost adjustment mechanisms track Idaho Power’s actual net 19Table of contents                                        power supply costs (primarily fuel and purchased power less off-system sales) and compare these amounts to net power supply costs being recovered in retail rates.  A majority of the difference between these two amounts is deferred for future recovery from, or refund to, customers through rates.  In recent years, the volatility in power supply costs has been significant, in large part due to changes in hydroelectric generation conditions and the cost of purchase of renewable energy under long-term contracts.  While the power cost adjustment mechanisms function to mitigate the potentially adverse impact on net income of power supply cost volatility, the mechanisms do not eliminate the cash flow impact of that volatility.  When power costs rise above the level recovered in current retail rates, Idaho Power incurs the costs but recovery of those costs is deferred to a subsequent collection period, which can adversely affect Idaho Power’s operating cash flow and liquidity until those costs are recovered from customers.  The fixed cost adjustment mechanism is a decoupling mechanism designed to remove Idaho Power's disincentive to invest in energy efficiency activities by allowing Idaho Power to charge residential and small commercial customers when it recovers less than the base level of fixed costs per customer that the IPUC authorized for recovery in the most recent general rate case.  Both the power cost and fixed cost adjustment mechanisms were approved through the regulatory process, and thus they are subject to change at the discretion of applicable state regulators, who could decide to modify or eliminate either mechanism in a manner that adversely impacts IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's business, financial condition, and results of operations may be negatively affected by changes in customer growth or customer usage.  Growth in the number of customers and customers' usage of electricity are affected by a number of factors, such as population growth or decline in Idaho Power's service area, adoption rates of energy efficiency measures, customer-generated power such as from rooftop solar panels, demand side management requirements, and economic conditions.  Many electric utilities have experienced a decline in usage per customer, in part attributable to energy efficiency activities.  While Idaho Power has recently experienced a net growth in usage due to an increase in the number of customers, when adjusted for the impacts of weather the average monthly usage on a per customer basis for Idaho residential customers has declined from 1,059 kWh in 2009 to 1,012 kWh in 2014.  Rate mechanisms, such as the Idaho fixed cost adjustment, are designed to address the financial disincentive associated with promoting energy efficiency activities, but there is no assurance that the mechanism will result in full or timely collection of Idaho Power's fixed costs, which are currently collected in large part through the company's kWh energy rates that are based on historical sales volume.  Any undercollection of fixed costs would adversely impact revenues, earnings, and cash flows.  Weak economic conditions may also reduce the amount of energy Idaho Power’s customers consume, result in a loss of customers (including large-load industrial and commercial customers) or further decrease the customer growth rate, and increase the likelihood and prevalence of late payments and uncollectible accounts.  The formation of municipal utilities or similar entities for distribution systems within Idaho Power's service area could also result in a load decrease.  The loss of loads resulting from some of these events may result in IDACORP and Idaho Power modifying or eliminating large generation or transmission projects.  This could in turn result in write-downs or write-offs if regulators determine that the costs of the projects were incurred imprudently, which could have a material adverse impact on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.  Conversely, if Idaho Power were to experience an unanticipated increase in the demand for energy through, for example, the rapid addition of new industrial and commercial customers, Idaho Power may be required to rely on higher-cost purchased power to meet peak system demand and may need to accelerate investment in additional generation or transmission resources.  If the incremental costs associated with the unanticipated changes in loads exceed the incremental revenue received from the sales to the new customers, and Idaho Power is unable to secure timely and full rate relief to recover those increased costs, the resulting imbalance could have an adverse effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.  IDACORP's and Idaho Power's operating results fluctuate seasonally and can be adversely affected by changes in weather conditions and severe weather.  Idaho Power's electric power sales are seasonal, with demand in Idaho Power's service area peaking during the hot summer months, with a secondary peak during the cold winter months.  Electric power demands by irrigation customers in Idaho Power's service area, which are impacted by temperatures and the timing and amount of precipitation, among other factors, can also create significant seasonal changes in usage.  Seasonality of revenues may be further impacted by Idaho Power's tiered rate structure, under which rates charged to customers are often higher during higher-load periods.  Market prices for power also often increase significantly during these peak periods, at times when Idaho Power is required to purchase power in the wholesale markets to meet customer demand.  By contrast, when temperatures are relatively mild or where precipitation supplants irrigation systems, loads are often lower as customers are not using electricity for heating and air conditioning or irrigation purposes.  Thus, weather conditions and the timing and extent of precipitation can cause IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition to fluctuate seasonally, quarterly, and from year to year. 20Table of contents                                        Extreme weather events and their associated impacts (such as fires, high winds, and snow loading) can damage generation facilities and disrupt transmission and distribution systems, causing service interruptions and extended outages through downed transmission and distribution lines, increasing supply chain costs and limiting Idaho Power's ability to meet customer energy demand.  Sustained drought conditions are likely to decrease power generation from hydroelectric plants.  The effect of the failure of Idaho Power's facilities to operate as planned under extreme weather conditions is particularly burdensome during peak demand periods, such as hot summer days.  Damage and disruption in generation, transmission, and distribution systems due to weather-related factors also increases operations and maintenance expenses.  Costs incurred as a result of such events might not be recovered through customer rates if the costs incurred are greater than those allowed for recovery by regulators, and the costs of repair and replacing infrastructure or liability for personal injury or property damage may not be covered in full by insurance. New advances in power generation, energy efficiency, or other technologies that impact the power utility industry could decrease revenues. The increasing cost of energy in the electric utility industry has encouraged the development of new technologies for power generation, power storage, and energy efficiency.  In particular, in recent years the cost of solar generation has decreased significantly, and there are federal tax incentives in place to help further reduce the cost of solar generation.  There is potential that customer-owned power generation systems, particularly if coupled with power storage devices, could become sufficiently cost-effective and efficient that an increasing number of Idaho Power's customers choose to install such systems on their homes or businesses.  Additionally, considerable emphasis has been placed on energy efficiency, such as LED lighting and high-efficiency appliances.  Energy efficiency programs, including programs sponsored by Idaho Power under a directive from state regulatory commissions, are designed to reduce energy demand.  If Idaho Power is unable to adjust its rate design or maintain adequate regulatory mechanisms allowing for timely cost recovery, declining usage from customer-owned generation sources and energy efficiency would result in under-recovery of Idaho Power's costs and reduce revenues, which would impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Capital expenditures for infrastructure, risks associated with construction of that infrastructure, and the timing and availability of cost recovery for the expenditures, can significantly affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  Idaho Power’s business is capital intensive and requires significant investments in energy generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure.  A significant portion of Idaho Power’s facilities were constructed many years ago, and thus require periodic upgrades and frequent maintenance.  Also, long-term anticipated increases in both the number of customers and the demand for energy require expansion and reinforcement of that infrastructure.  For instance, Idaho Power is in the permitting process for two 500-kV transmission line projects, which are intended to help meet future customer energy demands.  Construction projects are subject to usual permitting and construction risks that can adversely affect project costs and the completion time.  These risks include, as examples:•the ability to timely obtain labor or materials at reasonable costs, and defaults by contractors; •equipment, engineering, and design failures; •the effects of adverse weather conditions; •availability of financing; •the ability to obtain and comply with permits and land use rights, and environmental constraints; •delays and costs associated with disputes and litigation with third parties; and •changes in applicable laws or regulations.  If Idaho Power is unable to complete the construction of a project, or incurs costs that regulators do not deem prudent, it may be unable to recover its costs in full through rates or on a timely basis.  Further, if Idaho Power is unable to secure permits or joint funding commitments to develop transmission infrastructure necessary to serve loads, it may terminate those projects and, as an alternative, seek to develop additional generation facilities within areas where Idaho Power has available transmission capacity or pursue other more costly options to serve loads.  To limit the timing-related risks of these projects, Idaho Power may enter into purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals or permits.  If any of the projects are canceled for any reason, including Idaho Power's failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals or permits or because the project is no longer economical, Idaho Power could incur significant cancellation penalties under purchase orders or construction contracts.  Additionally, termination of a project carries with it the potential for impairment of the associated asset if regulators deny full recovery of project costs.  Thus, termination of a project could negatively affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.IDACORP's and Idaho Power’s businesses are subject to an extensive set of environmental laws, rules, and regulations, which could impact their operations and increase costs of operations, potentially rendering some generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate, and could increase the costs and alter the timing of major projects.  A number of federal, state, and local environmental statutes, rules, and regulations relating to air and water quality, natural resources, 21Table of contents                                        renewable energy certificates, and health and safety are applicable to IDACORP's and Idaho Power's operations.  Many of these laws and regulations are described in Part II - Item 7 - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Matters"" in this report.  These laws and regulations generally require IDACORP and Idaho Power to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, and other approvals, including through substantial investment in pollution controls, and may be enforced by both public officials and private individuals.  Some of these regulations are pending, changing, or subject to interpretation, and failure to comply may result in penalties, mandatory operational changes, and other adverse consequences, including costs associated with defending against claims by governmental authorities or private parties and complying with new operating requirements.  Idaho Power devotes significant resources to environmental monitoring, pollution control equipment, and mitigation projects to comply with existing and anticipated environmental regulatory requirements.  However, the current trend is toward more stringent standards, stricter regulation, and more expansive application of environmental regulations.  Environmental regulations have created the need for Idaho Power to install new pollution control equipment at, and may cause Idaho Power to perform environmental remediation on, its owned and co-owned power generation facilities, often at a substantial cost.  For instance, Idaho Power is installing environmental control apparatus in two units of its co-owned Jim Bridger power plant at an estimated cost of $105 million, and may install a second set of control apparatus at two other units at that plant in or around 2021 and 2022.  IDACORP and Idaho Power will incur other costs associated with existing environmental regulations, and the companies expect to incur additional costs associated with pending and future environmental regulations, and those costs are likely to be substantial.  In some cases, the costs to obtain permits and ensure facilities are in compliance may be prohibitively expensive.  If the costs of compliance with those new regulations renders the generating facilities uneconomical to maintain or operate, Idaho Power would need to identify alternative resources for power, potentially in the form of new generation and transmission facilities, market power purchases, demand-side management programs, or a combination of these and other methods.  Furthermore, Idaho Power may not be able to obtain or maintain all environmental regulatory approvals necessary for operation of its existing infrastructure or construction of new infrastructure.  Idaho Power is not guaranteed timely or full recovery through customer rates of costs associated with environmental regulations, environmental compliance, and clean-up of contamination, and regulators may not grant prior approval of cost recovery.  For example, in 2013 the IPUC declined to approve Idaho Power's application requesting a binding commitment to provide rate base treatment for Idaho Power's estimated share of the capital investment in environmental control upgrades at the Jim Bridger power plant, instead reserving the prudence determination (and thus ratemaking treatment) for subsequent proceedings.  If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if Idaho Power fails to obtain, maintain, or comply with any such approval, construction and/or operation of Idaho Power's generation or transmission facilities could be delayed, halted, or subjected to additional costs. Factors contributing to lower hydroelectric generation can increase costs and negatively impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  Idaho Power derives a significant portion of its power supply from its hydroelectric facilities.  During 2015, 47 percent of Idaho Power's electric power generation was from hydroelectric facilities.  Because of Idaho Power’s heavy reliance on hydroelectric generation, factors such as precipitation and snow pack, the timing of run-off, and the availability of water in the Snake River basin can significantly affect its operations.  The combination of a long-term trend of declining Snake River base flows, over-appropriation of water, and periods of drought have led to water rights disputes and proceedings among surface water and ground water irrigators and the State of Idaho.  Recharging the Eastern Snake Plain aquifer by diverting surface water to porous locations and permitting it to sink into the aquifer is one approach to the over-appropriation dispute.  Diversions from the Snake River for aquifer recharge or the loss of water rights reduce Snake River flows available for hydroelectric generation.  When hydroelectric generation is reduced, Idaho Power must increase its use of more expensive thermal generating resources and market power purchases; therefore, costs increase and opportunities for off-system sales are reduced, reducing revenues and potentially earnings.  Through its power cost adjustment mechanisms, Idaho Power expects to recover most (but not all) of the increase in net power supply costs caused by lower hydroelectric generation.  The timing of recovery of the increased costs, however, may not occur until the subsequent power cost adjustment year, adversely affecting cash flows and liquidity.Obligations imposed in connection with hydroelectric license renewals may require large capital expenditures, increase operating costs, reduce hydroelectric generation, and negatively affect IDACORP's or Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition.  For the last several years, Idaho Power has been engaged in an effort to renew its federal license for its largest hydroelectric generation source, the Hells Canyon Complex.  Relicensing includes an extensive public review process that involves numerous natural resource issues and environmental conditions.  The existence of endangered and threatened species in the watershed may result in major operational changes to the region’s hydroelectric projects, which may be reflected in hydroelectric licenses, including for the Hells Canyon Complex.  In addition, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to hydroelectric facilities, which could further increase required 22Table of contents                                        expenditures for marine life recovery and endangered species protection and reduce the amount of hydroelectric generation available to meet Idaho Power’s generation requirements.  One particularly significant issue identified in connection with the Hells Canyon Complex relicensing effort involves water temperature gradients in the Snake River below the Hells Canyon dam.  Certain parties in the relicensing proceedings have advocated for the installation of a water temperature management apparatus which, if required to be installed, would involve substantial costs to construct, operate, and maintain.  Idaho Power may be unable to recover in full or in a timely manner the costs of such an apparatus through rates, particularly given the magnitude of any potential impact on customer rates.  Idaho Power also cannot predict the requirements that might be imposed during the relicensing process, the financial impact of those requirements, whether a new multi-year license will ultimately be issued, and whether the IPUC or OPUC will allow recovery through rates of the substantial costs incurred in connection with the licensing process and subsequent compliance.  Imposition of onerous conditions in the relicensing process could result in Idaho Power incurring significant capital expenditures, increase operating costs (including power purchase costs), and reduce hydroelectric generation, which could negatively affect results of operations and financial condition.Idaho Power’s use of coal and natural gas to fuel power generation facilities exposes it to commodity availability and price risk, which can adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition.  As part of its normal business operations, Idaho Power purchases coal and natural gas in the open market or under short-term or long-term contracts, often with variable pricing terms.  Market prices for coal and natural gas are influenced by factors impacting supply and demand such as weather conditions, fuel transportation availability, economic conditions, and changes in technology.  Natural gas transportation to Idaho Power's three natural gas plants is limited to one primary pipeline, presenting a heightened possibility of supply constraint and disruptions separate from the risk of counterparty default.  Most of Idaho Power's coal supply arrangements are under long-term contracts for coal originating in Wyoming, and thus Idaho Power is exposed to risk of disruption of coal production in, or transportation from, that region.  Idaho Power may from time to time enter into new, or renegotiate, these long-term contracts but can provide no assurance that such contracts will be negotiated or renegotiated on satisfactory terms, or at all.  There also can be no assurance that counterparties to the natural gas or coal supply agreements will fulfill their obligations to supply natural gas or coal, and they may experience financial or technical problems that inhibit their ability to deliver natural gas or coal.  Defaults by coal and natural gas suppliers may cause Idaho Power to seek alternative, and potentially more costly, sources of fuel or rely on other generation sources or wholesale market power purchases.  Idaho Power may not be able to fully or timely recover these increased costs through rates, which may adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Idaho Power’s generation, transmission, and distribution facilities are subject to numerous operational risks unique to it and its industry.  Operating risks associated with Idaho Power's generation, transmission, and distribution facilities include equipment failures, volatility in fuel and transportation pricing, interruptions in fuel supplies, increased regulatory compliance costs, labor disputes, accidents and workforce safety matters, release of hazardous or toxic substances into the air, water, or ground, acts of terrorism or sabotage, the loss of cost-effective disposal options for solid waste such as coal ash, operator error, and the occurrence of catastrophic events at the facilities.  Diminished availability or performance of those facilities could result in reduced customer satisfaction, reputational harm, and regulatory inquiries and fines.  Operation of Idaho Power's owned and co-owned generating stations below expected capacity levels, or unplanned outages at these stations, could cause reduced energy output and lower efficiency levels and result in lost revenues and increased expenses for alternative fuels or wholesale market power purchases.  Accidents, electrical contacts, fires, explosions, catastrophic failures, general system damage or dysfunction, and other unplanned events related to Idaho Power's infrastructure would increase repair costs and may expose Idaho Power to claims for personal injury and property damage.  Further, the transmission system in Idaho Power's service territory is constrained, limiting the ability to transmit electric energy within the service territory and access electric energy from outside the service territory during high-load periods.  Idaho Power's transmission facilities are also interconnected with those of third parties, and thus operation of Idaho Power's and third parties' facilities could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events.  These transmission constraints and events could result in failure to provide reliable service to customers and the inability to deliver energy from generating facilities to the power grid, or not being able to access lower cost sources of electric energy, which could have a negative effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  Volatility in the financial markets, failure of IDACORP or Idaho Power to satisfy conditions necessary for obtaining loans or issuing debt securities, and denial of regulatory authority to issue debt or equity securities may negatively affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s ability to access capital and/or increase their cost of borrowing.  IDACORP and Idaho Power use credit facilities, commercial paper markets, and long-term debt as significant sources of liquidity and funding for operating and capital requirements and debt maturities not satisfied by operating cash flow.  The credit facilities represent commitments by the participating banks to make loans and issue letters of credit.  However, the obligation of the participating banks to make those loans and issue letters of credit is subject to specified conditions.  Idaho Power's ability to issue long-term debt is also subject to a number of conditions included in an indenture, and Idaho Power's ability to issue long-term debt and 23Table of contents                                        commercial paper is subject to the availability of purchasers willing to purchase the securities under reasonable terms or at all.  Because of these limitations, IDACORP and Idaho Power may be unable to issue commercial paper or short-term or long-term debt at reasonable interest rates and terms or at all.  Also, while the credit facilities represent a contractual obligation to make loans, one or more of the participating banks may default on their obligations to make loans under, or may withdraw from, the credit facilities. Idaho Power is required to obtain regulatory approval in Idaho, Oregon, and Wyoming in order to borrow money or to issue securities and is therefore dependent on the public utility commissions of those states to issue favorable orders in a timely manner to permit them to finance their operations, capital expenditures, and debt maturities.  Without additional state regulatory approval, as of the date of this report the aggregate amount of short-term borrowings by Idaho Power at any one time outstanding may not exceed $450 million.  Also, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's credit facilities include financial covenants that limit the amount of debt that can be outstanding as a percentage of total capital, and Idaho Power's long-term debt has also been issued under an indenture that contains a number of financial covenants.  Failure to maintain these covenants could preclude IDACORP and Idaho Power from issuing commercial paper, borrowing under their credit facilities, or issuing long-term debt, and could trigger a default and repayment obligation under debt instruments, which could adversely impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.   A downgrade in IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s credit ratings could affect the companies’ ability to access capital, increase their cost of borrowing, and require the companies to post collateral with transaction counterparties.  Credit rating agencies periodically review the corporate credit ratings and long-term ratings of IDACORP and Idaho Power.  These ratings are premised on financial ratios and performance, the regulatory environment and rate mechanisms, the effectiveness of management, resource risks and power supply costs, and other factors.  IDACORP and Idaho Power also have borrowing arrangements that rely on the ability of the banks to fund loans or support commercial paper, a principal source of short-term financing.  Downgrades of IDACORP’s or Idaho Power’s credit ratings, or those affecting relationship banks, could limit the companies’ ability to access short- and long-term capital under reasonable terms or at all, require the companies to pay a higher interest rate on their debt, and require the companies to post additional performance assurance collateral with transaction counterparties.Idaho Power’s risk management policy and programs relating to economically hedging commodity exposures and credit risk may not always perform as intended, and as a result IDACORP and Idaho Power may suffer economic losses.  Idaho Power enters into transactions to hedge its positions in coal, natural gas, power, and other commodities, and enters into financial hedge transactions to mitigate in part exposure to variable commodity prices.  IDACORP and Idaho Power could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market value of these contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform.  The derivative instruments used for hedging might not offset the underlying exposure being mitigated as intended, due to pricing inefficiencies or other terms of the derivative instruments, and any such failure to mitigate exposure could result in financial losses.  Certain of Idaho Power's hedging and derivative agreements may result in the receipt of, or posting of, collateral with counterparties.  Fluctuations in commodity prices that lead to the posting of collateral with counterparties negatively impact liquidity, and downgrades in Idaho Power's credit ratings may lead to additional collateral posting requirements.  Further, forecasts of future fuel needs and loads and available resources to meet those loads are inherently uncertain and may cause Idaho Power to over- or under-hedge actual resource needs, exposing the company to market risk on the over- or under-hedged position.  To the extent that commodity markets are illiquid, Idaho Power may not be able to execute its risk management strategies, which could result in undesired over-exposure to unhedged positions.  As a result, risk management actions, or the failure or inability to manage commodity price and counterparty risk, may adversely affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s financial condition and results of operations.  Idaho Power could be subject to penalties and operational changes if it violates mandatory reliability and security requirements, which could adversely impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition.  As an owner and operator of a bulk power transmission system, Idaho Power is subject to mandatory reliability standards issued by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and enforced by the FERC.  The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles.  Compliance with reliability standards subjects Idaho Power to higher operating costs and increased capital expenditures.  Idaho Power has received in recent years notices of violations from, and regularly self-reports reliability standard compliance issues to, the FERC, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and the Western Electricity Coordinating Council.  Potential monetary and non-monetary penalties for a violation of FERC regulations may be substantial, and in some circumstances monetary penalties may be as high as $1 million per day per violation.  The imposition of penalties on Idaho Power for its actual or alleged failure to comply with reliability and security requirements could have a negative effect on its and IDACORP’s results of operations and financial condition.    24Table of contents                                        Federally mandated purchases of power from renewable energy projects, and integration of power generated from those projects into Idaho Power's system, may increase costs and decrease system reliability, and adversely affect Idaho Power's and IDACORP's results of operations and financial condition.  An abundance of intermittent, non-dispatchable generation from renewable energy projects interconnected with Idaho Power's system has had an impact on the operation of Idaho Power's generation plants, system reliability, power supply costs, and the wholesale power markets in the Pacific Northwest.  Idaho Power is generally obligated under federal law to purchase power from certain renewable energy projects, regardless of the then-current load demand, availability of lower cost generation resources, or wholesale energy market prices.  This increases the likelihood and frequency that Idaho Power will be required to reduce output from its lower-cost hydroelectric and fossil fuel-fired generation resources, which in turn increases power purchase costs and customer rates.  Further, balancing load and generation from Idaho Power's power generation portfolio is challenging, and Idaho Power expects that its operational costs will continue to increase as a result of its efforts to integrate intermittent, non-dispatchable generation from a large number of renewable energy projects.  If Idaho Power is unable to timely recover those costs through its power cost adjustment mechanisms or otherwise, those increased costs may negatively affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The performance of pension and postretirement benefit plan investments and other factors impacting plan costs and funding obligations could adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations - primarily cash flows and liquidity.  Idaho Power provides a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering most employees, as well as a defined benefit postretirement benefit plan (consisting of health care and death benefits) that covers eligible retirees.  Costs of providing these benefits are based in part on the value of the plans' assets and, therefore, adverse investment performance for these assets could increase Idaho Power’s plan costs and funding requirements related to the plans.  The key actuarial assumptions that affect funding obligations are the expected long-term return on plan assets and the discount rate used in determining future benefit obligations.  Idaho Power evaluates the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis, taking into account changes in market conditions, trends, and future expectations.  Estimates of future equity and debt market performance, changes in interest rates, and other factors Idaho Power and its actuary firms use to develop the actuarial assumptions are inherently uncertain, and actual results could vary significantly from the estimates.  Changes in demographics, including timing of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase Idaho Power's plan costs and funding requirements.  Future pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments are also subject to the impacts of changes in legislation.  Depending on the timing of contributions to the plans and Idaho Power's ability to recover costs through rates, cash contributions to the plans could reduce the cash available for the companies' businesses and payment of dividends.  For additional information regarding Idaho Power's funding obligations under its benefit plans, see Note 11 - ""Benefit Plans"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.   As a holding company, IDACORP does not have its own operating income and must rely on the cash flows from its subsidiaries to pay dividends and make debt payments.  IDACORP is a holding company with no significant operations of its own, and its primary assets are shares or other ownership interests of its subsidiaries, primarily Idaho Power.  IDACORP’s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts to IDACORP, whether through dividends, loans, or other means.  The ability of IDACORP’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to IDACORP depends on several factors, including each subsidiary's actual and projected earnings and cash flow, capital requirements and general financial condition, regulatory restrictions, covenants contained in credit facilities to which they are parties, and the prior rights of holders of their existing and future first mortgage bonds and other debt or equity securities.  Further, the amount and payment of dividends is at the discretion of the board of directors, which may reduce or cease payment of dividends at any time.  See Note 6 - ""Common Stock"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a further description of restrictions on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's payment of dividends. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's activities are concentrated in one industry and in one region, which exposes it to risks from lack of diversification, regional economic conditions, and regional legislation and regulation.  IDACORP and Idaho Power do not have diversified operations or sources of revenue.  Idaho Power comprises the bulk of IDACORP's operations, and Idaho Power's business is concentrated solely in the electricity industry.  Furthermore, Idaho Power's provision of electric service to retail customers is conducted exclusively in its southern Idaho and eastern Oregon service area.  As a result, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's future performance will be affected by economic conditions, regulatory and legislative activity, and other events in its service area and in the electric power industry.  25Table of contents                                        The impacts of a retiring workforce with specialized utility-specific functions could increase costs and adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  Idaho Power’s operations require a skilled workforce to perform specialized utility functions.  Many of these positions, such as linemen, grid operators, and generation plant operators, require extensive, specialized training.  Idaho Power has experienced in recent years an above-average number of employee retirements and expects the increased level of retirement of its skilled workforce and persons in key positions will continue in 2016 and in the near-term.  This will require Idaho Power to attract, train, and retain new employees to help prevent a loss of institutional knowledge and avoid a skills gap.  The loss of skills and institutional knowledge of experienced employees and the costs associated with attracting, training, and retaining appropriately qualified employees to replace an aging and skilled workforce could have a negative effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. IDACORP and Idaho Power are subject to costs and other effects of legal and regulatory proceedings, disputes, and claims.  From time to time in the normal course of business IDACORP and Idaho Power are subject to various lawsuits, regulatory proceedings, disputes, and claims that could result in adverse judgments or settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, or other adverse consequences.  These matters are subject to a number of uncertainties, and as a result management is often unable to predict the outcome of a matter.  Two notable existing legal proceedings are described in Note 10 - ""Contingencies"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.  The legal costs and final resolution of matters in which IDACORP or Idaho Power are involved could have a negative effect on their financial condition and results of operations.  Similarly, the terms of resolution could require the companies to change their operational practices and procedures, which could also have a negative effect on their financial positions and results of operations.Acts or threats of terrorism, cyber attacks, data or physical security breaches, and other acts of individuals or groups seeking to disrupt Idaho Power's operations or the electric power grid could negatively impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  Idaho Power operates in an industry that requires the continuous use and operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure.  Idaho Power's generation and transmission facilities and its grid operations are potential targets for terrorist acts and threats, as well as cyber attacks and other disruptive activities of individuals or groups.  Some of Idaho Power's facilities are deemed ""critical infrastructure,"" in that incapacity or destruction of the facilities could have a debilitating impact on security, reliability or operability of the bulk electric power system, national economic security, and public health and safety.  The possibility that infrastructure facilities, such as generation facilities and electric transmission facilities, would be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror or cyber attack (whether originating internally or externally) may affect Idaho Power's operations by limiting the ability to generate, purchase, or transmit power.  These events, and governmental actions in response, could result in a material decrease in revenues and increase costs to protect, repair, and insure Idaho Power's assets and operate its business.  Federal regulators have stated that a number of organizations continue to seek opportunities to exploit potential vulnerabilities in the U.S. energy infrastructure and that those attacks have become increasingly sophisticated.  Attacks on Idaho Power's infrastructure could result from acts of those organizations or other third parties as well as Idaho Power employees or contractors.  At the same time, Idaho Power's energy infrastructure is becoming more reliant on network-based infrastructure.  Idaho Power's operations require the continuous availability of information technology systems and network infrastructure, and in the normal course of business Idaho Power collects sensitive and confidential customer and employee information and proprietary information of Idaho Power.  Although Idaho Power actively monitors developments in cyber security, no security measures can completely shield Idaho Power's systems, infrastructure, and data from vulnerabilities to cyber attacks, intrusions, or other catastrophic events that could result in their failure or reduced functionality, and ultimately the potential loss of sensitive information or the loss of Idaho Power's ability to fulfill critical business functions and provide reliable electric power to customers.  The loss of data could result in violations of privacy and other laws, financial loss to Idaho Power or to its customers, customer dissatisfaction, and significant litigation exposure, all of which could materially affect Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.Changes in tax laws and regulations, or differing interpretation or enforcement of applicable laws by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdictions, could have a material adverse impact on IDACORP’s or Idaho Power’s financial condition and results of operations.  IDACORP and Idaho Power must make judgments and interpretations about the application of the law when determining the provision for taxes.  Amounts of tax-related assets and liabilities involve judgments and estimates of the timing and probability of recognition of income, deductions, and tax credits, which are subject to challenge by taxing authorities.  In recent years, tax settlements, as well as state regulatory mechanisms with tax-related provisions (such as Idaho Power's October 2014 regulatory settlement stipulation with the IPUC), has significantly impacted IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations.  The outcome of ongoing and future income tax proceedings, or the state public utility commissions' treatment of those tax outcomes, could differ materially from the amounts IDACORP and Idaho Power record prior to conclusion of those proceedings, and the difference could negatively affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s earnings 26Table of contents                                        and cash flows.  Further, in some instances the treatment from a ratemaking perspective of any tax benefits could be different than IDACORP or Idaho Power anticipate or request from applicable state regulatory commissions, which could have a negative effect on their financial condition and results of operations.Changes in accounting standards or rules may impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial results and disclosures.  The Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission may make changes to accounting standards that impact presentation and disclosures of financial condition and results of operations.  Further, new accounting orders issued by the FERC could significantly impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's reported financial condition.  Idaho Power meets conditions under generally accepted accounting principles to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in its financial statements and to defer certain costs as regulatory assets until those costs are collected in rates, and to defer some items as regulatory liabilities.  If recovery of these amounts ceases to be probable, if Idaho Power determines that it no longer meets the criteria for applying regulatory accounting, or if accounting rules change to no longer provide for regulatory assets and liabilities, Idaho Power could be required to eliminate some or all of those regulatory assets or liabilities.  Any of these circumstances could result in write-offs and have a material effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power’s financial condition and results of operations"
7,IDA,IDACORP INC,2015-02-19,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS IDACORP and Idaho Power operate in an industry and business environment that involves significant risks, many of which are beyond the companies' control.  The circumstances and factors set forth below may have a material impact on the business, financial condition, or results of operations of IDACORP and Idaho Power and could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in any forward-looking statements.  These risk factors, as well as other information in this report and in other reports the companies file with the SEC, should be considered carefully when evaluating IDACORP and Idaho Power.   If the Idaho Public Utilities Commission, the Public Utility Commission of Oregon, or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission grant less recovery through rates than Idaho Power needs to cover costs and earn a reasonable rate of return, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.  The prices that the Idaho Public Utilities Commission and Public Utility Commission of Oregon authorize Idaho Power to charge for its retail services, and the tariff rate that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission permits Idaho Power to charge for its transmission services, are generally the most significant factors influencing IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s business, results of operations, and financial condition.  The rates ultimately approved by regulators may not match prior or anticipated future expenses, and recovery of expenses may lag behind the occurrence of those expenses.  The ratemaking process typically involves multiple intervening parties, including governmental bodies, consumer advocacy groups, and customers, generally with the common objective of limiting rate increases or even reducing rates.  Further, while rate regulation is premised on the assumption that rates will be established that are fair, just, and reasonable, regulators have considerable discretion in applying this standard.  The Idaho Public Utilities Commission and the Public Utility Commission of Oregon have the authority to disallow recovery of any costs that they consider unreasonable or imprudently incurred.  Collection of costs and capital expenditures through rates often occurs subsequent to the time those costs and expenditures are incurred, resulting in a lag in collection.  Idaho Power's regulators may also disagree with Idaho Power's rate calculations under various tracking and decoupling mechanisms, like the power cost adjustment and fixed cost adjustment mechanisms.  Regulators may also decide to modify or eliminate these mechanisms, which may make it more difficult for Idaho Power to recover its costs in the rates it charges to customers.  Thus, the regulatory process does not assure that Idaho Power will be able to fully recover its costs or achieve the rate of return authorized or contemplated in connection with the ratemaking process.  In a number of proceedings in recent years, Idaho Power has been denied recovery, or required to defer recovery pending the next general rate case, including denials or deferrals related to compensation expenses and construction expenditures.  In some instances, denial of recovery may cause IDACORP and Idaho Power to record an impairment of those assets.  If Idaho Power's costs are not fully and timely recovered through the rates ultimately approved by regulators, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations, and its ability to earn a return on investment and meet financial obligations, could be adversely affected.  19Table of contentsFor additional information relating to Idaho Power's regulatory framework and recent regulatory matters, see Part I - Item 1 - ""Business - Utility Operations,"" Note 3 - ""Regulatory Matters"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report, and Part II - Item 7 - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Regulatory Matters"" in this report. Idaho Power's cost recovery deferral mechanisms and methods may not function as intended, which may adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  Idaho Power has power cost adjustment mechanisms in its Idaho and Oregon jurisdictions and a fixed cost adjustment mechanism in Idaho that provide for periodic adjustments to the rates charged to its retail customers.  The power cost adjustment mechanisms track Idaho Power’s actual net power supply costs (primarily fuel and purchased power less off-system sales) and compare these amounts to net power supply costs being recovered in retail rates.  A majority, but not all, of the variance between these two amounts is deferred for future recovery from, or refund to, customers through rates.  Consequently, the power cost adjustment mechanisms only partially offset the potentially adverse financial impacts of forced generating plant outages, severe weather, reduced hydroelectric generation, and volatile wholesale energy prices.  When costs rise above the level recovered in current retail rates, it adversely affects Idaho Power’s operating cash flow and liquidity until those costs are recovered from customers.  Further, during 2014 the Idaho Public Utilities Commission opened dockets to review the operation of the Idaho power cost adjustment mechanism and the fixed cost adjustment mechanism.  Any future modification or elimination of the mechanisms based on these or subsequent proceedings may increase Idaho Power's financial exposure to changes in power costs and collection of fixed costs. IDACORP's and Idaho Power's business, financial condition, and results of operations may be negatively affected by changes in customer growth or customer usage.  Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside of the control of IDACORP and Idaho Power, such as implementation of energy efficiency measures, customer-generated power such as from rooftop solar panels, demand side management requirements, and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation or migration, and the overall level of economic activity.  The regional economy in which Idaho Power operates is influenced by conditions in the agriculture, recreation, technology, medical, and other industries, and as these conditions change, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's revenues will be impacted.  Weak economic conditions may reduce the amount of energy Idaho Power’s customers consume, result in a loss of customers (including large-load industrial and commercial customers) or further decrease the customer growth rate, and increase the likelihood and prevalence of late payments and uncollectible accounts.  The adoption of technology by customers can also have both positive and negative impacts on sales.  Some new technologies and modern equipment utilize less energy than in the past, while new electric technologies like electric vehicles can create additional demand.  In light of the need to predict future electric power demands and how Idaho Power can meet those demands, Idaho Power prepares and periodically updates a load forecast as part of its integrated resource planning process.  In doing so, Idaho Power makes load estimates that are based on a number of factors that are uncertain and difficult to estimate, including those described above.  Any unanticipated increase in the demand for energy could result in increased reliance on higher-cost purchased power to meet peak system demand, the need to initiate new demand response and energy efficiency programs, or the need to accelerate investment in additional generation or transmission resources.  If the incremental costs associated with the unanticipated changes in loads exceed the incremental revenue received from those sales, and Idaho Power is unable to secure timely and full rate relief to recover those costs, the resulting imbalance could have an adverse effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  Decreases in loads also have the potential to adversely affect IDACORP and Idaho Power.  A resulting decrease in overall customer usage or collections and slower or negative load growth may delay or decrease capital spending, which can adversely affect Idaho Power's rate base used for establishing customer rates and may reduce revenues, earnings, and cash flows.  Depending on changes in load and infrastructure project timing, Idaho Power may seek to accelerate, scale back, modify, or eliminate projects, or seek alternative projects, to accommodate anticipated resource needs and to help ensure its ability to provide reliable electric service and meet load and transmission capacity obligations.  Scaling back or eliminating a project due to regulatory challenges or other factors influencing the feasibility of a project may result in Idaho Power pursuing one or more separate, more costly projects.  For instance, if Idaho Power were unable to secure permits or joint funding commitments to develop its 500-kV transmission projects, it may terminate those projects and seek other resources to serve loads.  Termination of a project carries with it the potential for a write-off of all or a portion of the costs associated with the project if regulators deem the costs incurred imprudent. Extreme weather events and their associated impacts can adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition.  Extreme weather events and their associated impacts (such as fires and high winds) can 20Table of contentsdamage generation facilities and disrupt transmission and distribution systems, causing service interruptions and extended outages, increasing supply chain costs, and limiting Idaho Power's ability to meet customer energy demand.  The effect of the failure of Idaho Power's facilities to operate as planned under extreme weather conditions is particularly burdensome during peak demand periods, such as hot summer days.  Disruption in generation, transmission, and distribution systems due to weather-related factors also increases operations and maintenance expenses and could negatively affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition.  Economic losses incurred as a result of such events might not be recoverable through customer rates or covered in full by insurance. New advances in power generation, energy efficiency, or other technologies that impact the power utility industry could decrease revenues.  Idaho Power primarily generates power at large central facilities, which results in economies of scale and lower costs than many newer generation technologies.  However, the increasing costs of energy have incentivized the development of new technologies for power generation, power storage, and energy efficiency, and further investment in research and development to make those technologies more efficient and cost-effective.  For instance, while solar technology remains a relatively high-cost means of power generation, in recent years there have been numerous advancements in the design of solar generation facilities and the materials used in panels that may further increase the efficiency and power output of solar generation sources in a more cost-effective manner.  As the cost of the technology has decreased, there has been an increase in adoption of rooftop solar systems by both residential and commercial customers, particularly in areas where electric rates are high and the weather is suitable for solar power systems.  There is potential that these alternative power generation systems, particularly if coupled with power storage devices, could become sufficiently cost-effective and efficient that an increasing number of Idaho Power's customers choose to install such systems on their homes or businesses.  Additionally, considerable emphasis has been placed on energy efficiency, such as LED lighting.  Energy efficiency programs, including programs sponsored by Idaho Power under a directive from state regulatory commissions, are designed to reduce energy demand.  If Idaho Power is unable to maintain adequate regulatory mechanisms or develop new mechanisms or rate structures allowing for timely and adequate cost recovery, declining usage would result in under-recovery of fixed costs.  Further, widespread adoption of distributed generation and declining usage may decrease the need for electric power supplied by Idaho Power, which would reduce Idaho Power's revenue, potentially result in the impairment of assets that produce and deliver energy, and have a negative impact on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition.   Capital expenditures for infrastructure, risks associated with construction of that infrastructure, and the timing and availability of cost recovery for the expenditures, can significantly affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  Idaho Power’s business is capital intensive and requires significant investments in energy generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure.  A significant portion of Idaho Power’s facilities were constructed many years ago, and thus require periodic upgrades and frequent maintenance.  Also, long-term anticipated increases in both the number of customers and the demand for energy require expansion and reinforcement of that infrastructure.  For instance, Idaho Power is in the permitting process for two 500-kV transmission line projects, which are intended to help meet future customer energy demands.  Construction projects are subject to usual permitting and construction risks that can adversely affect project costs and the completion time.  These risks include, as examples:•the ability to timely obtain labor or materials at reasonable costs, and defaults by contractors; •equipment, engineering, and design failures; •the effects of adverse weather conditions; •availability of financing; •the ability to obtain and comply with permits and land use rights, and environmental constraints; •delays and costs associated with disputes and litigation with third parties; and •changes in applicable laws or regulations.  If Idaho Power is unable to complete the construction of a project, or incurs costs that regulators do not deem prudent, it may be unable to recover its costs in full through rates or on a timely basis.  In many instances, review by regulators of the prudence of investments will not occur until expenditures have been made.  Even if Idaho Power completes a construction project, the total costs may be higher than estimated and/or higher than amounts approved for recovery by regulators.  Further, if Idaho Power is unable to secure permits or joint funding commitments to develop transmission infrastructure necessary to serve loads, it may terminate those projects and, as an alternative, seek to develop additional generation facilities within areas where Idaho Power has available transmission capacity or pursue other more costly options to serve loads.  To limit the timing-related risks of these projects, Idaho Power may enter into purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals or siting or environmental permits.  If any of the projects are canceled for any reason, including Idaho Power's failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals or permits or because the project is no longer economical, Idaho Power could incur significant cancellation penalties under the purchase order or construction contracts.  Additionally, termination of a project carries with it the potential for impairment of the associated asset if regulators 21Table of contentsdeny full recovery of project costs.  Thus, termination of a project could negatively affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.IDACORP's and Idaho Power’s businesses are subject to an extensive set of environmental laws, rules, and regulations, which could impact their operations and increase costs of operations, potentially rendering some generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate, and could increase the costs and alter the timing of major projects.  A number of federal, state, and local environmental statutes, rules, and regulations relating to air and water quality, natural resources, and health and safety are applicable to IDACORP's and Idaho Power's operations.  Many of these laws, including the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed rules under Section 111(d) under the Clean Air Act, are described in Part II - Item 7 - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Matters"" in this report.  These laws and regulations generally require IDACORP and Idaho Power to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, and other approvals, including through substantial investment in pollution controls, and may be enforced by both public officials and private individuals.  Some of these regulations are pending, changing, or subject to interpretation, and failure to comply may result in penalties, mandatory operational changes, and other adverse consequences, including costs associated with defending against claims by governmental authorities or private parties and complying with new operating requirements.  Environmental regulations have created the need for Idaho Power to install new pollution control equipment at, and may cause Idaho Power to perform environmental remediation on, its owned and co-owned power generation facilities, often at a substantial cost.  For instance, Idaho Power is in the process of installing environmental control apparatus in two units of its co-owned Jim Bridger power plant at an estimated cost of $113 million, and may install a second set of control apparatus at two other units at that plant in or around 2021 and 2022.  IDACORP and Idaho Power will incur other costs associated with existing environmental regulations, and the companies expect to incur additional costs associated with pending and future environmental regulations, and those costs are likely to be substantial.  If the costs of compliance with those new regulations renders the generating facilities uneconomical to maintain or operate, Idaho Power would need to identify alternative resources for power, potentially in the form of new generation and transmission facilities, market power purchases, demand-side management programs, or a combination of these and other methods.Idaho Power is not guaranteed timely or full recovery of those costs, and regulators may not grant prior approval of cost recovery.  For example, in 2013 the Idaho Public Utilities Commission declined to approve Idaho Power's application requesting a binding commitment to provide rate base treatment for Idaho Power's estimated share of the capital investment in environmental control upgrades at the Jim Bridger power plant, instead reserving the prudence determination (and thus ratemaking treatment) for subsequent proceedings.  Furthermore, Idaho Power may not be able to obtain or maintain all environmental regulatory approvals necessary for operation of its existing infrastructure or construction of new infrastructure.  If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if Idaho Power fails to obtain, maintain, or comply with any such approval, construction and/or operation of Idaho Power's generation or transmission facilities could be delayed, halted, or subjected to additional costs.  At the same time, consumer preference for renewable or low greenhouse gas-emitting sources of energy could impact the desirability of generation from existing sources and require significant investment in new generation and transmission resources.  If Idaho Power is unable to recover in full these increased costs through the ratemaking process, such under-recovery would negatively impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  Relicensing of the Hells Canyon hydroelectric project and construction of the proposed Gateway West and Boardman-to-Hemingway 500-kV transmission lines requires consultation under the Endangered Species Act to determine the effects of these projects on any listed species within the project areas.  The presence of sage grouse, which is being considered for listing as an endangered species, in the vicinity of the Gateway West and Boardman-to-Hemingway transmission projects has required more extensive, costly, and time consuming evaluation and engineering.  These and other requirements of the Endangered Species Act, Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and similar environmental laws may increase costs, adversely affect the timing or ability to complete major projects, and may have an adverse effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition.Factors contributing to lower hydroelectric generation can increase costs and negatively impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  Idaho Power derives a significant portion of its power supply from its hydroelectric facilities.  During 2014, 47 percent of Idaho Power's electric power generation was from hydroelectric facilities.  Because of Idaho Power’s heavy reliance on hydroelectric generation, snow pack, the timing of run-off, drought conditions, and the availability of water in the Snake River basin can significantly affect its operations.  The combination of a long-term trend of declining Snake River base flows, over-appropriation of water, and periods of drought have led to water rights disputes and proceedings among surface water and ground water irrigators and the State of Idaho.  Recharging the Eastern Snake Plain 22Table of contentsaquifer by diverting surface water to porous locations and permitting it to sink into the aquifer is one proposed approach to the over-appropriation dispute.  Diversions from the Snake River for aquifer recharge or the loss of water rights may further reduce Snake River flows available for hydroelectric generation.  When hydroelectric generation is reduced, Idaho Power must increase its use of more expensive thermal generating resources and purchased power; therefore, costs increase and opportunities for off-system sales are reduced, reducing earnings.  Through its power cost adjustment mechanisms, Idaho Power expects to recover most of the increase in net power supply costs caused by lower hydroelectric generation.  Recovery of the increased costs, however, may not occur until the subsequent power cost adjustment year, negatively affecting cash flows and liquidity.Conditions imposed in connection with hydroelectric license renewals may require large capital expenditures, increase operating costs, reduce hydroelectric generation, and negatively affect IDACORP's or Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition.  For the last several years, Idaho Power has been engaged in an effort to renew its federal license for its largest hydroelectric generation source, the Hells Canyon Complex.  Relicensing includes an extensive public review process that involves numerous natural resource issues and environmental conditions.  The existence of endangered and threatened species in the watershed may result in major operational changes to the region’s hydroelectric projects, which may be reflected in hydroelectric licenses.  In addition, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to hydroelectric facilities, which could further increase required expenditures for marine life recovery and endangered species protection and reduce the amount of hydroelectric generation available to meet Idaho Power’s energy requirements.  One particularly significant issue identified in connection with the Hells Canyon Complex relicensing effort involves water temperature gradients in the Snake River below the Hells Canyon dam.  Certain parties in the relicensing proceedings have advocated for the installation of water temperature management apparatus which, if required to be installed, would require substantial capital expenditures to construct and maintain.  Idaho Power may be unable to recover in full the costs of such an apparatus through rates, particularly given the magnitude of any potential impact on customer rates.  Idaho Power also cannot predict the requirements that might be imposed during the relicensing process, the financial impact of those requirements, or whether a new multi-year license will ultimately be issued.  Imposition of onerous conditions in the relicensing process could result in Idaho Power incurring significant capital expenditures, increase operating costs (including power purchase costs), and reduce hydroelectric generation, which could negatively affect results of operations and financial condition.IDACORP's and Idaho Power's operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations, and unusually mild or extreme temperatures and weather can impact their results of operations and financial condition.  Idaho Power's electric power sales are seasonal, with demand in Idaho Power's service area peaking during the hot summer months, with a secondary peak during the cold winter months.  Electric power demands by irrigation customers in Idaho Power's service area, which are impacted by temperatures and the timing and amount of precipitation, among other factors, can also create significant seasonal changes in usage.  Seasonality of revenues may be enhanced by Idaho Power's tiered rate structure, under which rates charged to customers are often higher during higher-load periods.  Market prices for power also often increase significantly during these peak periods, at times when Idaho Power is required to purchase power in the wholesale markets to meet customer demand.  By contrast, when temperatures are relatively mild or where precipitation supplants irrigation systems, loads are often lower as customers are not using electricity for heating and air conditioning or irrigation purposes.  Thus, unusually mild weather or the timing and extent of precipitation can cause IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition to fluctuate seasonally and from year to year.  Complying with renewable portfolio standards could increase capital expenditures and operating costs and adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition.  Renewable portfolio standards require that electricity providers obtain a minimum percentage of their power from renewable energy sources by a specified date.  Idaho Power’s operations in Oregon will be required to comply with a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard beginning in 2025, and it is possible that other states, including Idaho, could adopt renewable portfolio standards.  The cost of purchasing or generating power from renewable energy sources is often greater than fossil fuel and hydroelectric generation sources, and construction of renewable energy facilities involves significant capital expenditures.  As a result, new state or federal renewable portfolio standards could increase capital expenditures and operating costs and negatively affect results of operations and financial condition.  In accordance with a renewable energy certificate management plan on file with the Idaho Public Utilities Commission, Idaho Power currently sells the renewable energy certificates it receives in connection with its power purchases from some renewable energy generation resources, using the proceeds to benefit customers.  Enactment of a renewable portfolio standard in Idaho would cause Idaho Power to retain and retire some or all of those renewable energy certificates rather than sell them for the benefit of customers, and could thus result in increased rates.  Idaho Power’s use of coal and natural gas to fuel power generation facilities exposes it to commodity availability and price risk, which can adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition.  As part of its 23Table of contentsnormal business operations, Idaho Power purchases coal and natural gas in the open market or under short-term or long-term contracts, often with variable-pricing terms.  Market prices for coal and natural gas are influenced by factors impacting supply and demand such as weather conditions, fuel transportation availability, economic conditions, and changes in technology.  Following the completion of the Langley Gulch natural gas-fired power plant, Idaho Power has become more dependent on natural gas for a portion of its electric generating capacity.  Natural gas transportation to Idaho Power's natural gas plants is limited to one primary pipeline, presenting a heightened possibility of supply constraint and disruptions separate from the risk of counterparty default.  Most of Idaho Power's coal supply arrangements are under long-term contracts for coal originating in Wyoming, and thus Idaho Power is exposed to risk of disruption of coal production in, or transportation from, that region.  Idaho Power may from time to time enter into new, or renegotiate, these long-term contracts, but can provide no assurance that such contracts will be negotiated or renegotiated, as the case may be, on satisfactory terms, or at all.  There also can be no assurance that counterparties to the coal supply agreements will fulfill their obligations to supply coal, and they may experience financial or technical problems that inhibit their ability to deliver coal.  The coal supply agreements also contain terms that allow the coal suppliers to curtail the delivery of coal in certain circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster.  Defaults by coal and natural gas suppliers may cause Idaho Power to seek alternative, and potentially more costly, sources of fuel or rely on other generation sources or wholesale market power purchases.  Idaho Power may not be able to fully recover these increased costs through rates or its power cost adjustment mechanisms, which may adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. Historically, natural gas prices have tended to be more volatile than prices for other fuel sources.  Recently, however, the availability of natural gas from shale production has lessened both natural gas prices and price volatility.  Market power prices are impacted in part by the availability and cost of natural gas -- as the price of natural gas falls, other market participants that utilize natural gas-fired generation will be able to generate and sell into the wholesale markets electricity at increasingly competitive prices, which could decrease Idaho Power's off-system sales revenues.   Idaho Power’s generation, transmission, and distribution facilities are subject to numerous operational risks unique to it and its industry.  Operating risks associated with Idaho Power's generation, transmission, and distribution facilities include equipment failures, volatility in fuel and transportation pricing, interruptions in fuel supplies, increased regulatory compliance costs, labor disputes, accidents and workforce safety matters, release of hazardous or toxic substances into the air, water, or ground, acts of terrorism or sabotage, the loss of cost-effective disposal options for solid waste such as coal ash, operator error, and the occurrence of catastrophic events at the facilities.  Diminished availability or performance of those facilities could result in reduced customer satisfaction, reputational harm, and regulatory inquiries and fines.  Operation of Idaho Power's owned and co-owned generating stations below expected capacity levels, or unplanned outages at these stations, could cause reduced energy output and lower efficiency levels and result in lost revenues and increased expenses for alternative fuels or wholesale market power purchases.  Accidents, electrical contacts, fires, explosions, catastrophic failures, general system damage or dysfunction, and other unplanned events related to Idaho Power's infrastructure would increase repair costs and may expose Idaho Power to claims for personal injury or property damage.  Further, the transmission system in Idaho Power's service territory is constrained, limiting the ability to transmit electric energy within the service territory and access electric energy from outside the service territory during high-load periods.  Idaho Power's transmission facilities are also interconnected with those of third parties, and thus operation of Idaho Power's and third parties' facilities could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events.  These transmission constraints and events could result in failure to provide reliable service to customers and the inability to deliver energy from generating facilities to the power grid, or not being able to access lower cost sources of electric energy, which could have a negative effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  As discussed in Item 1 - ""Business"" in this report, in the fourth quarter of 2014 new energy imbalance markets began to emerge in the western United States.  The energy imbalance markets are intended to allow for automated near real-time dispatch of generation resources.  Idaho Power has not yet joined the energy imbalance markets and cannot predict the ultimate impact, whether positive or negative, that the energy imbalance markets will have on its ability to make economic off-system sales and purchase power in the market.  There is potential that, whether Idaho Power joins an energy imbalance market or not, Idaho Power's off-system sales will decrease or purchased power costs will increase, which could adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition. Volatility in the financial markets, or denial of regulatory authority to issue debt or equity securities, may negatively affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s ability to access capital and/or increase their cost of borrowing, or result in losses on investments.  IDACORP and Idaho Power use short-term and long-term debt as a significant source of liquidity and funding for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flow.  In a volatile credit environment IDACORP and Idaho Power may be unable to issue short-term or long-term debt at reasonable interest rates or at all, one or more of the participating banks in IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s credit facilities may default on their obligations to make loans under, or may withdraw from, 24Table of contentsthe credit facilities, or IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s access to capital may otherwise be inhibited.  In addition, at times Idaho Power has a relatively large balance of short-term investments.  Volatility in the financial markets may result in a lack of liquidity for short-term investments and declines in value of some investments.  The occurrence of any of these events could affect Idaho Power's ability to execute its business plan and adversely affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s results of operations and financial condition.  Idaho Power is required to obtain regulatory approval in Idaho, Oregon, and Wyoming in order to borrow money or to issue securities and is therefore dependent on the public utility commissions of those states to issue favorable orders in a timely manner to permit them to finance their operations and capital expenditures.  Notably, without additional approval from those commissions, the aggregate amount of short-term borrowings by Idaho Power at any one time outstanding may not exceed $450 million.  IDACORP's and Idaho Power's credit facilities include financial covenants that limit the amount of debt that can be outstanding as a percentage of total capital.  Idaho Power's long-term debt has also been issued under an indenture that contains a number of financial covenants.  Failure to maintain these covenants could preclude IDACORP and Idaho Power from issuing commercial paper, borrowing under their credit facilities, or issuing long-term debt, and could trigger a default and repayment obligation under debt instruments, which could adversely impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and liquidity.   A downgrade in IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s credit ratings could affect the companies’ ability to access capital, increase their cost of borrowing, and require the companies to post collateral with transaction counterparties.  Access to capital markets is important to IDACORP's and Idaho Power's ability to operate and to complete capital projects.  Credit rating agencies periodically review the corporate credit ratings and long-term ratings of IDACORP and Idaho Power.  These ratings are premised on financial ratios and performance, the regulatory environment and mechanisms, management and their effectiveness, resource risks and power supply costs, and other factors.  These ratings impact access to, and the cost of, borrowing.  IDACORP and Idaho Power also have borrowing arrangements that rely on the ability of the banks to fund loans or support commercial paper, a principal source of short-term financing.  Downgrades of IDACORP’s or Idaho Power’s credit ratings, or those affecting relationship banks, could limit the companies’ ability to access short- and long-term capital under reasonable terms or at all, require the companies to pay a higher interest rate on their debt, and require the companies to post additional performance assurance collateral with transaction counterparties.Idaho Power’s risk management policy and programs relating to economically hedging commodity exposures and credit risk may not always perform as intended, and as a result IDACORP and Idaho Power may suffer economic losses.  Idaho Power enters into transactions to hedge its positions in coal, natural gas, power, and other commodities, and enters into financial hedges to mitigate in part exposure to variable commodity prices.  IDACORP and Idaho Power could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market value of these contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform.  The derivative instruments might not offset the underlying exposure being mitigated as intended, due to pricing inefficiencies or other terms of the derivative instruments, and any such failure to mitigate exposure could result in financial losses.  Further, forecasts of future fuel needs and loads and available resources to meet those loads are inherently uncertain and may cause Idaho Power to over- or under-hedge actual resource needs, exposing the company to market risk on the over- or under-hedged position.  To the extent that commodity markets are illiquid, Idaho Power may not be able to execute its risk management strategies, which could result in undesired over-exposure to unhedged positions.  As a result, risk management actions, or the failure or inability to manage commodity price and counterparty risk, may adversely affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s financial condition and results of operations.  Idaho Power could be subject to penalties and operational changes if it violates mandatory reliability and security requirements, which could adversely impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition.  As an owner and operator of a bulk power transmission system, Idaho Power is subject to mandatory reliability standards issued by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and enforced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles.  Compliance with reliability standards subjects Idaho Power to higher operating costs and increased capital expenditures.  Idaho Power has received in recent years notices of violations from, and regularly self-reports reliability standard compliance issues to, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and the Western Electricity Coordinating Council, as applicable.  Potential monetary and non-monetary penalties for a violation of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulations may be substantial, and in some circumstances monetary penalties may be as high as $1 million per day per violation.  The imposition of penalties on Idaho Power for its actual or alleged failure to comply with reliability and security requirements could have a negative effect on its and IDACORP’s results of operations and financial condition.    25Table of contentsFederally mandated purchases of power from renewable energy projects, and integration of power generated from those projects into Idaho Power's system, may increase costs and decrease system reliability, and adversely affect Idaho Power's and IDACORP's results of operations and financial condition.  An abundance of intermittent, non-dispatchable generation from renewable energy projects interconnected with Idaho Power's system during times when Idaho Power has available lower-cost resources to meet load demands has an impact on the operation of Idaho Power's hydroelectric generation plants, system reliability, power supply costs, and the wholesale power markets in the Pacific Northwest.  Idaho Power's purchases of power from certain renewable energy projects, which Idaho Power is generally obligated to purchase under federal law regardless of the then-current load demand, availability of lower cost generation resources, or wholesale energy market prices, increase the likelihood and frequency that Idaho Power will be required to reduce output from its lower-cost hydroelectric and fossil fuel-fired generation resources, increasing power purchase costs and customer rates.  Further, balancing load and generation from Idaho Power's power generation portfolio is challenging, and Idaho Power expects that its operational costs will continue to increase as a result of its efforts to integrate intermittent, non-dispatchable generation from a large number of renewable energy projects.  Idaho Power anticipates that costs will escalate as the volume of intermittent wind and solar generation on its system increases, which may negatively affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition. The performance of pension and postretirement benefit plan investments and other factors impacting plan costs and funding obligations could adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations - primarily cash flows and liquidity.  Idaho Power provides a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering most employees, as well as a defined benefit postretirement benefit plan (consisting of health care and death benefits) that covers eligible retirees.  Costs of providing these benefits are based in part on the value of the plans' assets and, therefore, adverse investment performance for these assets could increase Idaho Power’s plan costs and funding requirements related to the plans.  The key actuarial assumptions that affect funding obligations are the expected long-term return on plan assets and the discount rate used in determining future benefit obligations.  Idaho Power evaluates the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis, taking into account changes in market conditions, trends, and future expectations.  Estimates of future equity and debt market performance, changes in interest rates, and other factors Idaho Power and its actuary firms use to develop the actuarial assumptions are inherently uncertain, and actual results could vary significantly from the estimates.  Changes in demographics, including timing of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase Idaho Power's plan costs and funding requirements.  Future pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments are also subject to the impacts of changes in legislation.  Depending on the timing of contributions to the plans and Idaho Power's ability to recover costs through rates, cash contributions to the plans could reduce the cash available for the companies' businesses and payment of dividends.  For additional information regarding Idaho Power's funding obligations under its benefit plans, see Note 11 - ""Benefit Plans"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.   As a holding company, IDACORP does not have its own operating income and must rely on the cash flows from its subsidiaries to pay dividends and make debt payments.  IDACORP is a holding company with no significant operations of its own, and its primary assets are shares or other ownership interests of its subsidiaries, primarily Idaho Power.  IDACORP’s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts to IDACORP, whether through dividends, loans, or other payments.  The ability of IDACORP’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to IDACORP depends on several factors, including each subsidiary's actual and projected earnings and cash flow, capital requirements and general financial condition, regulatory restrictions, covenants contained in credit facilities to which they are parties, and the prior rights of holders of their existing and future first mortgage bonds and other debt or equity securities.  Further, the amount and payment of dividends is at the discretion of the board of directors, which may reduce or cease payment of dividends at any time.  See Note 6 - ""Common Stock"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a further description of restrictions on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's payment of dividends.  Employee workforce factors, including the impacts of an aging workforce with specialized utility-specific functions, could increase costs and adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  Idaho Power is subject to workforce factors, including loss or retirement of key personnel, availability of qualified personnel, an aging workforce, and impacts of efforts to organize the workforce.  Idaho Power’s operations require a skilled workforce to perform specialized utility functions.  Many of these positions, such as linemen, grid operators, and generation plant operators, require extensive, specialized training.  Idaho Power expects that a significant portion of its skilled workforce will be retiring within the current decade, which will require Idaho Power to attract, train, and retain new employees to help prevent a loss of institutional knowledge and avoid a skills gap.  Without a skilled workforce, Idaho Power’s ability to provide reliable service to its customers and meet regulatory requirements will be challenging, which could negatively affect earnings.  The costs associated with attracting and retaining appropriately qualified employees to replace an aging and skilled workforce could also have a negative effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. 26Table of contentsIDACORP and Idaho Power are subject to costs and other effects of legal and regulatory proceedings, disputes, and claims.  From time to time in the normal course of business IDACORP and Idaho Power are subject to various lawsuits, regulatory proceedings, disputes, and claims that could result in adverse judgments or settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, or other adverse consequences.  These matters are subject to a number of uncertainties, and as a result management is often unable to predict the outcome of a matter.  As an example, over the past decade Idaho Power has been a party to proceedings relating to high prices for electricity, energy shortages, and blackouts in California and in western wholesale markets during 2000 and 2001, which caused numerous purchasers of electricity in those markets to initiate proceedings seeking refunds or other forms of relief and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to initiate its own investigations.  While Idaho Power has largely disposed of direct claims in those proceedings, the settlements and associated Federal Energy Regulatory Commission orders did not eliminate the potential for speculative ""ripple claims,"" which involve potential claims for refunds from an upstream seller of power based on a finding that its downstream buyer was liable for refunds as a seller of power during the relevant period.  Idaho Power's settlement payments in those proceedings have been relatively small to date, but the legal costs of defending the claims over the past decade have been substantial.  In recent years, Idaho Power has also been a party to legal proceedings advanced by private parties relating to alleged violations of environmental statutes and regulations at its co-owned coal-fired plants.  The legal costs and final resolution of matters in which IDACORP or Idaho Power are involved could have a negative effect on their financial condition and results of operations.  Similarly, the terms of resolution could require the companies to change their business practices and procedures, including the nature and extent of operation of generation facilities, which could also have a negative effect on their financial positions and results of operations.Acts or threats of terrorism, cyber attacks, security breaches, and other acts of individuals or groups seeking to disrupt Idaho Power's operations or the electric power grid could negatively impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  Idaho Power operates in an industry that requires the continuous use and operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure.  Idaho Power's generation and transmission facilities and its grid operations are potential targets for terrorist acts and threats, as well as cyber attacks and other disruptive activities of individuals or groups.  Some of Idaho Power's facilities are deemed ""critical infrastructure,"" in that incapacity or destruction of the facilities could have a debilitating impact on security, reliability or operability of the bulk electric power system, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.  The possibility that infrastructure facilities, such as generation facilities and electric transmission facilities, would be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror or cyber attack (whether originating internally or externally) may affect Idaho Power's operations by limiting the ability to generate, purchase, or transmit power.  These events, and governmental actions in response, could result in a material decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to protect, repair, and insure Idaho Power's assets, and could further adversely affect Idaho Power's operations by contributing to disruption of supplies and markets for natural gas or coal used to fuel gas- or coal-fired power plants.  In the normal course of business, Idaho Power collects, processes, and retains sensitive and confidential customer and employee information and the proprietary information of both Idaho Power and third parties.  Cyber attacks have evolved to become increasingly sophisticated and difficult to detect in recent years.  Despite the cyber security measures in place, Idaho Power's networks and infrastructure could be vulnerable to security breaches, data leakage, or other similar events that could interrupt operations, expose Idaho Power to liability, and require that Idaho Power remedy the security breaches.  Those breaches and events may result from acts of Idaho Power employees, contractors, or third parties.  Separate from liability to third parties and information owners, if Idaho Power's information technology and security systems were to fail or be breached and Idaho Power were unable to recover the systems and/or data in a timely manner, Idaho Power may be unable to fulfill critical business functions. Changes in tax laws and regulations, or differing interpretation or enforcement of applicable laws by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdictions, could have a material adverse impact on IDACORP’s or Idaho Power’s financial condition and results of operations.  IDACORP and Idaho Power must make judgments and interpretations about the application of the law when determining the provision for taxes.  Amounts of tax-related assets and liabilities involve judgments and estimates of the timing and probability of recognition of income, deductions, and tax credits, which are subject to challenge by taxing authorities.  The companies’ tax obligations include income, real estate, public utility, municipal, sales and use, business and occupation, employment-related taxes, and Canadian goods and services and provincial taxes, and ongoing issues related to these taxes.  In recent years, tax settlements, as well as state regulatory mechanisms with tax-related provisions (such as Idaho Power's 2011 regulatory settlement stipulation with the Idaho Public Utilities Commission, which has been extended, with modifications, for future periods), have significantly impacted IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations.  The outcome of ongoing and future income tax proceedings, or the state public utility commissions' treatment of those tax outcomes, could differ materially from the amounts IDACORP and Idaho Power record prior to conclusion of those proceedings, and the difference could negatively affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s earnings and cash flows.  Further, in some instances the treatment from a ratemaking perspective of any tax benefits could be different than IDACORP or Idaho 27Table of contentsPower anticipate or request from applicable state regulatory commissions, which could have a negative effect on their financial condition and results of operations. Changes in accounting standards or rules may impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial results and disclosures.  The Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission may make changes to accounting standards that impact presentation and disclosures of financial condition and results of operations.  Further, new accounting orders issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission could significantly impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's reported financial condition.  Idaho Power meets conditions under generally accepted accounting principles to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in its financial statements and to defer certain costs as regulatory assets until those costs are collected in rates, and to defer some items as regulatory liabilities.  If recovery of these amounts ceases to be probable, if Idaho Power determines that it no longer meets the criteria for applying regulatory accounting, or if accounting rules change to no longer provide for regulatory assets and liabilities, Idaho Power could be required to eliminate some or all of those regulatory assets or liabilities.  Any of these circumstances could result in write-offs and have a material effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power’s financial condition and results of operations"
4,IDA,IDACORP INC,2014-02-20,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS IDACORP and Idaho Power operate in a business environment that involves significant risks, many of which are beyond the companies' control.  The circumstances and factors set forth below may have a material impact on the business, financial condition, or results of operations of IDACORP and Idaho Power and could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in any forward-looking statements.  These risk factors, as well as other information in this report and in other reports the companies file with the SEC, should be considered carefully when evaluating IDACORP and Idaho Power.   If the Idaho Public Utilities Commission, the Public Utility Commission of Oregon, or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission grant less rate recovery in regulatory proceedings than Idaho Power needs to cover existing and future costs and earn an acceptable rate of return, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.  The prices that the Idaho Public Utilities Commission and Public Utility Commission of Oregon authorize Idaho Power to charge for its retail services, and the tariff rate that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission permits Idaho Power to charge for its transmission services, are generally the most significant factors influencing IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s business, results of operations, and financial condition.  The Idaho Public Utilities Commission and the Public Utility Commission of Oregon have the authority to disallow recovery of any costs that they consider unreasonable or imprudently incurred.  Rates are generally established based on a test year, and the rates ultimately approved by regulators may not match expenses at any given time and recovery of expenses may lag behind the occurrence of those expenses.  The ratemaking process typically involves multiple intervening parties, including governmental bodies, consumer advocacy groups, and customers, generally with the common objective of limiting rate increases or even reducing rates.  Further, while rate regulation is premised on the assumption that rates will be established that are fair, just, and reasonable, regulators have considerable discretion in applying this standard.  Thus, the regulatory process does not assure that Idaho Power will be able to fully recover its costs or achieve the rate of return allowed by the Idaho and Oregon public utility commissions and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  In a number of proceedings in recent years, Idaho Power has been denied recovery, or deferred recovery pending the next general rate case, including denials or deferrals related to compensation expenses and construction expenditures.  In some instances, denial of recovery may cause IDACORP and Idaho Power to record an impairment of assets.  If Idaho Power's costs are not fully and timely recovered through the rates ultimately approved 19Table of Contents by regulators, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations, and its ability to earn a return on investment and meet financial obligations, could be adversely affected.  For additional information relating to Idaho Power's regulatory framework and recent regulatory matters, see Part I - Item 1 - ""Business - Utility Operations,"" Note 3 - ""Regulatory Matters"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report, and Part II - Item 7 - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Regulatory Matters"" in this report. Idaho Power's cost recovery deferral mechanisms and methods may not function as intended, which may adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  Idaho Power has power cost adjustment mechanisms in its Idaho and Oregon jurisdictions and a fixed cost adjustment in Idaho that provide for periodic adjustments to the rates charged to its retail customers.  The power cost adjustment mechanisms track Idaho Power’s actual net power supply costs (primarily fuel and purchased power less off-system sales) and compares these amounts to net power supply costs being recovered in retail rates.  A majority, but not all, of the variance between these two amounts is deferred for future recovery from, or refund to, customers through rates.  Consequently, the power cost adjustment mechanisms only partially offset the potentially adverse financial impacts of forced generating plant outages, severe weather, reduced hydroelectric generation, and volatile wholesale energy prices.  When costs rise above the level recovered in current retail rates it adversely affects Idaho Power’s operating cash flow and liquidity until those costs are recovered from customers.  Unanticipated changes in loads in Idaho Power’s service territory expose Idaho Power to market and operational risk and could increase costs and adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition.  To plan for future resource needs, Idaho Power prepares and periodically updates a load forecast as part of its integrated resource planning process.  In doing so, Idaho Power makes load estimates that are based on a number of factors that are uncertain and difficult to estimate, and any unanticipated increase in the demand for energy could result in increased reliance on higher-cost purchased power to meet peak system demand, the need to initiate new demand response and energy efficiency programs, or the need for investment in additional generation resources.  If the incremental costs associated with the unanticipated changes in loads exceed the incremental revenue received from those sales, and Idaho Power is unable to secure timely and full rate relief to recover those costs, the resulting imbalance could have an adverse effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  National and regional economic conditions may reduce customer growth rates, reduce energy consumption, or cause increased late payments and uncollectible customer accounts, which would adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  As noted above, unanticipated increases in loads can cause operational and resource issues.  Similarly, decreases in loads have the potential to adversely affect IDACORP and Idaho Power.  The regional economy in which Idaho Power operates is influenced by conditions in the agriculture, recreation, technology, medical, and other industries, and as these conditions change, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's revenues will be impacted.  The direction and relative strength of the economy has been uncertain in recent years, as evidenced by, for instance, weak real estate markets, difficulties in the financial services sector and credit markets, and high unemployment.  Weak economic conditions may reduce the amount of energy Idaho Power’s customers consume, result in a loss of customers (including large-load industrial and commercial customers) or further decrease the customer growth rate, and increase the likelihood and prevalence of late payments and uncollectible accounts.  A resulting decrease in overall customer usage or collections and load growth may alter capital spending plans and rate base growth and may reduce revenues, earnings, and cash flows, which could adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  Extreme weather events and their associated impacts, such as high winds and fires, can adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition.  Extreme weather events and their associated impacts can damage generation facilities and disrupt transmission and distribution systems, causing service interruptions and extended outages, increasing supply chain costs, and limiting Idaho Power's ability to meet customer energy demand.  The effect of the failure of Idaho Power's facilities to operate as planned under extreme weather conditions would be particularly burdensome during peak demand periods.  Disruption in generation, transmission, and distribution systems due to weather-related factors also increases operations and maintenance expenses and could negatively affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition.  New advances in power generation, energy efficiency, or other technologies that impact the power utility industry could cause an erosion in revenues.  Idaho Power primarily generates power at large central facilities, which results in economies of scale and lower costs than many newer generation technologies.  However, with the increasing costs of energy has come the incentive for the development of new technologies for power generation and energy efficiency, and an investment in research and development to make those technologies more efficient and cost-effective.  For instance, while solar technology remains a 20Table of Contents relatively high-cost means of power generation, there have been numerous recent advancements in the design of solar generation facilities and the materials used in panels that may further increase the efficiency and power output of solar generation sources.  There is potential that power generation systems provided by third parties, whether solar generation or otherwise, could become sufficiently cost-effective and efficient that an increasing number of customers choose to install such systems on their homes or businesses.  Additionally, considerable emphasis has been placed on energy efficiency, such as LED lighting.  Energy efficiency programs, including programs sponsored by Idaho Power, are designed to reduce energy demand.  If Idaho Power is unable to maintain regulatory solutions allowing for recovery, declining usage would result in under-recovery of fixed costs.  Widespread adoption of distributed generation and declining usage may decrease the need for energy supplied by Idaho Power, which would reduce Idaho Power's revenue, potentially result in the impairment of assets that produce and deliver energy, and have a negative impact on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition.   Capital expenditures for power generation, transmission, and delivery infrastructure and replacement of that infrastructure, risks associated with construction of that infrastructure, and the timing and availability of cost recovery for the expenditures, can significantly affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  Idaho Power’s business is capital intensive and requires significant investments in energy generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure.  A significant portion of Idaho Power’s facilities were constructed many years ago, and thus require periodic upgrades and frequent maintenance.  Also, long-term anticipated increases in both the number of customers and the demand for energy require expansion and reinforcement of that infrastructure.  For instance, Idaho Power is in the permitting process for two 500-kV transmission line projects.  Construction projects are subject to usual permitting and construction risks that can adversely affect project costs and the completion time.  These risks include, as examples:•the ability to timely obtain labor or materials at reasonable costs, and defaults by contractors; •equipment, engineering, and design failures; •adverse weather conditions; •availability of financing; •the ability to obtain and comply with permits and land use rights, and environmental constraints; •disputes and litigation with third parties; and •changes in applicable laws or regulations.  If Idaho Power is unable to complete the construction of a project, or incurs costs that regulators do not deem prudent, it may be unable to recover its costs in full through rates or on a timely basis.  In many instances, review by regulators of the prudence of investments will not occur until expenditures have been made.  Even if Idaho Power completes a construction project, the total costs may be higher than estimated and/or higher than amounts approved for recovery by regulators.  If Idaho Power does not receive timely recovery through rates of costs associated with those expansion and reinforcement activities, Idaho Power will have to rely more heavily on external debt or equity financing for its capital expenditures.  These large capital expenditures may weaken the financial profile of IDACORP and Idaho Power.    Further, if Idaho Power were unable to secure permits or joint funding commitments to develop transmission infrastructure necessary to serve loads, such as the Boardman-to-Hemingway transmission line, it may terminate those projects and, as an alternative, seek to develop additional generation facilities within areas where Idaho Power has available transmission capacity or pursue other more costly options to serve loads.  Termination of a project carries with it the potential for a write-off of all or a significant portion of the costs associated with the project if regulators deny recovery of costs they deem imprudently incurred, which could negatively affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.Idaho Power’s business is subject to an extensive set of environmental laws, rules, and regulations, which could impact Idaho Power's operations and increase costs of operations, potentially rendering some generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate, and could increase the costs and alter the timing of major projects.  A number of federal, state, and local environmental statutes, rules, and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, natural resources, and health and safety are applicable to Idaho Power's operations.  Many of these laws and their associated impacts are described in Part II - Item 7 - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Matters"" in this report.  These laws and regulations generally require Idaho Power to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections, and other approvals, and may be enforced by both public officials and private individuals.  Some of these regulations are changing or subject to interpretation, and failure to comply may result in penalties or other adverse consequences, including costs associated with defending against claims by governmental authorities or private parties.  Environmental regulations have created the need for Idaho Power to install new pollution control equipment at, and may cause Idaho Power to perform environmental remediation on, its owned or co-owned facilities, often at a substantial cost.  For instance, Idaho Power plans to install environmental control apparatus at its co-owned Jim Bridger power plant in 2015 and 21Table of Contents 2016 at a cost of approximately $130 million, and a second set of control apparatus in 2021 and 2022.  Idaho Power expects that there will be other costs relating to environmental regulations, and those costs are likely to be substantial.  Idaho Power is not guaranteed recovery of those costs, and regulators may not grant prior approval of cost recovery.  For example, in 2013 Idaho Power filed an application with the Idaho Public Utilities Commission requesting a binding commitment to provide rate base treatment for Idaho Power's $130 million share of the capital investment in environmental control upgrades at a co-owned coal-fired generating plant.  In December 2013, the commission declined to grant binding rate recovery through rates, reserving the prudence determination for subsequent proceedings.  Furthermore, Idaho Power may not be able to obtain or maintain all environmental regulatory approvals necessary for operation of its existing infrastructure or construction of new infrastructure.  If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if Idaho Power fails to obtain, maintain, or comply with any such approval, construction and/or operation of Idaho Power's generation or transmission facilities could be delayed, halted, or subjected to additional costs.  At the same time, consumer preference for renewable or low greenhouse gas-emitting sources of energy could impact the desirability of generation from existing sources and require significant investment in new generation and transmission resources.  If Idaho Power is unable to recover in full these increased costs through the ratemaking process, such non-recovery would negatively impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  Additionally, there are legislative and rulemaking initiatives pending at the federal level and the state level that are aimed at the reduction of fossil fuel plant emissions.  Future changes in environmental laws or regulations governing emissions reduction may result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, require Idaho Power to purchase emission rights and pay new taxes, impair the value of Idaho Power's generating plants, or make some of those plants uneconomical to maintain or operate.Relicensing of the Hells Canyon hydroelectric project and construction of the proposed Gateway West and Boardman-to-Hemingway 500-kV transmission lines requires consultation under the Endangered Species Act to determine the effects of these projects on any listed species within the project areas.  The presence of sage grouse in the vicinity of the Gateway West and Boardman-to-Hemingway transmission projects has required more extensive, costly, and time consuming evaluation and engineering.  These and other requirements of the Endangered Species Act, Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and similar environmental laws may increase costs, adversely affect the timing or ability to complete major projects, and may have an adverse effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition.Factors contributing to lower hydroelectric generation can increase costs and negatively impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  Idaho Power derives a significant portion of its power supply from its hydroelectric facilities.  Because of Idaho Power’s heavy reliance on hydroelectric generation, snowpack, the timing of run-off, drought conditions, and the availability of water in the Snake River basin can significantly affect its operations.  The combination of declining Snake River base flows, over-appropriation of water, and periods of drought have led to water rights disputes and proceedings among surface water and ground water irrigators and the State of Idaho.  Recharging the Eastern Snake Plain aquifer by diverting surface water to porous locations and permitting it to sink into the aquifer is one proposed solution to the over-appropriation dispute.  Diversions from the Snake River for aquifer recharge or the loss of water rights may further reduce Snake River flows available for hydroelectric generation.  When hydroelectric generation is reduced, Idaho Power must increase its use of more expensive thermal generating resources and purchased power; therefore, costs increase and opportunities for off-system sales are reduced, reducing earnings.  Through its power cost adjustment mechanisms, Idaho Power expects to recover most of the increase in net power supply costs caused by lower hydroelectric generation.  Recovery of the increased costs, however, may not occur until the subsequent power cost adjustment year, negatively affecting cash flows and liquidity.Conditions imposed in connection with hydroelectric license renewals may require large capital expenditures, increase operating costs, reduce hydroelectric generation, and negatively affect IDACORP's or Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition.  For the last several years, Idaho Power has been engaged in an effort to renew its federal license for its largest hydroelectric generation source, the Hells Canyon Complex.  Relicensing includes an extensive public review process that involves numerous natural resource issues and environmental conditions.  The listing of various species of marine life, wildlife, and plants as threatened or endangered has resulted in significant changes to federally-authorized activities, including those of hydroelectric projects.  In particular, fish and other marine life recovery plans may require major operational changes to the region’s hydroelectric projects.  In addition, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to hydroelectric facilities, which could further increase required expenditures for marine life recovery and endangered species protection and reduce the amount of hydroelectric generation available to meet Idaho Power’s energy requirements. 22Table of Contents In 2007, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Staff issued a final environmental impact statement for the Hells Canyon Complex, which the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will use in part to determine whether, and under what conditions, to issue a new license for the Hells Canyon Complex.  Certain portions of the final environmental impact statement involve issues that may be influenced by water quality certifications for the project under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act and formal consultations under the Endangered Species Act, which remain unresolved.  One significant issue involves water temperature gradients, and certain parties in the relicensing proceedings have advocated for the installation of water temperature management apparatus which, if required to be installed, would require substantial capital expenditures to construct and maintain.  Idaho Power may be unable to recover in full the costs of such an apparatus through rates, particularly given the magnitude of any potential impact on customer rates.  Idaho Power also cannot predict the requirements that might be imposed during the relicensing process, the financial impact of those requirements, or whether a new multi-year license will ultimately be issued.  Imposition of onerous conditions in the relicensing process could result in Idaho Power incurring significant capital expenditures, increase operating costs (including power purchase costs), and reduce hydroelectric generation, which could negatively affect results of operations and financial condition.IDACORP's and Idaho Power's operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations, and unusually mild or extreme temperatures and weather can impact their results of operations and financial condition.  Idaho Power's electric power sales are seasonal, with demand in Idaho Power's service area peaking during the hot summer months, with a secondary peak during the cold winter months.  The loads required by irrigation customers in Idaho Power's service area can also create significant seasonal changes in usage.  Market prices for power also often increase significantly during these peak periods, at times when Idaho Power is required to purchase power in the wholesale markets to meet customer demand.  By contrast, when temperatures are relatively mild or where precipitation supplants irrigation systems, loads are often lower as customers are not using electricity for heating and air conditioning or irrigation purposes.  Thus, unusually mild weather or the timing and extent of precipitation in the future could adversely impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition.  Complying with state or federal renewable portfolio standards could increase capital expenditures and operating costs and adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition.  A number of states have adopted renewable portfolio standards, which require that electricity providers obtain a minimum percentage of their power from renewable energy sources by a specified date.  Idaho Power’s operations in Oregon will be required to comply with a ten percent renewable portfolio standard beginning in 2025, and it is possible that other states, including Idaho, could adopt renewable portfolio standards.  The cost of purchasing or generating power from renewable energy sources is often greater than fossil fuel and hydroelectric generation sources, and construction of renewable energy facilities involves significant capital expenditures.  As a result, new state or federal renewable portfolio standards could increase capital expenditures and operating costs and negatively affect results of operations and financial condition.Idaho Power’s reliance on coal and natural gas to fuel its non-hydroelectric power generation facilities exposes it to the risk of increased costs and reduced earnings.  As part of its normal business operations, Idaho Power purchases coal and natural gas in the open market or under short-term or long-term contracts, often with variable-pricing terms.  Market prices for coal and natural gas are influenced by factors impacting supply and demand such as weather conditions, fuel transportation availability, economic conditions, and changes in technology.  Most of Idaho Power's coal supply arrangements are under long-term contracts for coal originating in Wyoming.  Any disruption of coal production in, or transportation from, that region may cause Idaho Power to incur additional fuel supply costs or use alternative generation sources or wholesale market power purchases.  Idaho Power may from time to time enter into new, or renegotiate, these long-term contracts, but can provide no assurance that such contracts will be negotiated or renegotiated, as the case may be, on satisfactory terms, or at all.  Natural gas transportation to Idaho Power's natural gas plants is limited to one primary pipeline, presenting a heightened possibility of supply disruptions.  Idaho Power is also exposed to the risk that its counterparties to fuel purchase arrangements will default on their obligations, causing Idaho Power to seek alternative sources of fuel or rely on other generation sources or wholesale market power purchases.  Idaho Power may not be able to fully recover these increased costs through rates or its power cost adjustment mechanisms, which may adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  Idaho Power’s generation, transmission, and distribution facilities are subject to numerous operational risks unique to it and its industry.  Operating risks associated with Idaho Power's generation, transmission, and distribution facilities include equipment failures, volatility in fuel and transportation pricing, interruptions in fuel supplies, increased regulatory compliance costs, labor disputes, accidents and workforce safety matters, release of hazardous or toxic substances into the air, water, or ground, acts of terrorism or sabotage, the loss of cost-effective disposal options for solid waste such as coal ash, operator error, and the occurrence of catastrophic events at the facilities.  Diminished availability or performance of those facilities could result in reduced customer satisfaction, reputational harm, and regulatory inquiries and fines.  Operation of Idaho Power's owned and co-owned generating stations below expected capacity levels, or unplanned outages at these stations, could cause reduced energy output and lower efficiency levels and result in lost revenues and increased expenses for alternative fuels or wholesale 23Table of Contents market power purchases.  Accidents, fires, explosions, system damage or dysfunction, and other unplanned events related to Idaho Power's infrastructure would increase repair costs and may expose Idaho Power to claims for personal injury or property damage.  Further, the transmission system in Idaho Power's service territory is constrained, limiting the ability to transmit electric energy within the service territory and access electric energy from outside the service territory during high-load periods.  Idaho Power's transmission facilities are also interconnected with those of third parties, and thus operation of Idaho Power's and third parties' facilities could be adversely affected by unexpected or uncontrollable events.  These transmission constraints and events could result in failure to provide reliable service to customers and the inability to deliver energy from generating facilities to the power grid, or not being able to access lower cost sources of electric energy, which could have a negative effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  Volatility in the financial markets, or denial of regulatory authority to issue debt or equity securities, may negatively affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s ability to access capital and/or increase their cost of borrowing, or result in losses on investments.  IDACORP and Idaho Power use short-term and long-term debt as a significant source of liquidity and funding for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flow.  Financial markets have in recent years experienced extreme volatility and disruption, at times resulting in a decrease in the availability of liquidity and credit for borrowers.  In a volatile credit environment, Idaho Power may be unable to issue short-term or long-term debt at reasonable interest rates or at all, one or more of the participating banks in IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s credit facilities may default on their obligations to make loans under, or may withdraw from, the credit facilities, or IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s access to capital may otherwise be inhibited.  In addition, at times Idaho Power has a relatively large balance of short-term investments.  Volatility in the financial markets may result in a lack of liquidity for short-term investments and declines in value of some investments.  The occurrence of any of these events could affect Idaho Power's ability to execute its business plan and adversely affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s results of operations and financial condition.  Further, Idaho Power is required to obtain regulatory approval in Idaho, Oregon, and Wyoming in order to borrow money or to issue securities and is therefore dependent on the public utility commissions of those states to issue favorable orders in a timely manner to permit them to finance their operations.  Notably, without additional approval from those commissions, the aggregate amount of short-term borrowings by Idaho Power at any one time outstanding may not exceed $450 million.  Idaho Power maintains its credit facilities primarily to provide back-up for commercial paper programs.  These facilities include financial covenants that limit the amount of debt that can be outstanding as a percentage of total capital.  Idaho Power's long-term debt has also been issued under an indenture that contains a number of financial covenants.  Failure to maintain these covenants could preclude IDACORP and Idaho Power from issuing commercial paper, borrowing under their credit facilities, or issuing long-term debt, and could trigger a default and repayment obligation under debt instruments, which could adversely impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and liquidity.   A downgrade in IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s credit ratings could affect the companies’ ability to access capital, increase their cost of borrowing, and require the companies to post collateral with transaction counterparties.  Access to capital markets is important to IDACORP's and Idaho Power's ability to operate and to complete capital projects, including its planned transmission projects.  Credit rating agencies periodically review the corporate credit ratings and long-term ratings of IDACORP and Idaho Power.  These ratings are premised on financial ratios and performance, the regulatory environment and mechanisms, management and their effectiveness, resource risks and power supply costs, and other factors.  These ratings impact access to, and the cost of, borrowing.  IDACORP and Idaho Power also have borrowing arrangements that rely on the ability of the banks to fund loans or support commercial paper, a principal source of short-term financing.  Downgrades of IDACORP’s or Idaho Power’s credit ratings, or those affecting relationship banks, could limit the companies’ ability to access capital, including commercial paper markets, require the companies to pay a higher interest rate on their debt, and require the companies to post additional performance assurance collateral with transaction counterparties.Idaho Power’s risk management policy and programs relating to economically hedging power and gas exposures, financial and interest rate risk, and counterparty creditworthiness may not always perform as intended, and as a result IDACORP and Idaho Power may suffer economic losses.  Idaho Power enters into transactions to hedge its positions in coal, natural gas, power, and other commodities, and enters into financial hedges to mitigate in part price exposure.  IDACORP and Idaho Power could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market value of these contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform.  The derivative instruments might not offset the underlying exposure being mitigated as intended, due to pricing inefficiencies or other terms of the derivative instruments, and any such failure to mitigate exposure could result in financial losses.  Further, forecasts of future fuel needs and loads and available resources to meet those loads are inherently uncertain and may cause Idaho Power to over- or under-hedge actual resource needs, exposing the company to market risk on the over- or under-hedged position.  To the extent that commodity markets are illiquid, Idaho Power may not be able to execute its risk management strategies, which could result in undesired over-exposure to unhedged positions.  As a result, risk management actions may adversely affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s financial condition and results of operations.  24Table of Contents Idaho Power could be subject to penalties and operational changes if it violates mandatory reliability and security requirements, which could adversely impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition.  As an owner and operator of a bulk power transmission system, Idaho Power is subject to mandatory reliability standards issued by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and enforced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles.  Compliance with reliability standards subjects Idaho Power to higher operating costs and increased capital expenditures.  Further, Idaho Power has received in recent years notices of violations from, and regularly self-reports reliability standard compliance issues to, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and the Western Electricity Coordinating Council, as applicable.  Potential monetary and non-monetary penalties for a violation of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulations may be substantial, and in some circumstances monetary penalties may be as high as $1 million per day per violation.  The imposition of penalties on Idaho Power could have a negative effect on its and IDACORP’s results of operations and financial condition.    Federally mandated purchases of power from PURPA power projects, and integration of power generated from those projects into Idaho Power's system, may increase costs and decrease system reliability, and adversely affect Idaho Power's and IDACORP's results of operations and financial condition.  An abundance of intermittent, non-dispatchable wind power generation at times when Idaho Power has available lower-cost resources to meet load demands has an impact on the operation of Idaho Power's hydroelectric generation plants, system reliability, power supply costs, and the wholesale power markets in the Pacific Northwest.  Wind power generated from PURPA projects, which Idaho Power is generally obligated to purchase regardless of the then-current load demand or wholesale energy market prices, increases the likelihood and frequency that Idaho Power will be required to reduce output from its lower-cost hydroelectric and fossil fuel-fired generation resources, increasing power purchase costs.  Further, balancing load and generation from Idaho Power's power generation portfolio is challenging, and Idaho Power expects that its operational costs will increase as a result of its efforts to integrate intermittent, non-dispatchable power from a large number of PURPA power projects.  Recent efforts to obtain further authorization to curtail certain intermittent power sources during light-load times have been unsuccessful.  Idaho Power anticipates that costs will escalate as the volume of wind and other intermittent power on Idaho Power's system increases, which may negatively affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition. The performance of pension and postretirement benefit plan investments and other factors impacting plan costs and funding obligations could adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations - primarily cash flows and liquidity.  Idaho Power provides a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering most employees, as well as a defined benefit postretirement benefit plan (consisting of health care and death benefits) that covers eligible retirees.  Costs of providing these benefits are based in part on the value of the plans' assets and, therefore, adverse investment performance for these assets could increase Idaho Power’s plan costs and funding requirements related to the plans.  The key actuarial assumptions that affect funding obligations are the expected long-term return on plan assets and the discount rate used in determining future benefit obligations.  Idaho Power evaluates the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis, taking into account changes in market conditions, trends, and future expectations.  Estimates of future equity and debt market performance, changes in interest rates, and other factors Idaho Power and its actuary firms use to develop the actuarial assumptions are inherently uncertain, and actual results could vary significantly from the estimates.  Changes in demographics, including  timing of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase Idaho Power's plan costs and funding requirements.  Future pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments are also subject to the impacts of changes in legislation.  Depending on the timing of contributions to the plans and Idaho Power's ability to recover costs through rates, cash contributions to the plans could reduce the cash available for the companies' businesses and dividends.  For additional information regarding Idaho Power's funding obligations under its benefit plans, see Note 11 - ""Benefit Plans"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.   As a holding company, IDACORP does not have its own operating income and must rely on the cash flows from its subsidiaries to pay dividends and make debt payments.  IDACORP is a holding company with no significant operations of its own, and its primary assets are shares or other ownership interests of its subsidiaries, primarily Idaho Power.  IDACORP’s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts to IDACORP, whether through dividends, loans, or other payments.  The ability of IDACORP’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to IDACORP depends on several factors, including each subsidiary's actual and projected earnings and cash flow, capital requirements and general financial condition, regulatory restrictions, covenants contained in credit facilities to which they are parties, and the prior rights of holders of their existing and future first mortgage bonds and other debt or equity securities.  Further, the amount and payment of dividends is at the discretion of the board of directors, which may reduce or cease payment of dividends at any time.  See Item 5 - ""Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities"" in this report for a further description of restrictions on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's payment of dividends. 25Table of Contents  Employee workforce factors, including the impacts of an aging workforce with specialized utility-specific functions, could increase costs and adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  Idaho Power is subject to workforce factors, including loss or retirement of key personnel, availability of qualified personnel, an aging workforce, and impacts of efforts to organize the workforce.  A unionization attempt that was launched in late-2012 was unsuccessful, but does not prevent future unionization attempts.  Idaho Power’s operations require a skilled workforce to perform specialized utility functions.  Many of these positions, such as linemen, grid operators, and generation plant operators, require extensive, specialized training.  Idaho Power expects that a significant portion of its skilled workforce will be retiring within the current decade, which will require Idaho Power to attract, train, and retain skilled workers to prevent a loss of institutional knowledge and avoid a skills gap.  Without a skilled workforce, Idaho Power’s ability to provide quality service to its customers and meet regulatory requirements will be challenging, which could negatively affect earnings.  The costs associated with attracting and retaining appropriately qualified employees to replace an aging and skilled workforce could have a negative effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. IDACORP and Idaho Power are subject to costs and other effects of legal and regulatory proceedings, disputes, and claims.  From time to time in the normal course of business IDACORP and Idaho Power are subject to various lawsuits, regulatory proceedings, disputes, and claims that could result in adverse judgments or settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, or other relief.  These matters are subject to a number of uncertainties, and as a result management is often unable to predict the outcome of a matter.  As an example, over the past decade Idaho Power has been a party to proceedings relating to high prices for electricity, energy shortages, and blackouts in California and in western wholesale markets during 2000 and 2001, which caused numerous purchasers of electricity in those markets to initiate proceedings seeking refunds or other forms of relief and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to initiate its own investigations.  While Idaho Power has largely disposed of direct claims in those proceedings, the settlements and associated Federal Energy Regulatory Commission orders did not eliminate the potential for speculative ""ripple claims,"" which involve potential claims for refunds from an upstream seller of power based on a finding that its downstream buyer was liable for refunds as a seller of power during the relevant period.  Idaho Power's settlement payments in those proceedings have been relatively small to date, but the legal costs of defending the claims over the past decade have been substantial.  In recent years, Idaho Power has also been a party to legal proceedings advanced by private parties relating to alleged violations of environmental laws at coal-fired plants.  The legal costs and final resolution of matters in which IDACORP or Idaho Power are involved could have a negative effect on their financial condition and results of operations.  Similarly, the terms of resolution could require the companies to change their business practices and procedures, which could also have a negative affect on their financial positions and results of operations.Acts or threats of terrorism, cyber attacks, security breaches, and other acts of individuals or groups seeking to disrupt Idaho Power's operations, or the businesses of third parties, could negatively impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  Idaho Power's generation and transmission facilities are potential targets for terrorist acts and threats, as well as cyber attacks and other disruptive activities of individuals or groups.  Some of Idaho Power's facilities are deemed ""critical infrastructure,"" in that incapacity or destruction of the facilities could have a debilitating impact on security, reliability or operability of the bulk electric power system, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.  The possibility that infrastructure facilities, such as generation facilities and electric transmission facilities, would be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror or cyber attack (whether originating internally or externally) may affect Idaho Power's operations by limiting the ability to generate, purchase, or transmit power and by delaying the development and construction of new generating and transmission facilities and capital improvements to existing facilities.  These events, and governmental actions in response, could result in a material decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to repair and insure Idaho Power's assets, and could further adversely affect Idaho Power's operations by contributing to disruption of supplies and markets for natural gas or coal used to fuel gas- or coal-fired power plants.  In the normal course of business, Idaho Power collects, processes, and retains sensitive and confidential customer and proprietary information, and operates systems that directly impact the availability of electric power and the transmission of electric power in the electric grid.  Despite the security measures in place, Idaho Power's facilities and systems could be vulnerable to security breaches, data leakage, or other similar events that could interrupt operations, exposing Idaho Power to liability.  Those breaches and events may result from acts of Idaho Power employees, contractors, or third parties.  If Idaho Power's information technology and security systems were to fail or be breached and Idaho Power were unable to recover the systems and/or data in a timely manner, Idaho Power may be unable to fulfill critical business functions.  In such case, confidential and proprietary business, employee, or customer information could be compromised, exposing Idaho Power to liability and causing business disruptions, which could negatively affect Idaho Power's business operations and IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.   26Table of Contents Idaho Power's business and operations may be adversely affected by its inability to successfully implement information technology projects.  Idaho Power has undertaken several multi-year company-wide information technology solution upgrades intended to replace existing software and systems, some of which have been completed and some of which are ongoing or in early stages.  These projects include a new customer information system implemented in 2013, Idaho Power's SmartGrid initiative, and the current migration from Idaho Power's existing mainframe system to an open system.  Idaho Power is also implementing systems to augment and improve its ability to pinpoint the sources of electric system outages, respond to them more quickly, and focus repair efforts.  Implementation of these information systems and technology solutions is complex, expensive, and time consuming.  If Idaho Power does not successfully implement the new systems and processes, or if the systems do not operate as intended or cause data or operational errors, it could result in substantial disruptions to Idaho Power's business, which could have a material adverse effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition.Changes in tax laws and regulations, or differing interpretation or enforcement of applicable laws by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdictions, could have a material adverse impact on IDACORP’s or Idaho Power’s financial condition and results of operations.  IDACORP and Idaho Power must make judgments and interpretations about the application of the law when determining the provision for taxes.  The companies’ tax obligations include income, real estate, public utility, municipal, sales and use, business and occupation, and employment-related taxes and ongoing issues related to these taxes.  These judgments may include reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that may be subject to challenge by taxing authorities.  In recent years, tax settlements, as well as state regulatory mechanisms with tax-related provisions (such as Idaho Power's December 2011 settlement with the Idaho Public Utilities Commission), have significantly impacted IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations. The outcome of ongoing and future income tax proceedings, or the state public utility commissions' treatment of those tax outcomes, could differ materially from the amounts IDACORP and Idaho Power record prior to conclusion of those proceedings, and the difference could negatively affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s earnings and cash flows.  Further, in some instances the treatment from a ratemaking perspective of any tax benefits could be different than IDACORP or Idaho Power anticipate or request from applicable state regulatory commissions, which could have a negative effect on their financial condition and results of operations. Changes in accounting standards or Securities and Exchange Commission rules may impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial results and disclosures.  The Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission may make changes to accounting standards that impact presentation and disclosures of financial condition and results of operations.  Further, new accounting orders issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission could significantly impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's reported financial condition.  Idaho Power meets conditions under generally accepted accounting principles to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in its financial statements and to defer certain costs as regulatory assets until those costs are collected in rates, and to defer some items as regulatory liabilities.  Idaho Power expects to recover its regulatory assets from customers through rates but recovery is subject to review by the regulatory bodies.  If recovery of these amounts ceases to be probable, if Idaho Power determines that it no longer meets the criteria for applying regulatory accounting, or if accounting rules change to no longer provide for regulatory assets and liabilities, Idaho Power could be required to eliminate some or all of those regulatory assets or liabilities.  Any of these circumstances could result in write-offs and have a material effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power’s financial condition and results of operations"
13,IDA,IDACORP INC,2013-02-21,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS The circumstances and factors set forth below may have a material impact on the business, financial condition, or results of operations of IDACORP and Idaho Power and could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in any forward-looking statements.     If the Idaho Public Utilities Commission, the Oregon Public Utility Commission, or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission grant less rate recovery in regulatory proceedings than Idaho Power needs to cover existing and future costs and earn an acceptable rate of return, IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.  The prices that the Idaho Public Utilities Commission and Oregon Public Utility Commission authorize Idaho Power to charge for its retail services, and the tariff rate that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission permits Idaho Power to charge for its transmission services, are generally the most significant factors influencing IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s business, results of operations, and financial condition.  The Idaho Public Utilities Commission and Oregon Public Utility Commission have the authority to disallow recovery of any costs that they consider unreasonable or imprudently incurred.  Also, the rates allowed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for transmission service may be insufficient for recovery of costs incurred.  The regulatory process does not assure that Idaho Power will be able to achieve the rate of return allowed by the Idaho and Oregon public utility commissions.  Further, while the Idaho Public Utilities Commission and Oregon Public Utility Commission are required to establish rates that are fair, just, and reasonable, they have considerable discretion in applying this standard.  The ratemaking process typically involves multiple parties, including governmental bodies, consumer advocacy groups, and customers.  While each party has differing concerns, they often have the common objective of limiting rate increases or even reducing rates.  Idaho Power cannot predict the outcome of ratemaking proceedings, including what rates of return will be authorized, the extent to which costs will be allowed for recovery, or the timing of recovery.  The failure of Idaho Power to obtain approvals from regulatory authorities to recover costs, construct new generating or transmission facilities, install environmental emission control equipment, or otherwise operate Idaho Power's business may adversely impact Idaho Power's ability to achieve its strategic plan, cause IDACORP and Idaho Power to record an impairment of their assets, and have a material adverse impact on their results of operations and financial condition.  In a number of proceedings in recent years, Idaho Power has been denied recovery, or deferred recovery pending the next general rate case, including denials or deferrals related to compensation expenses and construction expenditures.  For additional information relating to Idaho Power's regulatory framework and recent matters, see Item 1 - ""Business - Utility Operations,"" Note 3 - ""Regulatory Matters"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report, and Item 7 - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Regulatory Matters"" in this report. Idaho Power's cost recovery deferral mechanisms may not function as intended, which may adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  Idaho Power has power cost adjustment mechanisms in its Idaho and Oregon jurisdictions and a fixed cost adjustment mechanism in Idaho that provide for periodic adjustments to the rates charged to its retail customers.  The power cost adjustment mechanisms track Idaho Power’s actual net power supply costs (primarily fuel and purchased power less off-system sales) and compares these amounts to net power supply costs being recovered in retail rates.  A majority, but not all, of the variance between these two amounts is deferred for future recovery from, or refund to, customers through rates.  Consequently, the power cost adjustment mechanisms only partially offset the potentially adverse financial impacts of forced generating plant outages, severe weather, reduced hydroelectric generation, and volatile wholesale energy prices.  Because of the power cost adjustment mechanisms, the primary financial impact of power 19Table of Contentssupply cost variations is on the timing of cash flows.  When costs rise above the level recovered in current retail rates it adversely affects Idaho Power’s operating cash flow and liquidity until those costs are recovered from customers.  Unanticipated changes in loads in Idaho Power’s service territory expose Idaho Power to market and operational risk and could increase costs and adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition.  While Idaho Power’s customer growth rate has slowed in recent years, Idaho Power believes its service territory is an attractive one for both businesses and individuals.  Idaho Power has recently adjusted its load forecast as part of its integrated resource planning process, predicting a lower growth rate over its 20-year resource planning horizon compared to prior estimates.  In its efforts to balance loads and resources, Idaho Power makes load estimates that are based on a number of factors that are uncertain and difficult to estimate, and any unanticipated increase in the demand for energy could result in increased reliance on purchased power to meet peak system demand, the need to reinstate or initiate new demand response and energy efficiency programs, or the need for investment in additional generation resources.  If the incremental costs associated with the unanticipated changes in loads exceed the incremental revenue and Idaho Power is unable to secure timely rate relief to recover those costs, the resulting disconnect between the time costs are incurred or investments are made and the time costs are recovered could have an adverse effect on IDACORP's or Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  National and regional economic conditions may reduce customer growth rates, reduce energy consumption, or cause increased late payments and uncollectible customer accounts, which would adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  Beginning in 2008, economic conditions in Idaho Power’s service area have been relatively weak.  Weak economic conditions may reduce the amount of energy Idaho Power’s customers consume, result in a loss of customers (including large-load industrial and commercial customers) or further decrease the customer growth rate, and increase the likelihood and prevalence of late payments and uncollectible accounts.  A resulting decrease in overall customer usage or collections and load growth at a rate less than anticipated may alter capital spending plans and rate base growth and may reduce revenues, earnings, and cash flows.  Also, Idaho Power's regulatory mechanisms, including its load change adjustment rate and fixed cost adjustment mechanism in Idaho, are unlikely to result in Idaho Power recovering all of its costs related to load decreases, which would have a negative impact on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.Extreme weather events and their associated impacts, such as high winds and fires, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, can adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition.  Extreme weather events can damage generation facilities and disrupt transmission and distribution systems, causing service interruptions and extended outages, increasing supply chain costs, and limiting Idaho Power's ability to meet customer energy demand.  Disruption in generation, transmission, and distribution systems due to weather-related factors also increases operations and maintenance expenses and could negatively affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operation and financial condition.  New advances in power generation, energy efficiency, or other technologies that impact the power utility industry could cause an erosion in revenues.  With the escalating costs of energy has come the incentive for the development of new technologies for power generation and energy efficiency, and an investment in research and development to make those technologies more efficient and cost-effective.  For instance, while solar technology remains a relatively high-cost means of power generation, there have been numerous recent advancements in the design of solar generation facilities and the materials used in panels (for example, copper indium gallium diselenide and amorphous silicon).  These advancements may further increase the efficiency and power output of solar generation sources.  Considerable emphasis has also been placed on energy efficiency and products that reduce electricity usage, such as LED lighting.  There is potential that power generation systems provided by third parties, whether solar generation or otherwise, and energy efficiency measures could become sufficiently cost-effective and efficient that customers choose to install such systems on their homes or businesses.  This may render traditional generation sources owned by Idaho Power obsolete or decrease the need for energy supplied by Idaho Power, which would reduce Idaho Power's revenue and have a negative impact on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition.   Capital expenditures for power generation and delivery infrastructure and replacement of that infrastructure, and the timing and availability of cost recovery for those expenditures, can significantly affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  Idaho Power’s business is capital intensive and requires significant investments in energy generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure.  Long-term increases in both the number of customers and the demand for energy require expansion and reinforcement of that infrastructure.  For instance, Idaho Power is in the permitting process for two 500-kV transmission line projects.  Construction projects are subject to usual construction risks that can adversely affect project costs and completion time.  These risks include the ability to obtain labor or materials; increases in cost of labor and materials; contractor defaults; equipment, engineering, and design failures; adverse weather conditions; lack of availability of financing; the ability to obtain and comply with permits and land use rights; environmental constraints; 20Table of Contentsdisputes and litigation with third parties; and changes in applicable laws or regulations.  If Idaho Power is unable to complete the construction of a project, or incurs costs that regulators do not deem prudent, it may not be able to recover its costs in full through rates.  Even if Idaho Power completes a construction project, the total costs may be higher than estimated and/or higher than amounts approved for recovery by regulators.  If Idaho Power does not receive timely regulatory recovery of costs associated with those expansion and reinforcement activities, Idaho Power will have to rely more heavily on external debt or equity financing for its future capital expenditures.  These large capital expenditures may weaken the consolidated financial profile of IDACORP and Idaho Power.  Additionally, a significant portion of Idaho Power’s facilities were constructed many years ago, which could affect reliability, increase repair and maintenance expenses, and increase reliance on market purchases of power, which may negatively affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  Further, if Idaho Power were unable to secure permits or joint funding commitments to develop transmission infrastructure necessary to serve loads, such as the Boardman-to-Hemingway transmission line, it may terminate those projects and, as an alternative, develop additional generation facilities within areas where Idaho Power has available transmission capacity or pursue other more costly options to serve loads.  Termination of a project carries with it the potential for a write-off of all or a significant portion of the costs associated with the project if state public utility commissions deny recovery of costs they deem imprudently incurred, which could negatively affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.Idaho Power’s business is subject to an extensive set of environmental laws, rules, and regulations, which could impact Idaho Power's operations and increase costs of operations, potentially rendering some generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate, and could increase the costs and alter the timing of major projects.  A number of federal, state, and local environmental statutes, rules, and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, natural resources, and health and safety are applicable to Idaho Power's operations.  These laws and regulations generally require Idaho Power to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections, and other approvals, and may be enforced by both public officials and private individuals.  Some of these regulations are changing or subject to interpretation, and failure to comply may result in penalties or other adverse consequences.  Environmental regulations have created the need for Idaho Power to install new pollution control equipment at, and may cause Idaho Power to perform environmental remediation on, its owned or co-owned facilities, often at a substantial cost.  For instance, Idaho Power plans to install environmental control apparatus at its co-owned Jim Bridger power plant in 2015 and 2016 at a cost of approximately $120 million, and a second set of control apparatus in 2021 and 2022.  Idaho Power expects that there will be other costs relating to environmental regulations, and those costs are likely to be substantial.  Idaho Power is not guaranteed recovery of those costs.  For instance, in December 2012 the Oregon Public Utility Commission disallowed in part cost recovery for certain environmental upgrades made to a coal plant by one of Idaho Power's Northwest region peer utilities, citing an insufficient cost analysis.  If Idaho Power is similarly unable to recover in full its costs through the ratemaking process, such non-recovery would negatively impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  Moreover, there are many legislative and rulemaking initiatives pending at the federal and state level that are aimed at the reduction of fossil fuel plant emissions.  Idaho Power cannot predict the outcome of pending or future legislative and rulemaking proposals, or the compliance costs Idaho Power would incur in connection with that legislation.  Future changes in environmental laws or regulations governing emissions reduction may make certain electric generating units (especially coal-fired units) uneconomical and subject to shut-down, may require the adoption of new methodologies or technologies that significantly increase costs or delay in-service dates, and may raise uncertainty about the future viability of fossil fuels as an energy source for new and existing electric generation facilities.  Furthermore, Idaho Power may not be able to obtain or maintain all environmental regulatory approvals necessary for operation of its facilities and execution of its long-term strategy, including construction of new transmission and distribution infrastructure.  If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if Idaho Power fails to obtain, maintain, or comply with any such approval, construction and/or operation of Idaho Power's generation or transmission facilities could be delayed, halted, or subjected to additional costs.  At the same time, consumer preference for renewable or low greenhouse gas-emitting sources of energy could impact the desirability of generation from existing sources and require significant investment in new generation and transmission resources.  Relicensing of the Hells Canyon hydroelectric project and construction of the proposed Gateway West and Boardman-to-Hemingway transmission lines requires consultation under the Endangered Species Act to determine the effects of these projects on any listed species within the project areas.  The listing of species as threatened or endangered will result in a costly Endangered Species Act consultation for the two transmission projects and for any future transmission projects.  Similarly, the presence of sage grouse in the vicinity of the Gateway West and Boardman-to-Hemingway transmission projects has required more extensive, costly, and time consuming evaluation and engineering.  These and other requirements of the Endangered 21Table of ContentsSpecies Act, Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and similar environmental laws may increase costs, the timing or ability to complete major projects, and reduce earnings and cash flows.Factors contributing to lower hydroelectric generation can increase costs and negatively impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  Idaho Power derives a significant portion of its power supply from its hydroelectric facilities.  Because of Idaho Power’s heavy reliance on hydroelectric generation, snowpack, the timing of run-off, and the availability of water in the Snake River basin can significantly affect its operations.  The combination of declining Snake River base flows, over-appropriation of water, and periods of drought have led to water rights disputes and proceedings among surface water and ground water irrigators and the State of Idaho.  Recharging the Eastern Snake Plain aquifer by diverting surface water to porous locations and permitting it to sink into the aquifer is one proposed solution to the over-appropriation dispute.  Diversions from the Snake River for aquifer recharge or the loss of water rights may further reduce Snake River flows available for hydroelectric generation.  When hydroelectric generation is reduced, Idaho Power must increase its use of more expensive thermal generating resources and purchased power; therefore, costs increase and opportunities for off-system sales are reduced, reducing earnings.  Through its power cost adjustment mechanisms, Idaho Power expects to recover most of the increase in net power supply costs caused by lower hydroelectric generation.  Recovery of the increased costs, however, may not occur until the subsequent power cost adjustment year, negatively affecting cash flows and liquidity.Conditions imposed in connection with hydroelectric license renewals may require large capital expenditures, increase operating costs, reduce hydroelectric generation, and negatively affect IDACORP's or Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition.  For the last several years, Idaho Power has been engaged in an effort to renew its federal license for its largest hydroelectric generation source, the Hells Canyon Complex.  Relicensing includes an extensive public review process that involves numerous natural resource issues and environmental conditions.  The listing of various species of marine life, wildlife, and plants as threatened or endangered has resulted in significant changes to federally-authorized activities, including those of hydroelectric projects.  In particular, fish and other marine life recovery plans may require major operational changes to the region’s hydroelectric projects.  In addition, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to hydroelectric facilities, which could further increase required expenditures for marine life recovery and endangered species protection and reduce the amount of hydroelectric generation available to meet Idaho Power’s energy requirements. In 2007, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Staff issued a final environmental impact statement for the Hells Canyon Complex, which the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will use in part to determine whether, and under what conditions, to issue a new license for the Hells Canyon Complex.  Certain portions of the final environmental impact statement involve issues that may be influenced by water quality certifications for the project under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act and formal consultations under the Endangered Species Act, which remain unresolved.  One significant issue involves water temperature gradients, and certain parties in the relicensing proceedings have advocated for the installation of water temperature management apparatus which, if required to be installed, would require substantial capital expenditures to construct and maintain.  Idaho Power may be unable to recover in full the costs of such an apparatus through rates, particularly given the magnitude of any potential impact on customer rates.  Idaho Power also cannot predict the requirements that might be imposed during the relicensing process, the financial impact of those requirements, or whether a new multi-year license will ultimately be issued.  Imposition of onerous conditions in the relicensing process could result in Idaho Power incurring significant capital expenditures, increase operating costs, and reduce hydroelectric generation, which could negatively affect results of operations and financial condition.IDACORP's and Idaho Power's operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations, and unusually mild temperatures can impact their results of operations and financial condition.  Electric power sales are generally seasonal, with demand in Idaho Power's service territory peaking during the hot summer months, with a secondary peak during the cold winter months.  The loads required by irrigation customers in Idaho Power's service territory can also create significant seasonal changes in usage.  When temperatures are relatively mild, loads are often lower as customers are not using electricity for heating and air conditioning purposes.  Thus, unusually mild weather or the timing and extent of precipitation in the future could adversely impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition.  Complying with state or federal renewable portfolio standards could increase capital expenditures and operating costs and adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition.  A number of states have adopted renewable portfolio standards, which require that electricity providers obtain a minimum percentage of their power from renewable energy sources by a specified date.  Idaho Power’s operations in Oregon will be required to comply with a ten percent renewable portfolio standard beginning in 2025, and it is possible that other states, including Idaho, could adopt renewable portfolio standards.  The cost of purchasing or generating power from renewable energy sources is often greater than 22Table of Contentsfossil fuel and hydroelectric generation sources, and construction of renewable energy facilities involves significant capital expenditures.  As a result, new state or federal renewable portfolio standards could increase capital expenditures and operating costs and negatively affect results of operations and financial condition.Idaho Power’s reliance on coal and natural gas to fuel its non-hydroelectric power generation facilities exposes it to the risk of increased costs and reduced earnings.  As part of its normal business operations, Idaho Power purchases coal and natural gas in the open market or under short-term, long-term, or variable-priced contracts.  Market prices for coal and natural gas are influenced by factors impacting supply and demand such as weather conditions, fuel transportation availability, economic conditions, and changes in technology.  Most of Idaho Power's coal supply arrangements are for coal originating in Wyoming and any disruption of coal production in, or transportation from, that region may cause Idaho Power to incur additional fuel supply costs or use alternative generation sources or wholesale market power purchases.  Natural gas transportation to Idaho Power's natural gas plants is limited to one primary pipeline, presenting a heightened possibility of supply disruptions.  Idaho Power is also exposed to the risk that its counterparties to fuel purchase arrangements will default on their obligations, causing Idaho Power to seek alternative sources of fuel or rely on other generation sources or wholesale market power purchases.  Idaho Power may not be able to fully recover these increased costs through rates or its power cost adjustment mechanisms, which may adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  Idaho Power’s generation, transmission, and distribution facilities are subject to numerous operational risks unique to it and its industry.  Operating risks associated with Idaho Power's generation, transmission, and distribution facilities include equipment failures, volatility in fuel and transportation pricing, interruptions in fuel supplies, increased regulatory compliance costs, labor disputes, accidents and workforce safety matters, release of hazardous or toxic substances into the air or water, the failure of a hydroelectric facility, the loss of cost-effective disposal options for solid waste, operator error, and the occurrence of catastrophic events at the facilities.  Diminished availability or performance of those facilities could result in reduced customer satisfaction and regulatory inquiries and fines.  Operation of Idaho Power's owned and co-owned generating stations below expected capacity levels, or unplanned outages at these stations, could cause reduced energy output and lower efficiency levels and result in lost revenues and increased expenses for alternative fuels or wholesale market power purchases.  Accidents, fires, explosions, system damage or dysfunction, and other unplanned events related to Idaho Power's infrastructure may expose Idaho Power to claims for personal injury or property damage.  Further, the transmission system in Idaho Power's service territory is constrained, limiting the ability to transmit electric energy within the service territory and access electric energy from outside the service territory during high-load periods.  The transmission constraints could result in failure to provide reliable service to customers and the inability to deliver energy from generating facilities to the power grid, or not being able to access lower cost sources of electric energy, which could have a negative effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  Volatility in the financial markets, or denial of regulatory authority to issue debt or equity securities, may negatively affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s ability to access capital and/or increase their cost of borrowing, or result in losses on investments.  IDACORP and Idaho Power require liquidity to pay operating expenses and principal of, and interest on, debt and to finance capital expenditures not satisfied by cash flows from operations.  Financial markets have in recent years experienced extreme volatility and disruption, most recently as a result of the European sovereign debt situation, generally resulting in a decrease in the availability of liquidity and credit for borrowers.  In a volatile credit environment, Idaho Power may be unable to issue long-term indebtedness at reasonable interest rates or at all, one or more of the participating banks in IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s credit facilities may default on their obligations to make loans under, or may withdraw from, the credit facilities, or IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s access to capital may otherwise be inhibited.  In addition, at times Idaho Power has a relatively large balance of short-term investments.  Volatility in the financial markets may result in a lack of liquidity for short-term investments and declines in value of some investments.  The occurrence of any of these events could affect Idaho Power's ability to execute its business plan and adversely affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s results of operations and financial condition.  Further, Idaho Power is required to obtain regulatory approval in Idaho, Oregon, and Wyoming in order to borrow money or to issue securities and is therefore dependent on the public utility commissions of those states to issue favorable orders in a timely manner to permit them to finance their operations.  Notably, without additional approval from those commissions, the aggregate amount of short-term borrowings by Idaho Power at any one time outstanding may not exceed $450 million. A downgrade in IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s credit ratings could affect the companies’ ability to access capital, increase their cost of borrowing, and require the companies to post collateral with transaction counterparties.  Access to capital markets is important to IDACORP's and Idaho Power's ability to operate and to complete capital projects, including its planned transmission projects.  Credit rating agencies periodically review the corporate credit ratings and long-term ratings of IDACORP and Idaho Power, and these ratings impact access to, and the cost of, borrowing.  IDACORP and Idaho Power also have borrowing arrangements that rely on the ability of the banks to fund loans or support commercial paper, a principal source 23Table of Contentsof short-term financing.  Downgrades of IDACORP’s or Idaho Power’s credit ratings, or those affecting relationship banks, could limit the companies’ ability to access capital, including commercial paper markets, require the companies to pay a higher interest rate on their debt, and require the companies to post additional performance assurance collateral with transaction counterparties.Idaho Power’s risk management policy and programs relating to economically hedging power and gas exposures, financial and interest rate risk, and counterparty creditworthiness may not always perform as intended, and as a result IDACORP and Idaho Power may suffer economic losses.  Idaho Power enters into transactions to hedge its positions in coal, natural gas, power, and other commodities, and enters into financial hedges.  IDACORP and Idaho Power could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market value of these contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform.  The derivative instruments might not offset the underlying exposure being mitigated as intended, due to pricing inefficiencies or other terms of the derivative instruments, and any such failure to mitigate exposure could result in financial losses.  Further, forecasts of future fuel needs and loads and available resources to meet those loads are inherently uncertain and may cause Idaho Power to over- or under-hedge actual resource needs, exposing the company to market risk on the over- or under-hedged position.  As a result, risk management actions may adversely affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s financial condition and results of operations.  Idaho Power could be subject to penalties and operational changes if it violates mandatory reliability and security requirements, which could adversely impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition.  As an owner and operator of a bulk power transmission system, Idaho Power is subject to mandatory reliability standards issued by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and enforced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles.  Compliance with reliability standards subjects Idaho Power to higher operating costs and increased capital expenditures.  Further, Idaho Power has received in recent years notices of violations from, and self-reported reliability standard compliance issues to, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and the Western Electricity Coordinating Council, and has several matters pending.  Potential monetary and non-monetary penalties for a violation of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulations may be substantial, and in some circumstances monetary penalties may be as high as $1 million per day per violation.  The imposition of penalties on Idaho Power could have a negative effect on its and IDACORP’s results of operations and financial condition.    Federally mandated purchases of power from PURPA power projects, and integration of power generated from those projects into Idaho Power's system, may increase costs and decrease system reliability, and adversely affect Idaho Power's and IDACORP's results of operations and financial condition.  An abundance of intermittent, non-dispatchable wind power generation at times when Idaho Power has available lower-cost resources to meet load demands has an impact on the operation of Idaho Power's hydroelectric generation plants, system reliability, power supply costs, and the wholesale power markets in the Pacific Northwest.  Wind power generated from PURPA projects, which Idaho Power is generally obligated to purchase regardless of the then-current load demand or wholesale energy market prices, increases the likelihood and frequency that Idaho Power will be required to reduce output from its lower-cost hydroelectric and fossil fuel-fired generation resources, increasing power purchase costs.  Further, balancing load and generation from Idaho Power's power generation portfolio is challenging, and Idaho Power expects that its operational costs will increase as a result of its efforts to integrate intermittent, non-dispatchable power from a large number of PURPA power projects.  Recent efforts to obtain further authorization to curtail certain intermittent power sources during light-load times have been unsuccessful.  Idaho Power anticipates that costs will escalate as the volume of wind and other intermittent power on Idaho Power's system increases, which may negatively affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition. The performance of pension and postretirement benefit plan investments and other factors impacting plan costs and funding obligations could adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations - primarily cash flows and liquidity.  Idaho Power provides a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering most employees, as well as a defined benefit postretirement benefit plan (consisting of health care and death benefits) that covers eligible retirees.  Costs of providing these benefits are based in part on the value of the plans' assets and, therefore, adverse investment performance for these assets could increase Idaho Power’s plan costs and funding requirements related to the plans.  The key actuarial assumptions that affect funding obligations are the expected long-term return on plan assets and the discount rate used in determining future benefit obligations.  Idaho Power evaluates the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis, taking into account changes in market conditions, trends, and future expectations.  Estimates of future equity and debt market performance, changes in interest rates, and other factors Idaho Power and its actuary firms use to develop the actuarial assumptions are inherently uncertain, and actual results could vary significantly from the estimates.  Changes in demographics, including  timing of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase Idaho Power's plan costs and funding requirements.  Future pension funding requirements and the timing of funding payments are also subject to the impacts of changes in legislation.  Depending on the timing of contributions to the plans and Idaho Power's ability to recover costs through 24Table of Contentsrates, cash contributions to the plans could reduce the cash available for operating activities.  For additional information regarding Idaho Power's funding obligations under its benefit plans, see Note 11 - ""Benefit Plans"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.   As a holding company, IDACORP does not have its own operating income and must rely on the cash flows from its subsidiaries to pay dividends and make debt payments.  IDACORP is a holding company with no significant operations of its own, and its primary assets are shares or other ownership interests of its subsidiaries, primarily Idaho Power.  IDACORP’s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts to IDACORP, whether through dividends, loans, or other payments.  The ability of IDACORP’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to IDACORP depends on several factors, including each subsidiary's actual and projected earnings and cash flow, capital requirements and general financial condition, regulatory restrictions, covenants contained in credit facilities to which they are parties, and the prior rights of holders of their existing and future first mortgage bonds and other debt or equity securities.  Further, the amount and payment of dividends is at the discretion of the board of directors, which may reduce or cease payment of dividends at any time.  See Item 5 - ""Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities"" in this report for a further description of restrictions on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's payment of dividends.  Changes in tax laws and regulations, or differing interpretation or enforcement of applicable laws by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdictions, could have a material adverse impact on IDACORP’s or Idaho Power’s financial condition and results of operations.  IDACORP and Idaho Power must make judgments and interpretations about the application of the law when determining the provision for taxes.  The companies’ tax obligations include income, real estate, public utility, municipal, sales and use, business and occupation, and employment-related taxes and ongoing issues related to these taxes.  These judgments may include reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that may be subject to challenge by taxing authorities.  In recent years, tax settlements, as well as state regulatory mechanisms with tax-related provisions (such as Idaho Power's December 2011 settlement with the Idaho Public Utilities Commission), have significantly impacted IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations.  The outcome of ongoing and future income tax proceedings, or the state public utility commissions' treatment of those tax outcomes, could differ materially from the amounts IDACORP and Idaho Power record prior to conclusion of those proceedings, and the difference could negatively affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s earnings and cash flows.  Further, in some instances the treatment from a ratemaking perspective of any tax benefits could be different than IDACORP or Idaho Power anticipate or request from applicable state regulatory commissions, which could have a negative effect on their financial condition and results of operations.   Employee workforce factors, including the impacts of an aging workforce with specialized utility-specific functions, could increase costs and adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  Idaho Power is subject to workforce factors, including loss or retirement of key personnel, availability of qualified personnel, an aging workforce, and impacts of efforts to organize the workforce.  A unionization attempt that was launched in late-2012 failed, but does not prevent future unionization attempts.  Idaho Power’s operations require a skilled workforce to perform specialized utility functions.  Many of these positions, such as linemen, grid operators, and generation plant operators, require extensive, specialized training.  Idaho Power expects that a significant portion of its skilled workforce will be retiring within the current decade, which will require Idaho Power to attract, train, and retain skilled workers to prevent a loss of institutional knowledge and avoid a skills gap.  Without a skilled workforce, Idaho Power’s ability to provide quality service to its customers and meet regulatory requirements will be challenging, which could negatively affect earnings.  The costs associated with attracting and retaining appropriately qualified employees to replace an aging and skilled workforce could have a negative effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations. IDACORP and Idaho Power are subject to costs and other effects of legal and regulatory proceedings, disputes, and claims.  From time to time in the normal course of business IDACORP and Idaho Power are subject to various lawsuits, regulatory proceedings, disputes, and claims that could result in adverse judgments or settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, or other relief.  These matters are subject to a number of uncertainties, and as a result management is often unable to predict the outcome of a matter.  As an example, over the past decade Idaho Power has been a party to proceedings relating to high prices for electricity, energy shortages, and blackouts in California and in western wholesale markets during 2000 and 2001, which caused numerous purchasers of electricity in those markets to initiate proceedings seeking refunds or other forms of relief and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to initiate its own investigations.  While Idaho Power has largely disposed of direct claims in those proceedings, the settlements and associated Federal Energy Regulatory Commission orders did not eliminate the potential for speculative ""ripple claims,"" which involve potential claims for refunds from an upstream seller of power based on a finding that its downstream buyer was liable for refunds as a seller of power during the relevant period.  Idaho Power's settlement payments in those proceedings have been relatively small to date, but the legal costs of defending the claims over the past decade have been substantial.  In recent years, Idaho Power has also been a party to legal proceedings advanced by private 25Table of Contentsparties relating to alleged violations of environmental laws at coal-fired plants.  The legal costs and final resolution of matters in which IDACORP or Idaho Power are involved could have a negative effect on their financial condition and results of operations.  Similarly, the terms of resolution could require the companies to change their business practices and procedures, which could also have a negative affect on their financial positions and results of operations.Acts or threats of terrorism, cyber attacks, security breaches, and other acts of individuals or groups seeking to disrupt Idaho Power's operations, or the businesses of third parties, could negatively impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.  Idaho Power's generation and transmission facilities are potential targets for terrorist acts and threats, as well as cyber attacks and other disruptive activities of individuals or groups.  Some of Idaho Power's facilities are deemed ""critical infrastructure,"" in that incapacity or destruction of the facilities could have a debilitating impact on security, reliability or operability of the bulk electric power system, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.  The possibility that infrastructure facilities, such as generation facilities and electric transmission facilities, would be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror or cyber attack (whether originating internally or externally) may affect Idaho Power's operations by limiting the ability to generate, purchase, or transmit power and by delaying the development and construction of new generating and transmission facilities and capital improvements to existing facilities.  These events, and governmental actions in response, could result in a material decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to repair and insure Idaho Power's assets, and could further adversely affect Idaho Power's operations by contributing to disruption of supplies and markets for natural gas or coal used to fuel gas- or coal-fired power plants.  In the normal course of business, Idaho Power collects, processes, and retains sensitive and confidential customer and proprietary information, and operates systems that directly impact the availability of electric power and the transmission of electric power in the electric grid.  Despite the security measures in place, Idaho Power's facilities and systems could be vulnerable to security breaches, data leakage, or other similar events that could interrupt operations, exposing Idaho Power to liability.  Those breaches and events may result from acts of Idaho Power employees, contractors, or third parties.  If Idaho Power's information technology and security systems were to fail or be breached and Idaho Power were unable to recover the systems and/or data in a timely manner, Idaho Power may be unable to fulfill critical business functions.  In such case, confidential and proprietary business, employee, or customer information could be compromised, exposing Idaho Power to liability and causing business disruptions, which could negatively affect Idaho Power's business operations and IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial condition and results of operations.   Idaho Power's business and operations may be adversely affected by its inability to successfully implement current information technology projects.  Idaho Power is currently undertaking several multi-year company-wide information technology solution upgrades intended to replace existing software and systems.  These projects include a new customer information system,  Idaho Power's SmartGrid initiative, and migration from Idaho Power's existing mainframe system to an open system.  Idaho Power is also implementing systems to augment and improve its ability to pinpoint the sources of electric system outages, respond to them more quickly, and focus repair efforts.  Implementation of these information systems and technology solutions is complex, expensive, and time consuming.  If Idaho Power does not successfully implement the new systems and processes, or if the systems do not operate as intended or cause data or operational errors, it could result in substantial disruptions to Idaho Power's business, which could have a material adverse effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and financial condition.Changes in accounting standards or Securities and Exchange Commission rules may impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial results and disclosures.  The Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission may make changes to accounting standards that impact presentation and disclosures of financial condition and results of operations.    Further, new accounting orders issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission could significantly impact IDACORP's and Idaho Power's reported financial condition.  Idaho Power meets conditions under generally accepted accounting principles to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in its financial statements and to defer certain costs as regulatory assets until those costs are collected in rates, and to defer some items as regulatory liabilities.  Idaho Power expects to recover its regulatory assets from customers through rates but recovery is subject to review by the regulatory bodies.  If recovery of these amounts ceases to be probable, if Idaho Power determines that it no longer meets the criteria for applying regulatory accounting, or if accounting rules change to no longer provide for regulatory assets and liabilities, Idaho Power could be required to eliminate those regulatory assets or liabilities.  Any of these circumstances could result in write-offs and have a material effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power’s reported financial condition and results of operations"
12,IDA,IDACORP INC,2012-02-22,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the risk factors set forth below may have a significant impact on the business, financial condition, or results of operations of IDACORP and Idaho Power and could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in any forward-looking statements. If the Idaho Public Utilities Commission, the Oregon Public Utility Commission, or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission grant less rate recovery in regulatory proceedings than Idaho Power needs to cover existing and future costs and earn a rate of return, earnings and cash flows may be reduced.  The prices that the Idaho Public Utilities Commission and Oregon Public Utility Commission authorize Idaho Power to charge for its retail services, and the tariff rate that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission permits Idaho Power to charge for transmission, are generally the most significant factors influencing IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.  The Idaho Public Utilities Commission and Oregon Public Utility Commission have the authority to disallow recovery of any costs that they consider unreasonable or imprudently incurred.  Also, the rates allowed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for transmission service may be insufficient for recovery of costs incurred.  While the Idaho Public Utilities Commission and Oregon Public Utility Commission have established an authorized rate of return for Idaho Power, the regulatory process does not provide assurance that Idaho Power will be able to achieve the authorized rate of return.  Further, while the Idaho Public Utilities Commission and Oregon Public Utility Commission are required to establish rates that are fair, just, and reasonable, they have considerable discretion in applying this standard.  The ratemaking process typically involves multiple parties, including governmental bodies, consumer advocacy groups, and customers.  While each party has differing concerns, they often have the common objective of limiting rate increases or even reducing rates.  Idaho Power cannot predict the outcome of ratemaking proceedings, including the extent to which costs, including the costs of significant capital projects, will be recovered or what rates of return will be authorized.  The failure of Idaho Power to recover those costs, or recover them in a timely manner, may decrease IDACORP's and Idaho Power's earnings and adversely impact cash flows.  For additional information relating to Idaho Power's regulatory framework, see Note 3 - ""Regulatory Matters"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report and ""Regulatory Matters"" in Part II, Item 7 - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in this report. Idaho Power's cost recovery deferral mechanisms may not function as intended, which may adversely affect cash flows and liquidity.  Idaho Power has power cost adjustment mechanisms that provide for periodic adjustments to the rates charged to its Idaho and Oregon retail customers.  The power cost adjustment tracks Idaho Power’s actual net power supply costs (primarily fuel and purchased power less off-system sales) and compares these amounts to net power supply costs currently being recovered in retail rates.  A majority, but not all, of the variance between these two amounts is deferred for future recovery from, or refund to, customers.  Accordingly, the power cost adjustment mechanisms only partially offset the potentially adverse financial impacts of forced generating plant outages, severe weather, reduced hydroelectric generation, and volatile wholesale energy prices.  Because of the power cost adjustment mechanisms, the primary financial impact of power supply cost variations is on the timing of cash flows.  When costs rise above the level recovered in retail base rates it adversely affects Idaho Power’s operating cash flow and liquidity until those costs are recovered from customers.  Idaho Power also has a fixed cost adjustment, which began as a pilot program for Idaho Power’s Idaho residential and small general service customers, running from 2007 through 2011.  The fixed cost adjustment is designed to remove Idaho Power’s disincentive to invest in energy efficiency programs by separating (or decoupling) the recovery of fixed costs from the variable kilowatt-hour charge, and linking it instead to a set amount per customer.  In October 2011, Idaho Power filed an application with the Idaho Public Utilities Commission requesting that the fixed cost adjustment pilot program become permanent.  As of the date of this report, the Idaho Public Utilities Commission has not issued a determination.  If the fixed cost adjustment is not approved as permanent, or if the Idaho Public Utilities Commission modifies the fixed cost adjustment in some manner, Idaho Power may incur fixed costs that may not be recoverable in rates in times of declining usage per residential and small general service customer, or may recover more than the fixed costs incurred in times of increasing usage per residential and small general service customer.  This over- or under-collection of fixed costs would likely continue until Idaho Power's next Idaho general rate case when the recovery of fixed costs through base rates can be realigned, which could adversely affect Idaho Power's cash flows and liquidity.For additional information relating to Idaho Power's regulatory framework and cost recovery mechanisms, see Note 3 - ""Regulatory Matters"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report and ""Regulatory Matters"" in Part II, Item 7 - ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in this report. 18Reduced hydroelectric generation can reduce revenues and increase costs, and reduce earnings and cash flows.  Idaho Power derives a significant portion of its power supply from its hydroelectric facilities.  Because of Idaho Power’s heavy reliance on hydroelectric generation, the availability of water can significantly affect its operations.  When hydroelectric generation is reduced, Idaho Power must increase its use of generally more expensive thermal generating resources and purchased power; therefore, opportunities for off-system sales are reduced, which reduces revenues.  The further integration of wind and other intermittent power sources into Idaho Power's system may also displace lower cost hydroelectric resources.  Integration of intermittent power sources may also increase costs at thermal plants due to wear and tear associated with frequent start-up and shut-down of those facilities to balance loads.  While Idaho Power expects to recover, as a result of its power cost adjustment mechanisms, the majority of its net power supply costs above current rates (including the power cost adjustment forecast), recovery of the excess amounts may not occur until the subsequent power cost adjustment year, impacting cash flows and liquidity. Declines in stream flows and over-appropriation of water in Idaho may reduce hydroelectric generation and revenues and increase costs, and reduce earnings and cash flows.  The combination of declining Snake River base flows, over-appropriation of water, and periods of drought have led to water rights disputes and proceedings among surface water and ground water irrigators and the State of Idaho.  Recharging the Eastern Snake Plain aquifer by diverting surface water to porous locations and permitting it to sink into the aquifer is one proposed solution to the over-appropriation dispute.  Diversions from the Snake River for aquifer recharge or the loss of water rights may further reduce Snake River flows available for hydroelectric generation.  Idaho Power’s January 2010 settlement agreement with the State of Idaho resolves litigation regarding certain Idaho Power water rights on the Snake River and provides for ongoing Snake River water issues to be addressed in a comprehensive aquifer management plan process.  However, there is no assurance that this process will lead to increased Snake River stream flows for Idaho Power’s hydroelectric projects.  The comprehensive aquifer management plan process and the resolution of pending proceedings relating to the Snake River may affect Snake River flows available for hydroelectric generation and thereby reduce Idaho Power’s revenues and increase costs, and may reduce earnings and cash flows. Idaho Power’s reliance on coal and natural gas to fuel its power generation facilities exposes it to risk of increased costs and reduced earnings.  In addition to hydroelectric generation, Idaho Power relies on coal and natural gas to fuel its generation facilities.  As part of its normal business operations, Idaho Power purchases power and natural gas in the open market or under short-term, long-term, or variable-priced contracts.  Market prices for coal and natural gas are influenced by factors impacting supply and demand, such as weather conditions, fuel transmission or transportation availability, economic conditions, and changes in technology.  Increases in demand for coal or natural gas may result in market price increases, short-term price volatility, and supply availability issues.  Any disruption in Idaho Power’s fuel supply may require the company to find alternative fuel sources at higher costs, to produce power from higher cost generation facilities, or to purchase power from other sources at higher costs.  Idaho Power may not be able to fully recover these increased costs through ratemaking, which may reduce earnings.  Further, Idaho Power's power cost adjustment mechanisms contain a cost-sharing feature that does not in all circumstances provide for full recovery of incurred costs in customer rates.   Idaho Power’s power generating facilities are subject to numerous operational risks unique to it and its industry.  Operating risks associated with Idaho Power's generation facilities include equipment failures, volatility in fuel and transportation pricing, interruptions in fuel supplies, increased regulatory compliance costs, labor disputes, workforce safety matters, the loss of cost-effective disposal options for solid waste, operator error, and the occurrence of catastrophic events at the facilities.  Diminished availability or performance of Idaho Power's transmission and distribution facilities could result in reduced customer satisfaction and regulatory inquiries and fines.  Operation of Idaho Power's owned and co-owned generating stations below expected capacity levels, or unplanned outages at these stations, could cause reduced energy output and lower efficiency levels and result in lost revenues and increased expenses.  These operational risks may result in plant outages, as well as increased operation and maintenance expenses, power generation costs, and power purchase costs, which could have an adverse impact on earnings and cash flows.  Load changes in Idaho Power’s service territory expose Idaho Power to greater market and operational risk and could increase costs and reduce earnings and cash flows.  While Idaho Power’s customer growth rate has slowed in recent years, increases in both the number of customers and the demand for energy have resulted and may continue to result in increased reliance on purchased power to meet peak system demand.  While Idaho Power is exploring targeted opportunities for managed load growth, load growth can create planning and operating difficulties for Idaho Power that can negatively impact its ability to reliably serve customers.  Through current regulatory mechanisms, Idaho Power can expect to recover the majority of the net power supply costs above the amounts included in its rates, though recovery of the excess amounts does not occur until the subsequent power cost adjustment year, and the remaining amount is absorbed by Idaho Power, which could increase costs and reduce earnings and cash flows.  Load growth can also result in the need for additional investments in Idaho Power’s infrastructure to serve the new load.  For instance, to meet customer demand Idaho Power is currently constructing its Langley 19Gulch natural gas-fired generating plant, and has in development a number of transmission projects.  If Idaho Power is unable to secure timely rate relief from the Idaho Public Utilities Commission, the Oregon Public Utility Commission, or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to recover the costs of these additional investments, the resulting disconnect between the time investments are made and costs are recovered would have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows.  Further, while Idaho Power has experienced a general trend of load growth in its service territory in recent years, increased emphasis on energy efficiency and weak economic conditions could result in a decline in loads, which may decrease Idaho Power's revenues from energy sales.  Also, Idaho Power's regulatory mechanisms, including its load change adjustment rate included in its power cost adjustment, may not result in Idaho Power recovering all of its costs associated with load decreases, which would have a negative impact on earnings and cash flows. Federally mandated purchases of power from PURPA power purchase projects, and integration of power generated from those projects into Idaho Power's system, may increase costs and decrease system reliability, and adversely affect cash flows, financial condition, and earnings.  An abundance of intermittent, non-dispatchable wind power generation at times when Idaho Power has available lower-cost resources to meet load demands has an impact on the operation of Idaho Power's hydroelectric generation plants, system reliability, power supply costs, and the wholesale power markets in the Pacific Northwest.  Wind power generated from PURPA projects, which Idaho Power is generally obligated to purchase regardless of the then-current load demand or wholesale energy market prices, increases the likelihood and frequency that Idaho Power will be required to reduce output from its lower-cost hydroelectric and fossil fuel-fired generation resources, even when weather conditions have resulted in favorable hydroelectric generation conditions or fuel prices are low.  Wind generation in the Pacific Northwest during periods when abundant hydroelectric generation is also available reduces wholesale market prices.  This may result in Idaho Power's sale of excess wind power at a significant discount to the price Idaho Power paid for the wind power under PURPA wind power purchase contracts.  It may also result in the sale of excess lower-cost hydroelectric or fuel-based power at depressed wholesale market prices.  When forecasted wind or other intermittent resources do not materialize, Idaho Power must obtain a substitute source of power to meet load demand, and often must purchase power in the wholesale power markets to balance loads.  Further, balancing load and generation from Idaho Power's power generation portfolio is challenging, and Idaho Power expects that its costs will increase as a result of its efforts to integrate intermittent, non-dispatchable power from a large number of PURPA power projects.  Idaho Power anticipates that those costs will escalate as the volume of wind and other intermittent power on Idaho Power's system increases, which may adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's cash flows, financial condition, and earnings.  Weather and climate change could affect customer demand and hydroelectric generation and disrupt transmission and distribution systems, reducing earnings and cash flows.  Warmer than normal winters, cooler than normal summers, and increased rainfall during the irrigation seasons reduce retail revenues from power sales and may impact the amount and timing of hydroelectric generation.  Changes in the amount and timing of snowpack and stream flows may also adversely affect hydroelectric generation.  Extreme weather events and their associated impacts, such as high winds and fires, can disrupt transmission and distribution systems and cause service interruptions and extended outages, increase supply chain costs, potentially interrupt use of generation resources, and limit Idaho Power's ability to meet customer energy demand.  Rapid increases in load requirements resulting from unexpected adverse weather changes, particularly if coupled with transmission constraints or system damage, could adversely impact Idaho Power's costs and ability to meet customer energy demand.  Conversely, rapid decreases in load requirements due to unexpected weather events could result in Idaho Power's sale of excess energy at depressed wholesale market prices.  Disruption in generation, transmission, and distribution systems due to weather-related factors also increases operations and maintenance expenses and reduces earnings and cash flows.  Long-term climate change could increase the likelihood and frequency of these adverse weather events.  Further, legislative and/or regulatory developments associated with climate change could affect construction plans and operations, including placing restrictions on the construction of new generation resources and the expansion of existing resources, result in closure of generation resources or installation of costly pollution control equipment, or require changes to the operation of generation resources and Idaho Power's power generation portfolio in general.  Also, consumer preference for renewable or low greenhouse gas-emitting sources of energy could impact demand from existing sources and require significant investment in new generation and transmission resources.  Any of these effects of weather and climate change could decrease revenues, increase operating costs, and reduce IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s earnings and cash flows.In Idaho Power's service territory, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, often concurrent with a seasonal increase in wholesale power market prices.  As a result, Idaho Power's operating results fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis.  In addition, Idaho Power will generally sell less power, and correspondingly have lower net income, when weather conditions in its service areas are milder.  Unusually mild weather in the future could diminish IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations and adversely affect its financial condition.20Idaho Power’s risk management policy and programs relating to economically hedging power and gas exposures, financial and interest rate risk, and counterparty creditworthiness may not always perform as intended, and as a result Idaho Power may suffer economic losses.  Idaho Power enters into transactions to hedge its positions in coal, natural gas, power, and other commodities.  These hedging transactions are impacted by a range of factors, including variations in power demand, fluctuations in market prices, and market prices for alternative commodities.  In connection with these hedging transactions, Idaho Power is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe it money will default on their obligations.  A similar risk of non-performance by third parties arises where those parties are obligated to purchase energy from, or sell energy to, Idaho Power, or are parties to commodity price risk management arrangements.  Idaho Power actively manages the market risk inherent in its energy related activities and counterparty credit positions by establishing and enforcing risk limits and risk management policies.  Idaho Power has procedures that monitor compliance with its risk management policies and programs, including verification of transactions, regular portfolio reporting of various risk management metrics, and daily counterparty credit risk analysis.  However, actual hydroelectric and thermal generation, power purchase volumes from intermittent sources, transmission availability, and market prices may be significantly different than those originally planned for when Idaho Power enters into its positions in hedging transactions.  This creates uncertainty in the appropriate amount of hedging activity to pursue.  Forecasts of future loads and available resources to meet those loads are inherently uncertain and may cause Idaho Power to over- or under-hedge actual resource needs, exposing the company to market risk on the over- or under-hedged position.  Changes in market prices are also unpredictable and can at times result in Idaho Power’s hedged positions performing less favorably than unhedged positions.  In addition, Idaho Power’s counterparty credit policies may not prevent counterparties from failing to perform, forcing the company to replace forward contracts with transactions in the open market, where the price for the particular commodity may at that time be higher.  As a result, risk management decisions may adversely affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Also, as part of IDACORP's and Idaho Power's risk management programs, they may use a variety of non-derivative and derivative financial instruments, such as swaps, futures, and forwards, to manage market risks.  They may also use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge against interest rate fluctuations related to debt.  In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of some of the derivative instruments involves management’s judgment or use of estimates.  As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of some of the contracts.  IDACORP or Idaho Power could also recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform, which could adversely affect IDACORP's or Idaho Power's results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.Idaho Power’s ability to enter into swaps and derivatives and hedge commodity and interest rate risk may be adversely affected by recent federal legislation.  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) was signed into law in July 2010.  The Dodd-Frank Act establishes regulatory jurisdiction by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission for certain swaps and derivative instruments and the users of those instruments.  A number of federal agencies, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission, must adopt rules to implement the Dodd-Frank Act.  As Idaho Power enters into swap and derivative transactions from time to time in connection with its general business operations, these rules, when implemented, could have a significant impact on Idaho Power and will likely increase the costs Idaho Power incurs in connection with its swap and derivative transactions.  Under the rules, Idaho Power may be required to post collateral to meet minimum capital and margin requirements.  The Dodd-Frank Act also requires a broad category of swaps to be cleared and traded on registered exchanges or special derivatives exchanges.  These clearing requirements would result in a significant change from Idaho Power's current practice of bilateral transactions and negotiated credit terms.  The Dodd-Frank Act outlines an elective exemption to the clearing requirements for swaps entered into by end users that are not ""major swap participants"" or ""swap dealers"" and that enter into hedges to mitigate their own commercial risk.  Although Idaho Power expects that its swaps will qualify under the end user exemption, there can be no assurance they will qualify.  Further, even if Idaho Power's swaps were to qualify under the end user exemption, it will not be exempt from all swap-related requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act, and counterparties that are swap dealers or major swap participants may seek to pass along the increased cost and margin requirements through higher prices and reductions in unsecured credit limits.  The occurrence of these events could have an adverse effect on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Capital expenditures for power generation and delivery infrastructure and replacement of that infrastructure can significantly affect liquidity.  Idaho Power’s business is capital intensive and requires significant investments in energy generation and other infrastructure projects.  Long-term increases in both the number of customers and the demand for energy require expansion and reinforcement of transmission and distribution systems, generating facilities, and other infrastructure.  For instance, Idaho Power is currently constructing the Langley Gulch power plant and is in the permitting process for two substantial 500-kV transmission line projects.  The cost of maintaining existing, aging equipment and infrastructure and 21developing new infrastructure is substantial, and involves risks relating to, among other things, cost overruns, system outages, price increases in commodities (such as steel and copper), and denial by regulatory bodies of recovery through rates of costs incurred.  Idaho Power may not be successful in limiting capital expenditures to planned amounts, particularly in the event of escalating costs for materials and labor.  If Idaho Power does not receive timely regulatory recovery of costs associated with those expansion and reinforcement activities, Idaho Power will have to rely more heavily on external debt or equity financing for its future capital expenditures.  These large capital expenditures may weaken the consolidated financial profile of IDACORP and Idaho Power.  Additionally, a significant portion of Idaho Power’s facilities were constructed many years ago, which could affect reliability, increase repair and maintenance expenses, and increase reliance on market purchases of power.   The performance of pension and postretirement benefit plan investments and other factors impacting plan costs could adversely affect cash flows and liquidity.  Idaho Power provides a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering most employees, as well as a defined benefit postretirement benefit plan (consisting of health care and death benefits) that covers eligible retirees.  Costs of providing these benefits are based in part on the value of the plans' assets and, therefore, adverse investment performance for these assets could increase Idaho Power’s funding requirements related to the plans.  The key actuarial assumptions that affect funding obligations are the expected long-term return on plan assets and the discount rate used in determining future benefit obligations.  Idaho Power evaluates the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis, taking into account changes in market conditions, trends, and future expectations.  Estimates of future equity and debt market performance, changes in interest rates, and other factors Idaho Power and its actuary firms use to develop the actuarial assumptions are uncertain, and actual results could vary significantly from the estimates.  Changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase Idaho Power's funding requirements for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans.  Future pension funding requirements, and the timing of funding payments, may also be subject to changes in legislation.  Depending on the timing of contributions to the plans and the availability of recovery of costs through rates, cash contributions to the plans could reduce the cash available for operating activities.  For additional information regarding Idaho Power's funding obligations under its benefit plans, see Note 11 - ""Benefit Plans"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.    Idaho Power’s business is subject to substantial governmental regulation, including environmental laws and mandatory reliability standards, which could increase costs.  Idaho Power is subject to an extensive body of federal and state laws, policies, and regulations, as well as regulatory actions and regulatory audits, including those of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, the Western Electricity Coordinating Council, and the public utility commissions in Idaho, Oregon, and Wyoming.  Some of these regulations are changing or subject to interpretation, and failure to comply may result in penalties or other adverse consequences.  As an owner and operator of a bulk power transmission system, Idaho Power is subject to mandatory reliability standards issued by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and enforced by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles.  Compliance with reliability standards subjects Idaho Power to higher operating costs and increased capital expenditures.  Further, Idaho Power has received notice of violations from, and self-reported reliability standard compliance issues to, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and the Western Electricity Coordinating Council, and has several matters pending.  Potential monetary and non-monetary penalties for a violation of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulations may be substantial, and in some circumstances monetary penalties may be as high as $1 million per day per violation.  The imposition of penalties on Idaho Power could have an adverse impact on its and IDACORP’s results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.    Idaho Power is also subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental statutes, rules, and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, natural resources, and health and safety.  Compliance with these environmental statutes, rules, and regulations involves significant capital and operating expenditures and carries with it the risk of penalties and fines.  These laws and regulations generally require Idaho Power to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections, and other approvals, and may be enforced by both public officials and private individuals.  Idaho Power cannot predict the outcome or effect of any action or litigation that may arise from applicable environmental regulations.  In addition, Idaho Power cannot predict with certainty the amount or timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean up costs or mitigation measures.  There is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties.  Environmental regulations may also require Idaho Power to install pollution control equipment at, or perform environmental remediation on, its or its co-owned facilities, often at a substantial cost.22Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury, and particulates from fossil fueled generating plants are potentially subject to increased regulations, controls, and mitigation expenses.  Certain federal legislators, environmental advocacy groups, and regulatory agencies in the United States have also been focusing considerable attention on CO2 and other emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change and/or regional air quality compliance.  Existing environmental regulations regarding air emissions (such as NOx, SO2, or mercury emissions), water quality, and other toxic pollutants may be revised or new climate change laws or regulations may be adopted or become applicable to Idaho Power.  Moreover, there are many legislative and rulemaking initiatives pending at the federal and state level that are aimed at the reduction of fossil fuel plant emissions.  Idaho Power cannot predict the outcome of pending or future legislative and rulemaking proposals.  Future changes in environmental laws or regulations governing emissions reduction could make certain electric generating units (especially coal-fired units) uneconomical and subject to shut-down, could require the adoption of new methodologies or technologies that significantly increase costs or delay in-service dates, and may raise uncertainty about the future viability of fossil fuels as an energy source for new and existing electric generation facilities.  Modification of existing environmental regulations or adoption of new environmental regulations may result in increased capital expenditures and could increase the cost of operating Idaho Power's generating plants or make them uneconomical to operate and result in reduced earnings and cash flows.Furthermore, Idaho Power may not be able to obtain or maintain all environmental regulatory approvals necessary for operation of its facilities and execution of its long-term strategy, including construction of new transmission and distribution infrastructure.  If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if Idaho Power fails to obtain, maintain, or comply with any such approval, construction and/or operation of Idaho Power's owned or co-owned generation and/or transmission facilities could be delayed, halted, or subjected to additional costs. Complying with state or federal renewable portfolio standards could increase capital expenditures and operating costs and reduce earnings and cash flows.  A number of states have adopted renewable portfolio standards, which require that electricity providers obtain a minimum percentage of their power from renewable energy sources by a specified date.  Idaho Power’s operations in Oregon will be required to comply with a ten percent renewable portfolio standard beginning in 2025, and it is possible that other states, including Idaho, could adopt renewable portfolio standards that are applicable to Idaho Power in the future.  The cost of purchasing or generating power from renewable energy sources is often greater than fossil fuel and hydroelectric generation sources, and construction of renewable energy facilities involves significant capital expenditures.  As a result, new state or federal renewable portfolio standards could increase capital expenditures and operating costs and reduce earnings and cash flows. The listing as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act of fish, wildlife, or plant species that are found in the areas of Idaho Power’s generation facilities or transmission lines may require mitigation, affect the location of a project or the ability to construct a project, and increase capital expenditures and operating costs.  Relicensing of the Hells Canyon and Swan Falls hydroelectric projects and construction of the Gateway West and Boardman-to-Hemingway transmission lines requires consultation under the Endangered Species Act to determine the effects of these projects on any listed species within the project areas.  The listing of species as threatened or endangered, including the relatively recent listing of slickspot peppergrass as a threatened species, will result in an Endangered Species Act consultation for the Gateway West and Boardman-to-Hemingway transmission lines and future transmission projects.  Similarly, the presence of sage grouse in the vicinity of the Gateway West and Boardman-to-Hemingway transmission projects has required more extensive, costly, and time consuming evaluation and engineering.  These and other requirements of the Endangered Species Act and similar laws may increase costs and reduce earnings and cash flows. Conditions imposed in connection with hydroelectric license renewals may require large capital expenditures, increase operating costs, reduce hydroelectric generation, and reduce earnings and cash flows.  Idaho Power is currently involved in renewing federal licenses for some of its hydroelectric projects, including its largest hydroelectric generation source, the Hells Canyon Complex.  Relicensing includes an extensive public review process that involves numerous natural resource issues and environmental conditions.  The listing of various species of marine life, wildlife, and plants as threatened or endangered has resulted in significant changes to federally-authorized activities, including those of hydroelectric projects.  In particular, fish and other marine life recovery plans may require major operational changes to the region’s hydroelectric projects.  In addition, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to hydroelectric facilities, which could further increase required expenditures for marine life recovery and endangered species protection and reduce the amount of hydroelectric generation available to meet Idaho Power’s energy requirements. In 2007, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Staff issued a final environmental impact statement for the Hells Canyon Complex, which the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will use in part to determine whether, and under what conditions, to issue a new license for the Hells Canyon Complex.  Certain portions of the final environmental impact statement involve 23issues that may be influenced by water quality certifications for the project under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act and formal consultations under the Endangered Species Act, which remain unresolved.  One significant issue involves water temperature gradients, and certain parties in the Hells Canyon Complex relicensing proceedings have advocated for the installation of water temperature management apparatus which, if required to be installed, would require substantial capital expenditures to construct and maintain.  There can be no assurance that recovery through rates would be authorized, particularly given the magnitude of any potential impact on customer rates, which at this time cannot be predicted with certainty.  Idaho Power also cannot predict the requirements that might be imposed during the relicensing process, the economic impact of those requirements, or whether a new multi-year license will ultimately be issued.  Imposition of onerous conditions in the relicensing process could result in Idaho Power incurring significant capital expenditures, increase operating costs, and reduce hydroelectric generation, which could reduce earnings and cash flows. IDACORP, Idaho Power, and their subsidiaries are subject to costs and other effects of legal and regulatory proceedings, settlements, investigations, and claims.  From time to time in the normal course of business, IDACORP, Idaho Power, and their subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory proceedings, lawsuits, and claims that could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, or other relief.  These matters are subject to a number of uncertainties, and as a result management is often unable to predict the outcome of a matter.  The final resolution of matters in which IDACORP, Idaho Power, or their subsidiaries are involved could require that they incur costs in a range of amounts that could have an adverse effect on their cash flows and results of operations.  Similarly, the terms of resolution could require the companies to change their business practices and procedures, which could also have an adverse effect on their cash flows, financial positions, or results of operations.IDACORP, IDACORP Energy, and Idaho Power are involved in a number of proceedings, including proceedings arising from the California energy crisis and the energy shortages, high prices, and blackouts in the western United States during 2000 and 2001, and a refund proceeding affecting sellers of wholesale power in the spot market in the Pacific Northwest.  Idaho Power may also be subject to costs and other effects of additional legal claims, actions, and complaints, including those related to the Jim Bridger, Valmy, and Boardman coal-fired plants, in which Idaho Power holds an ownership interest.  For instance, in September 2010 the Environmental Protection Agency issued a Notice of Violation to Portland General Electric Company, the majority owner of the Boardman plant, alleging violations of the New Source Performance Standards and operating permit requirements under the Clean Air Act as a result of prior modifications made to the plant.  Private parties have also brought tort actions against companies relating to their alleged contribution to climate change, including claims relating to the Jim Bridger and Boardman power plants.  If IDACORP, Idaho Power, or their subsidiaries are required to make payments in connection with any legal or regulatory proceeding, settlement, investigation, or claim, earnings and cash flows could be negatively affected. As a holding company, IDACORP does not have its own operating income and must rely on the upstream cash flows from its subsidiaries to pay dividends and make debt payments.  IDACORP is a holding company with no significant operations of its own, and its primary assets are shares or other ownership interests of its subsidiaries, primarily Idaho Power.  Consequently, IDACORP’s ability to pay dividends and to service its debt is dependent upon dividends and other payments received from its subsidiaries.  IDACORP’s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts to IDACORP, whether through dividends, loans, or other payments.  The ability of IDACORP’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to IDACORP depends on several factors, including each subsidiaries’ actual and projected earnings and cash flow, capital requirements and general financial condition, regulatory restrictions, covenants contained in credit facilities to which they are parties, and the prior rights of holders of their existing and future first mortgage bonds and other debt or equity securities.  Further, the amount and payment of dividends is at the discretion of the board of directors, which reviews the appropriateness of dividends in light of current and long-term financial position and results of operations, capital requirements, rating agency requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions, legislative and regulatory developments affecting the electric utility industry in general and Idaho Power in particular, competitive conditions, and any other factors the board of directors deems relevant.  Any of these factors may result in a reduction or cessation of dividends.  See Part II, Item 5 - ""Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities"" of this report for a description of restrictions on IDACORP's and Idaho Power's payment of dividends.  A downgrade in IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s credit ratings could affect the companies’ ability to access capital, increase their cost of borrowing, and require the companies to post collateral with transaction counterparties.  Access to capital markets is important to Idaho Power's ability to operate and to complete its capital projects, including its current and planned generation and transmission projects.  Credit rating agencies periodically review the corporate credit ratings and long-term ratings of IDACORP and Idaho Power, and these ratings impact access to, and the cost of, borrowing.  IDACORP and Idaho Power also have borrowing arrangements that rely on the ability of the banks to fund loans or support commercial paper, a principal source of short-term financing.  Downgrades of IDACORP’s or Idaho Power’s credit ratings, or those affecting 24relationship banks, could limit the companies’ ability to access capital, including the commercial paper markets, require the companies to pay a higher interest rate on their debt, and require the companies to post additional performance assurance collateral with transaction counterparties. Volatility in the financial markets, or denial of regulatory authority to issue debt or equity securities, may negatively affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s ability to access capital and/or increase their cost of borrowing, or result in losses on investments.  IDACORP and Idaho Power require liquidity to pay operating expenses and principal of, and interest on, debt and to finance capital expenditures not satisfied by cash flows from operations.  Financial markets have in recent years experienced extreme volatility and disruption, generally resulting in a decrease in the availability of liquidity and credit for borrowers.  In a volatile credit environment, one or more of the participating banks in IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s credit facilities may default on their obligations to make loans under, or withdraw from, the credit facilities, or IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s access to capital may otherwise be inhibited.  In addition, at times Idaho Power has a relatively large balance of short-term investments.  Volatility in the financial markets may result in a lack of liquidity for short-term investments and declines in value of some investments.  The occurrence of any of these events could affect Idaho Power's ability to execute its business plan and adversely affect IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s earnings, liquidity, and financial condition.  Further, Idaho Power is required to obtain regulatory approval in Idaho, Oregon, and Wyoming in order to borrow money or to issue securities and is therefore dependent on the public utility commissions of those states to issue favorable orders in a timely manner to permit them to finance their operations.  Notably, without additional approval from those commissions, the aggregate amount of short-term borrowings by Idaho Power at any one time outstanding may not exceed $450 million. National and regional economic conditions, in conjunction with increased electric rates, may cause increased late payments and uncollectible customer accounts, or reduce energy consumption, which would reduce earnings and cash flows.  Beginning in 2008, economic conditions in Idaho Power’s service area have been relatively weak.  Unemployment rates are high relative to historic unemployment levels and customer growth has been slow relative to prior years.  These factors may reduce the amount of energy Idaho Power’s customers consume; result in a loss of customers; increase the likelihood and prevalence of late payments and uncollectible accounts, and reduce the customer growth rate.  A resulting decrease in overall customer usage or collections may reduce revenues and earnings. Changes in tax laws and regulations, or differing interpretation or enforcement of applicable laws by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdictions, could have a material adverse impact on IDACORP’s or Idaho Power’s financial condition.  IDACORP and Idaho Power must make judgments and interpretations about the application of the law when determining the provision for taxes.  The companies’ tax obligations include income, real estate, public utility, municipal, sales and use, business and occupation, and employment-related taxes and ongoing issues related to these taxes.  These judgments may include reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that may be subject to challenge by taxing authorities.  For instance, recent income tax method changes had a significant impact on financial results in 2011.  The outcome of ongoing and future income tax proceedings could differ materially from the amounts IDACORP and Idaho Power record prior to conclusion of those proceedings, and the difference could reduce IDACORP’s and Idaho Power’s earnings and cash flows.  Further, in some instances the treatment from a ratemaking perspective of any tax benefits could be different than IDACORP or Idaho Power anticipate or request from applicable state regulatory commissions.  The Idaho Public Utilities Commission or Oregon Public Utility Commission could, for instance, determine that all or a portion of any benefits resulting from tax-related projects be shared with customers in the form of reduced rates or otherwise, which may reduce revenue, earnings, and cash flows. Employee workforce factors could increase costs and reduce earnings.  Idaho Power is subject to workforce factors, including loss or retirement of key personnel, availability of qualified personnel, an aging workforce, and impacts of efforts to organize workforce, including the possible unionization of one or more segments of the workforce.  Idaho Power’s operations require a skilled workforce to perform specialized, complex utility functions.  Idaho Power expects that a significant portion of its skilled workforce will be retiring, at a rate higher than Idaho Power's historical rate, within the next ten years, which places demand on Idaho Power to attract and retain skilled workers.  Without a skilled workforce, Idaho Power’s ability to provide quality service to its customers and meet regulatory requirements will be challenged and could affect earnings.  Also, the costs associated with attracting and retaining appropriately qualified employees to replace an aging and skilled workforce could reduce earnings and cash flows. Acts or threats of terrorism, cyber attacks, security breaches, and other acts of individuals or groups seeking to disrupt Idaho Power's operations, or the businesses of third parties, could result in reduced revenues and increased costs.  Idaho Power's generation and transmission facilities are potential targets for terrorist acts and threats, as well as cyber attacks and other disruptive activities of individuals or groups.  Some of Idaho Power's facilities are deemed critical infrastructure, in that incapacity or destruction of the facilities could have a debilitating impact on security, reliability or operability of the bulk 25electric power system, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.  The possibility that infrastructure facilities, such as generation facilities and electric transmission facilities, would be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror or cyber attack (whether originating internally or externally) may affect Idaho Power's operations by limiting the ability to generate, purchase, or transmit power and by delaying the development and construction of new generating and transmission facilities and capital improvements to existing facilities.  These events, and governmental actions in response, could result in a material decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to repair and insure Idaho Power's assets, and could further adversely affect Idaho Power's operations by contributing to disruption of supplies and markets for natural gas or coal used to fuel gas-fired or coal-fired power plants.  Because generation and transmission are part of an interconnected system, Idaho Power faces the risk of possible loss of business due to a disruption caused by the impact of an event on the interconnected system.  The events could also impair IDACORP's and Idaho Power's ability to raise capital by contributing to financial instability and lower economic activity.  Further, the implementation of security guidelines and measures has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in increased compliance costs.In the normal course of business, Idaho Power collects, processes, and retains sensitive and confidential customer and proprietary information, and operates systems that directly impact the availability of electric power and the transmission of electric power in the electric grid.  Idaho Power operates in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure.  Despite the security measures in place, Idaho Power's facilities and systems, and those of third-party service providers, could be vulnerable to security breaches, data leakage, or other similar events that could interrupt operations, resulting in a shutdown of service and exposing Idaho Power to liability.  Those breaches and events may result from acts of Idaho Power employees, contractors, or third parties.  If Idaho Power's technology systems were to fail or be breached and Idaho Power were unable to recover the systems and/or data in a timely manner, Idaho Power may be unable to fulfill critical business functions.  Also, confidential and proprietary business, employee, or customer information could be compromised, exposing Idaho Power to liability and causing business disruptions, which could have a material adverse effect on Idaho Power's operations and IDACORP's and Idaho Power's financial results.  The implementation of security guidelines and measures and maintenance of insurance, to the extent available, addressing such activities could increase costs and impact financial results.  In addition, these types of events could require significant management attention and resources, and could adversely affect IDACORP's and Idaho Power's reputation among customers and the public"

AND IDAHO POWER COMPANY ITEM 1.  BUSINESS OVERVIEW IDACORP, Inc. (IDACORP) is a holding company formed in 1998whose principal operating subsidiary is Idaho Power Company (Idaho Power). IDACORP is subject to the provisions of the Public Utility Holding Company Actof 2005, which provides certain access to books and records to the FederalEnergy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and state utility regulatory commissionsand imposes certain record retention and reporting requirements on IDACORP. Idaho Power was incorporated under the laws of the state ofIdaho in 1989 as successor to a Maine corporation organized in 1915.  IdahoPower is an electric utility engaged in the generation, transmission,distribution, sale, and purchase of electric energy and is regulated by theFERC and the state regulatory commissions of Idaho and Oregon.  Idaho Power isthe parent of Idaho Energy Resources Co. (IERCo), a joint venturer in BridgerCoal Company (BCC), which mines and supplies coal to the Jim Bridger generatingplant owned in part by Idaho Power. IDACORPs other subsidiaries include IDACORP FinancialServices, Inc. (IFS), an investor in affordable housing and other real estateinvestments;  Ida-West Energy Company (Ida-West), an operator of smallhydroelectric generation projects that satisfy the requirements of the PublicUtility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA); and IDACORP Energy (IE), amarketer of energy commodities that wound down operations in 2003. Idaho Power is IDACORPs only reportable business segment,contributing 98.5 percent of IDACORPs net income in 2010.  Segment data ispresented in Note 17  Segment Information to the consolidated financialstatements included in this report.  At December 31, 2010, IDACORP had 2,032full-time employees, 2,016 of whom were employed by Idaho Power, and 19part-time employees, all of whom were employed by Idaho Power. IDACORPs business strategy emphasizes Idaho Power asIDACORPs core business.  Idaho Power has a three-part strategy of responsibleplanning, responsible development and protection of resources, and responsibleenergy use to ensure adequate energy supplies.  Idaho Power continuouslyevaluates and refines its business strategy to ensure coordination among andintegration of all functional areas of the company.  Idaho Powers businessstrategy seeks to balance the interests of owners, customers, employees, andother stakeholders while maintaining the companys financial stability andflexibility.  The strategy includes:         RESPONSIBLE PLANNING:  Idaho Powers planning process is intendedto ensure adequate generation and transmission resources to meet anticipatedpopulation growth and increasing electricity demand.  This planning processintegrates Idaho Powers regulatory strategy and financial planning, includingthe consideration of regional economic development in the communities IdahoPower serves.        RESPONSIBLEDEVELOPMENT AND PROTECTION OF RESOURCES:  Idaho Powers business strategyincludes the development and protection of generation, transmission,distribution, and associated infrastructure, and stewardship of the naturalresources Idaho Power and the communities it serves depend upon.  Additionally,the strategy considers workforce planning and employee development andretention related to these strategic elements.  5   Tableofcontents   RESPONSIBLE ENERGY USE:  Idaho Power's business strategy includesenergy efficiency and demand response programs and preparation for potentialcarbon and renewable portfolio standards (RPS) legislation.  The strategy alsoincludes targeted reductions relating to carbon emission intensity and publicreporting of these reductions. IDACORP and Idaho Power make available free of charge ontheir websites their Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to these reports filed orfurnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after the reports are electronicallyfiled with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). IDACORP's website is www.idacorpinc.com and can also be accessed througha link to the IDACORP website on the Idaho Power website at www.idahopower.com. The contents of the above-referenced website addresses are not part of thisAnnual Report on Form 10-K.  Reports, proxy and information statements, andother information regarding IDACORP and Idaho Power may also be obtaineddirectly from the SECs website, www.sec.gov, or from the SECs PublicReference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549. IDACORPs and Idaho Powers principal executive offices arelocated at 1221 W. Idaho Street, Boise, Idaho 83702, and the telephone numberis (208) 388-2200. UTILITY OPERATIONS Idaho Powers service territory covers approximately 24,000square miles in southern Idaho and eastern Oregon, with an estimated populationof one million.  Idaho Power holds franchises, typically in the form ofright-of-way arrangements, in 71 cities in Idaho and nine cities in Oregon andholds certificates from the respective public utility regulatory authorities toserve all or a portion of 25 counties in Idaho and three counties in Oregon. As of December 31, 2010, Idaho Power supplied electric energy to approximately492,000 general business customers.  Idaho Powers principal commercial andindustrial customers are involved in food processing, electronics and generalmanufacturing, agriculture, forest products, beet sugar refining, and winterrecreation. Weather, customer demand, and economic conditions impactelectricity sales and, therefore, utility revenues are not generated, andassociated expenses are not incurred, evenly during the year.  Extremetemperatures increase sales to customers who use electricity for cooling andheating, and moderate temperatures decrease sales.  Increased precipitationlevels during the agricultural growing season reduce electricity sales tocustomers who use electricity to operate irrigation pumps.  Idaho Powersretail energy sales typically peak during the summer irrigation and coolingseason, with a lower peak in the winter that generally results from heatingdemand. Electric utilities have historically been recognized asnatural monopolies and have operated in a highly regulated environment in whichthey have an obligation to provide electric service to their customers inreturn for an exclusive franchise within their service territory with anopportunity to earn a regulated rate of return.  Idaho Power is under theretail jurisdiction (as to rates, service, accounting, and other generalmatters of utility operation) of the Idaho Public Utilities Commission (IPUC)and the Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC), and as a regulated electricutility Idaho Power is generally not subject to retail competition.  IdahoPower is also under the jurisdiction of the IPUC, the OPUC, and the PublicService Commission of Wyoming as to the issuance of debt and equity securities. Rates and Revenues Retail:Idaho Power periodically evaluates the need to seek changesto its retail electricity price structure to sufficiently cover its operatingcosts and provide a reasonable rate of return.  Idaho Power uses general ratecases, power cost adjustment (PCA) mechanisms, a fixed cost adjustment (FCA)mechanism, and subject-specific filings to recover its costs of providingservice and to earn a return on investment. Retail prices are determined through formal ratemakingproceedings that generally include testimony by participating parties, datarequests, public hearings, and the issuance of a final order.  Participants insuch proceedings, which are conducted under established procedural schedules,include Idaho Power, the IPUC or   6   Tableofcontents  OPUC, and intervenors.  The IPUC and OPUC arerequired to ensure that the prices and terms of service are fair,non-discriminatory, and provide the company an opportunity to earn a fairreturn on investment. In addition to general rate case filings, ratemakingproceedings can involve charges or credits related to specific costs, programs,or activities, as well as the recovery or refund of deferred amounts recordedpursuant to specific authorization from the IPUC or OPUC.  Such amounts aregenerally collected from, or refunded to, retail customers through the use ofsupplemental tariffs. For additional information, including information onsignificant rate cases and proceedings, see the Regulatory Matters section ofPart II, Item 7  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditionand Results of Operations (MD&A) and Note 3  Regulatory Matters to theconsolidated financial statements included in this report. Developments with Special Customer Electric ServiceAgreementsIdaho Power is authorized to enter into special electricservice arrangements with customers who have an aggregate power requirementthat exceeds 20 MW.  Notable recent developments with respect to two of thosearrangements are described below. Micron:  On February 12, 2010, the IPUC approved areplacement electric service agreement between Idaho Power and Micron Technology,Inc. (Micron) that provided operating and planning benefits to Idaho Powerwhile allowing Micron to reduce its contract demand to 60 MW.  The prioragreement provided for a contract demand of 85 MW. Hoku:  In March 2009, the IPUC approved a September2008 electric service agreement between Idaho Power and Hoku Materials, Inc.(Hoku), to provide electric service to Hokus polysilicon production facilitybeing constructed in Pocatello, Idaho.  The initial term of the agreement wasfour years beginning June 1, 2009, subsequently changed to December 1, 2009,with a maximum demand obligation during the initial term of 82 MW.  Hoku wasstill not taking significant service as of December 1, 2009, and Idaho Poweragreed to temporarily waive the minimum billed energy charge in the Hokuspecial contract, effective December 1, 2009.  The temporary waiver, which wasapproved by the IPUC, remains in effect until the month the contract loadfactor first exceeds 70 percent of the total contract demand, or March 31,2011, whichever comes first.  While the substantial delay in the starting datefor Hokus energy purchases under the electric service agreement reduces IdahoPowers expected revenues, the revenue reductions are largely offset bycorresponding reductions in Idaho Powers costs of providing service to Hoku. Wholesale:As a public utility under Part II of the Federal Power Act(FPA), Idaho Power has authority to charge market-based rates for wholesaleenergy sales under its FERC tariff and to provide transmission services underits Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT).  Idaho Powers OATT is revised eachyear based on financial and operational data Idaho Power files annually withthe FERC in its Form 1.  The Energy Policy Act of 2005 granted the FERCincreased statutory authority to implement mandatory transmission andreliability standards, as well as enhanced oversight of power and transmissionmarkets, including protection against market manipulation.  Such standards,which are applicable to Idaho Power, were developed by the North AmericanElectric Reliability Corporation and the Western Electricity CoordinatingCouncil (WECC), which has responsibility for compliance and enforcement ofthese standards. Idaho Power has one firm wholesale power salescontract, with Raft River Electric Cooperative, for up to 15 MW.  This contractexpires in September 2011.  Idaho Power has one wholesale reserve salescontract, with United Materials of Great Falls, Inc.  The agreement requiresIdaho Power to carry energy reserves in association with an energy salesagreement between Idaho Power and United Materials from the Horseshoe Bend WindFarm located in Montana.  The term of the agreement runs seasonally through May2013. Idaho Power participates in the wholesale energy market by buying power to helpmeet load demands and selling power that is in excess of load demands. Idaho Power's market activities are guided by a risk management policy andfrequently updated operating plans and are influenced by customer load, marketprices, generating costs, and availability of generating resources.  Someof Idaho Power's hydroelectric generation facilities are operated to optimizethe water that is available by choosing when to run hydroelectric generationunits and when to store water in reservoirs.  These decisions affect thetiming and volumes of market purchases and market sales.  Even inbelow-normal water years, there are opportunities  7   Tableofcontents  to vary water usageto maximize generation unit efficiency, capture marketplace economic benefits,and meet load demand.  Wholesale energy market prices and compliance factors,such as allowable river stage elevation changes and flood control requirements,influence these dispatch decisions. Energy Sales:The table below presents Idaho Powers revenues and energyuse by customer type for the last three years.  Approximately 95 percent ofIdaho Powers general business revenue comes from customers located in Idaho,with the remainder coming from customers located in Oregon.  Idaho Powersoperations are discussed further in Part II, Item 7 - MD&A  Results ofOperations - Utility Operations.  Years Ended

purchaseagreements to supply the energy needed to serve customers.  Idaho Powersannual hydroelectric generation varies depending on water conditions in theSnake River and market purchases and sales are used to balance supply anddemand throughout the year.  Idaho Powers generating plants and theircapacities are listed in Part I, Item 2 - Properties. Weather, customer growth, and economic conditions impactpower supply costs.  Drought conditions and customer growth cause a greaterreliance on more expensive purchased power to meet load requirements. Conversely, favorable hydroelectric generation conditions increase productionat Idaho Powers hydroelectric generating facilities and reduce the need forpurchased power.  Economic conditions can affect the market price of naturalgas and coal, which may impact fuel expense and market prices for purchasedpower. Idaho Powers system is dual peaking, with the larger peakdemand occurring in the summer.  The all-time system peak demand is 3,214 MW,set on June 30, 2008, and the all-time winter peak demand is 2,527 MW, set onDecember 10, 2009.  During these and other similarly heavy load periods IdahoPowers system is fully committed to serve load and meet required operatingreserves. 8   Tableofcontents   The following table presents IdahoPowers total power supply for the last three years:  MWhPercent of Total

tributaries. Together, these hydroelectric facilities provide a total nameplate capacity of1,709 MW and annual generation equal to approximately 8.6 million megawatt-hours(MWh) under median water conditions. The availability of hydroelectricpower depends on the amount of snow pack in the mountains upstream of IdahoPowers hydroelectric facilities, reservoir storage, springtime snow packrun-off, river base flows, spring flows, rainfall, amount and timing of waterleases, and other weather and stream flow management considerations.  Duringlow water years, when stream flows into Idaho Powers hydroelectric projectsare reduced, Idaho Powers hydroelectric generation is reduced. The manner in which Idaho Power hashistorically optimized operation of its hydroelectric facilities may change inthe future as the company is faced with integrating an increasing amount ofintermittent wind generation.  As additional intermittent wind generationresources are developed in the region and contracted to Idaho Power, theoperational impacts will likely increase.  For related information onintermittent wind generation see Purchased Power Agreements below. Stream flow conditions were belowaverage in 2010, resulting in a decrease of 0.8 million MWh generated fromIdaho Powers hydroelectric facilities compared to 2009.  The observed streamflow data released in August 2010 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers indicatedthat Brownlee Reservoir inflow for April through July 2010 was 4.6 millionacre-feet (maf), or 73 percent of the National Weather Service Northwest RiverForecast Center (NWRFC) average, compared to 5.6 maf, or 89 percent, of theNWRFC average in 2009. Power generation at the Idaho Power hydroelectric powerplants on the Snake River also depends on the state water rights held by IdahoPower and the long-term sustainability of the Snake River, tributary springflows, and the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer that is connected to the SnakeRiver.  Idaho Power continues to participate in water management issues inIdaho that may affect those water rights and resources with the goal topreserve, to the fullest extent possible, the long-term availability of waterfor use at Idaho Powers hydroelectric projects on the Snake River.  For moreinformation on water management issues see Part II, Item 7  MD&A  LegalMatters  Snake River Basin Water Rights. Idaho Power is subject to the provisions of the FPA as apublic utility and as a licensee and is subject to regulation by the FERC. As a licensee under Part I of the FPA, Idaho Power and its licensedhydroelectric projects are subject to conditions described in the FPA andrelated FERC regulations.  These conditions and regulations include provisionsrelating to condemnation of a project upon payment of just compensation,amortization of project investment from excess project earnings, possibletakeover of a project after expiration of its license upon payment of netinvestment, severance damages, and other matters. 9   Tableofcontents  Idaho Power obtains licenses for its hydroelectric projectsfrom the FERC, similar to other utilities that operate nonfederal hydroelectricprojects on qualified waterways.  The licensing process includes an extensivepublic review process and involves numerous natural resource and environmentalissues.  The licenses last 30 to 50 years depending on the size, complexity,and cost of the project.  Idaho Power is actively pursuing the relicensing ofthe Hells Canyon Complex and Swan Falls projects.  For further information onrelicensing activities see Part II, Item 7  MD&A  Relicensing ofHydroelectric Projects. The state of Oregon has a Hydroelectric Act providing forlicensing of hydroelectric projects in that state.  Idaho Powers Brownlee,Oxbow, and Hells Canyon facilities are subject to the Oregon HydroelectricAct.  Idaho Power has obtained Oregon licenses for these facilities. Coal and Natural Gas-Fired Generation:Idaho Power co-owns three coal-fired power plants and ownstwo natural gas-fired combustion turbine power plants.  The coal-fired plantsare Jim Bridger located in Wyoming, Boardman located in Oregon, and Valmylocated in Nevada.  The natural gas-fired plants, Danskin and Bennett Mountain,are located in Idaho.  The Langley Gulch natural gas-fired combined cycle powerplant located in Idaho is currently under construction and is contracted toachieve commercial operation by November 1, 2012.  Based on contract incentivesand the current project status, Idaho Power estimates that the plant will be inservice by June 2012. Fuel supply-coalIdaho Power, through its subsidiary IERCo, owns a one-thirdinterest in BCC, which owns the Jim Bridger mine that supplies coal to the JimBridger generating plant (one-third owned by Idaho Power).  The mine, locatednear the Jim Bridger plant, operates under a long-term sales agreement thatprovides for delivery of coal over a 51-year period ending in 2024 fromsurface, high-wall, and underground sources.  Idaho Power believes that the JimBridger mine has sufficient reserves to provide coal deliveries for the term ofthe sales agreement.  Idaho Power also has a coal supply contract providing forannual deliveries of coal through 2014 from the Black Butte Coal CompanysBlack Butte and Leucite Hills mines located near the Jim Bridger plant.  Thiscontract supplements the Bridger Coal deliveries and provides another coalsupply to operate the Jim Bridger plant.  The Jim Bridger plants rail load-infacility and unit coal train provide the opportunity to access other fuelsupplies for tonnage requirements above established contract minimums. NV Energy, Inc., as the operator of the Valmy generatingplant, has an agreement with Arch Coal Sales Company, Inc. to supply coal tothe plant through 2011; however, due to force majeure provisions of thecontract, approximately 131,000 tons (Idaho Power portion) will be delivered tothe Valmy plant in 2012 instead of 2011.  As a 50 percent owner of the plant,Idaho Power is obligated to purchase one-half of the coal, ranging from 515,000tons to 762,500 tons annually.  NV Energy, Inc. also has a coal supply contractwith Black Butte Coal Companys Black Butte Mine for deliveries through 2015. Idaho Power is obligated to purchase one-half of the coal purchased under thisagreement ranging from as low as 44,000 to as high as 500,000 tons annually. The Boardman generating plant receives coal from the PowderRiver Basin through annual contracts.  Portland General Electric Company, asthe operator of the Boardman plant, has two agreements with Alpha NaturalResources, Inc., to supply all of the Boardman plants coal requirements in2011.  As a ten percent owner of the plant, Idaho Power is obligated topurchase ten percent of the coal purchased under these agreements, which is243,600 tons in 2011 (including approximately 60,300 tons provided by forcemajeure contract provisions from 2009).  A request for proposal (RFP) for the2012 coal supply is planned in 2011. Fuel supply-natural gasIdaho Power owns and operates the Danskin and BennettMountain combustion turbines.  Natural gas is purchased based on systemrequirements.  The natural gas is supplied through Northwest Pipeline GPs(Northwest) pipeline under a 24,523 million British thermal units (MMBtu) perday long-term gas transportation service agreement.  The agreement runs into2022, with extensions at Idaho Powers discretion.  In addition to thelong-term gas transportation service agreement, Idaho Power has entered into along-term storage service agreement with Northwest for 131,453 MMBtu of totalstorage capacity at the Jackson Prairie Storage Project.  As the project isdeveloped, storage capacity will be phased into service and allocated to IdahoPower on a monthly basis.  Idaho Power's current storage allotment isapproximately 74 percent of its total, and its full allotment is expected to bereached by March 2012.  The firm storage  10   Tableofcontents contract expires in 2043.  Natural gaswill be purchased and stored with the intent of fulfilling needs as identifiedfor summer peaks or to meet system requirements. Procurement of gas for the Langley Gulch combined-cyclenatural gas-fired power plant will be managed to meet system requirements andfueling strategies.  Natural gas for Langley Gulch will be supplied throughmultiple Northwest long-term gas transportation service agreements totaling31,061 MMBtu per day with a range of start dates beginning March 2011 and arange of end dates through May 2042.  Idaho Power has sole discretion regardingextensions to the multiple long-term service agreements. Purchased Power Agreements:Idaho Power purchases power in the market, based oneconomics, operating reserve margins, risk limits, and unit availability, andfrom PURPA projects as mandated.  Idaho Power seeks to manage its loadsefficiently by utilizing its generation resources and long-term purchase powercontracts in conjunction with buying and selling opportunities in the market. Idaho Power has the following firm wholesale purchased powercontracts and energy exchange agreements:PPL Energy Plus, LLC - for 83 MW per hour during heavy loadhours, to address increased demand during June, July and August.  The contractterm is through August 2011;Raft River Energy I, LLC - for 13 MW (nameplate generation) fromits Raft River Geothermal Power Plant Unit #1 located in southern Idaho.  Thecontract term is through April    2033;Telocaset Wind Power Partners, LLC - for 101 MW (nameplategeneration) from its Elkhorn Valley wind project located in eastern Oregon. The contract term is through 2027;USG Oregon LLC - for 22 MW (estimated average annual output) fromthe to-be-constructed Neal Hot Springs #1 geothermal power plant located nearVale, Oregon.  The contract term is 25 years with an option to extend. Commercial operation is expected in late 2012;Clatskanie Peoples Utility - for the exchange of up to 18 MW ofenergy from the Arrowrock Project in southern Idaho for energy from IdahoPowers system or power purchased at the Mid-Columbia trading hub.  The initialterm of the agreement is January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2015.  IdahoPower has the right to renew the agreement for two additional five-year terms;andNV Energy, Inc. - for the exchange of up to 45 MW of energyhourly.  The agreement expires March 31, 2012. Pursuant to the requirements of Section 210 of PURPA, thestate regulatory commissions have each issued orders and rules regulating IdahoPowers purchase of power from cogeneration and small power production (CSPP)facilities.  A key component of the PURPA contracts is the energy pricecontained within the agreements.  The PURPA regulations specify that a utilitymust pay energy prices based on the utilitys avoided costs.  The PublishedAvoided Cost is a price established by the IPUC and OPUC to estimate IdahoPowers cost of developing additional generation resources.  The IPUC and OPUChave established specific rules and regulations to calculate the PublishedAvoided Cost that Idaho Power is required to include in PURPA contracts. Idaho Power has contracts for the purchase of energy from anumber of private developers.  For these contracts:Idaho Power is required to purchase all of the output from thefacilities located inside its service territory, subject to some exceptionssuch as adverse impacts on system reliability;Idaho Power is required to purchase the output of projectslocated outside its service territory if it has the ability to receive power atthe facilitys requested point of delivery on the Idaho Power system;the IPUC jurisdictional portion of the costs associated with CSPPcontracts is fully recovered through base rates and the PCA; the OPUCjurisdictional portion is recovered through general rate case filings and theOregon PCA mechanism;for IPUC jurisdictional contracts, projects that generate up toten average MW of energy monthly are eligible for IPUC Published Avoided Costsfor up to a 20-year contract term.  The IPUC has granted a temporary reductionin the upper eligibility limit to 100 kilowatts (kW) for wind and solarprojects, as discussed below;for OPUCjurisdictional contracts, projects with a nameplate rating of up to ten MW ofcapacity are eligible for OPUC Published Avoided Costs for up to a 20-yearcontract term; and  11   Tableofcontents  if a PURPA project does not qualify for Published Avoided Costs,Idaho Power is required to negotiate the terms, prices, and conditions with thedeveloper.  These negotiations reflect the characteristics of the individualprojects (i.e., operational flexibility, location, and size) and the benefitsto the Idaho Power system and must be consistent with other similar energyalternatives.Published Avoided Cost rates remain relatively high,providing a favorable climate for PURPA project development, which may resultin Idaho Power acquiring energy at above wholesale market prices when a surplusalready exists and may also require additional integration costs, thusincreasing costs to its customers.  In response to a November 5, 2010application filed by Idaho Power and two other electric utilities with Idahoservice territories, on February 7, 2011, the IPUC issued an order temporarilyreducing the eligibility cap, effective retroactively to December 14, 2010, to100 kW for wind and solar PURPA projects only, while the IPUC furtherinvestigates the implications of large projects disaggregating into smallerprojects to qualify for higher Published Avoided Cost rates, tax incentives,and other benefits. As of December 31, 2010, Idaho Power had the followingsigned CSPP-related agreements originally ranging from one to 35 years.  Themajority of the new facilities will be wind resources which will generate on anintermittent basis.  # ofNameplateStatusContractsCapacity (MW)On-line at the end of 201091491  Projected to come on-line by year-end 201435697  Total1261,188   During 2010, Idaho Power purchased 910,429 MWh of power fromCSPP facilities at a cost of $55 million, resulting in a blended price of$60.38 per MWh. Transmission Services Electric transmission systems deliver energy from electricgeneration facilities to distribution systems for final delivery to customers. Transmission systems are designed to move electricity over long distancesbecause generation facilities can be located anywhere from a few miles tohundreds of miles from customers.  Idaho Powers generating facilities areinterconnected through its integrated transmission system and are operated on acoordinated basis to achieve maximum load-carrying capability and reliability. Idaho Powers transmission system is directly interconnected with thetransmission systems of the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), AvistaCorporation, PacifiCorp, NorthWestern Energy, and NV Energy, Inc.  Theseinterconnections, coupled with transmission line capacity made available underagreements with some of the above entities, permit the interchange, purchase,and sale of power among all major electric systems in the west interconnectingwith the winter-peaking northern and summer-peaking southern regions of thewestern power system.  Idaho Power provides wholesale transmission service andprovides firm and non-firm wheeling services for eligible transmissioncustomers.  Idaho Power is a member of the WECC, the Western Systems Power Pool,the Northwest Power Pool, the Northern Tier Transmission Group, and the NorthAmerican Energy Standards Board.  These groups have been formed to moreefficiently coordinate transmission reliability and planning throughout thewestern grid. Resource Planning and Renewable Energy Projects Idaho Power filed its 2009 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP)with the IPUC and OPUC in December 2009.  The IRP forecasts Idaho Powers loadand resource situation for the next 20 years, analyzes potential supply-sideand demand-side options, and identifies near-term and long-term actions.  The2009 IRP was accepted by the IPUC in August 2010 and acknowledged by the OPUCin October 2010.  The four primary goals of the IRP are to: identify sufficient resources to reliably serve the growingdemand for energy within Idaho Powers service area throughout the 20-yearplanning period;ensure the selected resource portfolio balances cost, risk, andenvironmental concerns; 12   Tableofcontents   give equal and balanced treatment to both supply-side resourcesand demand-side measures; andinvolve the public in the planning process in a meaningful way. Idaho Power updates the IRP every two years and work on the2011 IRP began in the summer of 2010.  The updated plan is expected to becompleted and filed in June 2011.  During the time between resource planfilings, the public and regulatory oversight of the activities identified inthe 2009 IRP allows for discussion and adjustment of the IRP as warranted. Idaho Power makes periodic adjustments and corrections to the resource plan toreflect changes in technology, economic conditions, anticipated resourcedevelopment, and regulatory requirements. The 2009 IRP identified the 300 MW Langley Gulch projectcurrently under construction and a 50 MW expansion of the Shoshone Fallshydroelectric facility that is currently being evaluated for economicviability.  Idaho Power is also planning the Boardman to Hemingway and theGateway West transmission lines and has constructed the Hemingway substation,all of which are intended to improve reliability, relieve congestion, andprovide system flexibility.  Refer to Part II, Item 7  MD&A  Liquidityand Capital Resources  Capital Requirements  Major Projects for additionalinformation about Idaho Powers significant infrastructure development projectsand plan.  The 2009 IRP also included discussion related to the followingresources: Geothermal RFPs:Although the results of previously conducted geothermal RFPprocesses have been disappointing, Idaho Power continues to work with projectdevelopers capable of delivering energy to the companys service area.  The2009 IRP included two 20-MW increments of geothermal energy in the preferredportfolio; one in 2012 and one in 2016.  The 20-MW increment in 2012 was addressedby a long-term power purchase agreement for the output from the Neal HotSprings Geothermal Project located in eastern Oregon.  The need for theadditional 2016 increment of geothermal energy is being assessed in the 2011IRP. Wind RFP:In May 2009, Idaho Power issued an RFP seeking to purchaseup to 150 MW of wind generation by 2012.  The RFP generated considerableinterest from wind developers, and throughout the first half of 2010, IdahoPower negotiated with the front-runner.  During this time, other projectdevelopers began expressing an interest in developing wind projects under PURPAand it became evident the additional wind generation under PURPA would exceedthe 150 MW identified in the RFP.  Due to the acquisition of this additionalPURPA wind generation and due to stalled contract negotiations in the RFPprocess, Idaho Power did not award a contract under the RFP process and concludedthe RFP process in August 2010. Combined Heat and Power (CHP) RFP:CHP resources were not included in the 2009 IRP preferredportfolio because of the uncertainty in being able to successfully develop aCHP project.  However, Idaho Power continues to work with large customers andother parties to explore CHP development opportunities. In 2009, Idaho Power signed an agreement to jointlyinvestigate a CHP project with the Idaho Office of Energy Resources (IOER) andThe Amalgamated Sugar Company (TASCO), one of Idaho Powers large industrialcustomers.  The agreement established the framework for a high-level feasibilitystudy to investigate installing a CHP project at TASCOs Nampa, Idaho facilitythat could be as large as 100 MW.  The IOER and Idaho Power jointly funded thestudy.  The high-level feasibility study confirmed initial estimates of theprojects potential benefits, and in September 2010, Idaho Power, IOER, andTASCO entered into a second agreement to complete a more detailed feasibilitystudy to refine performance and financial modeling of the proposed project.  AnRFP was issued and a consulting firm was selected to perform the more detailedfeasibility study.  The study is expected to be completed by the second quarterof 2011. Energy Efficiency and Demand-Side Management Programs:In 2010, Idaho Powers energy efficiency programs reducedenergy usage by approximately 170,000 MWh, and the demand response programsresulted in a summer peak demand reduction of about 300 MW through combinedprogram performance. 13   Tableofcontents   In 2010, Idaho Power spent approximately $45.6 million onenergy efficiency and targeted demand reduction response programs. Approximately $44.2 million of funding for these programs is funded by Idahoand Oregon energy efficiency tariff riders while the balance of the fundingcomes from Idaho Power base rates. Idaho Power has 15 energy efficiency and demand responseprograms in place, targeting savings across the entire year and summer systemdemand reduction.  These programs are offered to all customer segments andemphasize the wise use of energy, especially during periods of high demand.  Thisenergy and demand reduction can minimize or delay the need for newinfrastructure.  Idaho Powers programs include:  financial incentives for irrigation customers for eitherimproving the energy efficiency of an irrigation system or installing new energyefficient systems;energy efficiency for new and existing homes, including efficientappliances and HVAC equipment, energy efficient building techniques, insulationimprovement, air duct sealing, and energy efficient lighting; incentives to industrial and commercial customers for usingenergy efficient equipment, and using energy efficiency techniques andoperational and management processes; anddemand response programs to reduce peak summer demand through thevoluntary interruption of central air conditioners for residential customers,interruption of irrigation pumps, and reduction of commercial and industrialdemand through a third-party demand response aggregator. Approximately $3 million of Idaho Powers 2010 energyefficiency spending was related to research and analysis, education, technologyevaluation, and market transformation.  Most of this activity was done inconjunction with the Northwest Energy Efficiency Alliance (NEEA). Environmental Regulation Idaho Power is subject to a broad range of federal, state,regional, and local laws and regulations designed to protect, restore, andenhance the quality of the environment including air, water, and solid waste. Current and pending legislation relates to, among other items, climate change, greenhousegas emissions and air quality, renewable energy standards (RES), mercury andother emissions, hazardous wastes, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Environmental laws and regulations may, among other things, increase the costof operating power generation plants and constructing new facilities, requirethat Idaho Power install additional pollution control devices at existinggenerating plants, or require that Idaho Power discontinue operating certainpower generation plants.  Environmental regulation continues to impact IdahoPowers operations due to the cost of installation and operation of equipmentand facilities required for compliance with such regulations, and themodification of system operations to accommodate such regulations.  In additionto generally applicable regulations, the FERC licenses issued for Idaho Powershydroelectric generating plants have environmental requirements such asaeration of turbine water to meet dissolved gas and temperature standards inthe tail waters downstream from the plants.  Idaho Power monitors these issuesand reports the results to the appropriate regulatory agencies.  Further, IdahoPower co-owns three coal-fired power plants and owns two natural gas combustionturbine power plants that are subject to a broad range of environmentalrequirements, including air quality regulation.  For a more detailed discussionof these and other environmental issues, refer to Part II, Item 7  MD&A Environmental Issues.  14   Tableofcontents   Idaho Powers environmental compliance costs will continueto be significant for the foreseeable future, especially with potentialadditional regulation under discussion at the state and federal level.  IdahoPower estimates its environmental expenditures, based upon presentenvironmental laws and regulations, will be as follows for the periodsindicated, excluding allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) (inmillions of dollars): Environmental  expenditures20112012 - 2013Studies  and measures at hydroelectric facilities$6$57Investments  in equipment and facilities at thermal plants 10 52Total  capital expenditures$16$109  Operating  costs

impending EPArulemakings and proceedings addressing, among other things, ozone and fineparticulate matter pollution, emissions, and disposal of coal combustion residualscould result in substantially increased operating and compliance costs. IFS IFS invests primarily in affordable housing developments,which provide a return principally by reducing federal and state income taxesthrough tax credits and accelerated tax depreciation benefits.  IFS generatedtax credits of $7 million, $8 million, and $11 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008,respectively.  IFSs portfolio also includes historic rehabilitation projectssuch as the Empire Building in Boise, Idaho.  IFS had $7 million, $14 million,and $8 million of new investments during 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively,and will continue to review future legislation for new opportunities forinvestment that will be commensurate with the ongoing needs of IDACORP. IFS has focused on a diversified approach to its investmentstrategy in order to limit both geographic and operational risk.  Over 90percent of IFSs investments have been made through syndicated funds.  AtDecember 31, 2010, the gross amount of IFSs portfolio equaled $204 million intax credit investments.  These investments cover 49 states, Puerto Rico, andthe U.S. Virgin Islands.  The underlying investments include over 700individual properties, of which all but six are administered through syndicatedfunds. IDA-WEST Ida-West operates and has a 50 percent interest in ninehydroelectric plants with a total generating capacity of 45 MW.  Four of theprojects are located in Idaho and five are in northern California.  All nineprojects are qualifying facilities under PURPA.  Idaho Power purchased all ofthe power generated by Ida-Wests four Idaho hydroelectric projects at a costof $8 million, $9 million, and $8 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008,respectively.15   Tableofcontents  EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THEREGISTRANTS The names, ages, and positionsof the

condition, or results of operations of IDACORP, Inc. andIdaho Power Company and could cause actual results or outcomes to differmaterially from those discussed in any forward-looking statements. If the Idaho Public Utilities Commission, the OregonPublic Utility Commission, or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission grantless rate recovery in regulatory proceedings than Idaho Power Company needs tocover existing and future increased costs of providing services, earnings andcash flows may be reduced.  The prices that the Idaho PublicUtilities Commission and Oregon Public Utility Commission authorize Idaho PowerCompany to charge for its retail services, and the tariff rate that the FederalEnergy Regulatory Commission permits Idaho Power Company to charge fortransmission, are the most significant factors influencing IDACORP, Inc.s andIdaho Power Companys financial position, results of operations, andliquidity.  The Idaho Public Utilities Commission and Oregon Public UtilityCommission have the authority to disallow recovery of any costs that theyconsider unreasonable or imprudently incurred, and the formula rates allowed bythe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission may be insufficient for recovery ofcosts incurred.  While the Idaho Public Utilities Commission and Oregon PublicUtility Commission have established through the ratemaking process anauthorized rate of return for Idaho Power Company, the regulatory process doesnot provide assurance that Idaho Power Company will be able to achieve theearnings level authorized.  Further, while the Idaho Public UtilitiesCommission and Oregon Public Utility Commission are required to establish ratesthat are fair, just, and reasonable, they have significant discretion inapplying this standard.  The ratemaking process typically involves multipleparties, including governmental bodies, consumer advocacy groups, and variousconsumers of energy, each party has differing concerns but have the commonobjective of limiting rate increases or even reducing rates.  Idaho PowerCompany cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of any ratemaking proceedings,including the extent to which certain costssuch as significant capitalprojectswill be recovered or what rates of return will be allowed. In January 2010, the Idaho Public Utilities Commissionapproved a settlement agreement that imposed a general rate moratorium ineffect in the Idaho jurisdiction until January 1, 2012.  While the moratoriumdoes not apply to other specified revenue requirement proceedings, such as thepower cost adjustment, the fixed cost adjustment, pension funding, advancedmetering infrastructure, energy efficiency rider, and government imposed fees,Idaho Power Company attempts to manage its costs consistent with themoratorium.  However, if Idaho Power Company is unable to do so, or if suchcost management results in increased operational risk, the moratorium couldadversely affect Idaho Power Companys operations or results of operations. Idaho Power Company has power cost adjustment mechanismsthat provide for periodic adjustments to the rates charged to its Idaho andOregon retail customers.  The power cost adjustment tracks Idaho PowerCompanys actual net power supply costs (primarily fuel and purchased powerless off-system sales) and compares these amounts to net power supply costscurrently being recovered in retail rates.  A majority, but not all, of thevariance between these two amounts is deferred for future recovery from orrefund to customers.  Accordingly, the power cost adjustment mechanism only partiallyoffsets the potentially adverse financial impacts of forced generating plantoutages, severe weather, reduced hydroelectric generating availability, andvolatile wholesale energy prices.  Because of the power cost adjustmentmechanism, the primary financial impact of power supply cost variations is onthe timing of cash flows.  When costs rise above the level recovered in retailrates it adversely affects Idaho Power Companys operating cash flow andliquidity until those costs are recovered from customers. 18   Tableofcontents Reduced hydroelectricgeneration can reduce revenues and increase costs, and reduce earnings and cashflows.  Idaho Power Company has a predominately hydroelectricgenerating base.  Because of Idaho Power Companys heavy reliance onhydroelectric generation, the availability of water can significantly affectits operations.  When hydroelectric generation is reduced, Idaho Power Companymust increase its use of generally more expensive thermal generating resourcesand purchased power and opportunities for off-system sales are reduced, whichreduces revenues.  In addition, while Idaho Power Company can expect torecover, as a result of its power cost adjustment mechanisms, the majority ofits net power supply costs above the level included in its rates, recovery ofthe excess amounts does not occur until the subsequent power cost adjustmentyear. Continuing declines in stream flows andover-appropriation of water in Idaho may reduce hydroelectric generation andrevenues and increase costs.  The combination of declining SnakeRiver base flows, over-appropriation of water, and drought conditions have ledto disputes among surface water and ground water irrigators, and the State ofIdaho.  Recharging the Eastern Snake Plain aquifer, which contributes to SnakeRiver flows, by diverting surface water to porous locations and permitting itto sink into the aquifer, is one proposed solution to the dispute.  Diversionsfrom the Snake River for aquifer recharge may further reduce Snake River flowsavailable for hydroelectric generation and reduce Idaho Power Companysrevenues and increase costs.  Idaho Power Companys January 2010 settlementagreement with the State of Idaho resolves litigation regarding certain IdahoPower Company water rights on the Snake River and provides for ongoing SnakeRiver water issues to be addressed in a comprehensive aquifer management planprocess.  However, there is no assurance that this process will lead toincreased Snake River stream flows for Idaho Power Companys hydroelectricprojects.  Idaho Power Company also has initiated legal action against the U.S.Bureau of Reclamation over the interpretation and effect of a 1923 contractwith the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation on the operation of the American FallsReservoir and the release of water from that reservoir to be used at IdahoPower Companys downstream hydroelectric projects.  The comprehensive aquifermanagement plan process and the resolution of the litigation may affect SnakeRiver flows available for hydroelectric generation and thereby reduce IdahoPower Companys revenues and increase costs. Idaho Power Companys reliance on coal and natural gasto fuel its power generation facilities exposes it to risk of increased costsand reduced earnings.  In addition to hydroelectric generation,Idaho Power Company relies on coal and natural gas to fuel its generationfacilities.  Increases in market prices for coal and natural gas can result inreduced earnings.  Increases in demand for natural gas may result in market priceincreases, short-term price volatility, and supply availability issues. Operation of the Langley Gulch power plant that Idaho Power Company iscurrently constructing will increase Idaho Power Companys demand for naturalgas, and thus its exposure to volatility in natural gas prices.  In addition,delivery of coal and natural gas depends upon gas pipelines, rail lines, railcars, and roadways.  Any disruption in Idaho Power Companys fuel supply mayrequire the company to find alternative fuel sources at higher costs, toproduce power from higher cost generation facilities, or to purchase power fromother sources at higher costs, which may adversely impact earnings. Idaho Power Companys power generating facilities aresubject to numerous operational risks unique to it and its industry. Operating risks associated with hydroelectric, natural gas, coal, and othergeneration facilities include equipment failures, volatility in fuel andtransportation pricing, interruptions in fuel supplies, regulatory complianceobligations and costs, labor disputes, workforce safety matters, andcatastrophic events at the facilities.  These operational risks may result inplant outages, as well as increased operation and maintenance expenses, powergeneration costs, and power purchase costs. Load growth in Idaho Power Companys service territoryexposes it to greater market and operational risk and could increase costs andreduce earnings and cash flows.  While Idaho Power Companys customergrowth rate has slowed in recent years, increases in both the number ofcustomers and the demand for energy have resulted and may continue to result inincreased reliance on purchased power to meet that demand.  While Idaho PowerCompany can expect to recover the majority of the net power supply costs abovethe amounts included in its rates, recovery of the excess amounts does notoccur until the subsequent power cost adjustment year, and the remaining amountis absorbed by Idaho Power Company, which could increase costs and reduce earningsand cash flows.  Load growth can result in the need for additional investmentsin Idaho Power Companys infrastructure to serve the new load.  For instance,to meet customer demand Idaho Power Company is currently constructing itsLangley Gulch natural gas-fired generating plant, and has in development anumber of transmission projects.  If Idaho Power Company was unable to securetimely rate relief from the Idaho Public Utilities Commission, the OregonPublic Utility Commission, or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission torecover the costs of these additional investments, the resulting disconnectbetween the time expenditures are made and costs are recovered would have anegative effect on earnings and cash flows.  Load growth can create planning andoperating difficulties for Idaho Power Company that can negatively impact itsability to reliably serve customers. Weather andclimate change could affect customer demand and hydroelectric generation anddisrupt transmission and distribution systems, reducing earnings and cash flows. Warmer than normal winters, cooler than normal summers, and increased rainfallduring the irrigation seasons will reduce retail revenues from power sales andmay impact the amount and timing of hydroelectric generation.  Extremeweather 19 Tableofcontents  events can disrupt transmission and distribution systems andcause service interruptions and extended outages, increase supply chain costs,and potentially interrupt use of generation resources and limit the ability tomeet customer demand.  Disruption in transmission and distribution systemsincreases operations and maintenance expenses and reduces earnings and cashflows. In addition, long-term climate change could affect IdahoPower Companys business in a variety of ways, including:   changes in temperature and precipitation could affect customerdemand;  extreme weather events could increase service interruptions, outages,and maintenance costs;  changes in the amount and timing of snowpack and stream flowscould adversely affect hydroelectric generation;  legislative and/or regulatory developments related to climatechange could affect plans and operations, including placing restrictions on theconstruction of new generation resources and the expansion of existingresources, result in closure of generation resources or installation of costlypollution control equipment, or require changes to the operation of generationresources in general; and  consumer preference for, and resource planning decisionsrequiring, renewable or low greenhouse gas-emitting sources of energy couldimpact demand from existing sources and require significant investment in newgeneration and transmission resources. Any of these effects of climate change could decreaserevenues, increase operating costs, and reduce IDACORP, Inc.s and Idaho PowerCompanys earnings and cash flows. Idaho Power Companys risk management policy andprograms relating to hedging power and gas exposures and counterpartycreditworthiness may not always perform as intended, and as a result IdahoPower Company may suffer economic losses.  Idaho Power Companyis exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe it money will default ontheir obligations.  A similar risk of non-performance by third parties ariseswhere those parties are obligated to purchase energy from, or sell energy to,Idaho Power Company, or are parties to commodity price risk managementarrangements.  Idaho Power Company actively manages the market risk inherent inits energy related activities and counterparty credit positions.  Idaho PowerCompany has procedures that monitor compliance with its risk managementpolicies and programs, including verification of transactions, regularportfolio reporting of various risk management metrics, and daily counterpartycredit risk analysis.  However, actual hydroelectric and thermal generation,transmission availability, and market prices may be significantly differentthan those originally planned for when Idaho Power Company enters into itshedging transactions positions.  The high volatility of these items createsuncertainty in the appropriate amount of hedging activity to pursue.  Forecastsof future loads and available resources to meet those loads are inherentlyuncertain and may cause Idaho Power Company to over- or under-hedge actualresource needs, exposing the company to market risk on the over- orunder-hedged position.  Changes in market prices are also unpredictable and canat times result in Idaho Power Companys hedged positions performing lessfavorably than unhedged positions.  In addition, Idaho Power Companyscounterparty credit policies may not prevent counterparties from failing toperform, forcing the company to replace forward contracts with transactions inthe open market.  As a result, risk management decisions may have significantimpacts if actual events result in greater losses or costs in delivering energyto customers and could negatively affect IDACORP, Inc.s and Idaho PowerCompanys financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Increased capital expenditures for power generationand delivery infrastructure development and replacement can significantlyaffect liquidity.  Idaho Power Companys business is capitalintensive and requires significant investments in energy generation and inother infrastructure projects.  Increases in both the number of customers andthe demand for energy require expansion and reinforcement of transmission anddistribution systems, generating facilities, and other infrastructure.  Thecost of maintaining existing, aging equipment and infrastructure and developingnew infrastructure is substantial, and involves risks relating to, among otherthings, cost overruns, unscheduled outages, price increases in commodities(such as steel and copper) and other materials necessary for developinginfrastructure, and denial of regulatory recovery.  If Idaho Power Company doesnot receive timely regulatory recovery of costs associated with those expansionand reinforcement activities or other capital projects, Idaho Power Companywill have to rely more heavily on external financing for its future utilityconstruction expenditures.  These large planned expenditures may weaken theconsolidated financial profile of IDACORP, Inc. and Idaho Power Company. 20   Additionally, a significant portion of Idaho Power Companysfacilities were constructed many years ago, which could affect reliability andincrease maintenance costs.  Failure of equipment or facilities used in IdahoPower Companys system could potentially increase repair and maintenanceexpenses, purchased power expenses, and capital expenditures. The performance of pension and postretirement benefitplan investments and other factors impacting plan costs could adversely impactcash flow and liquidity.  Idaho Power Company provides anoncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering most employees, as wellas a defined benefit postretirement benefit plan (consisting of health care anddeath benefits) that covers eligible retirees.  Costs of providing thesebenefits are based in part on the value of the plans assets and, therefore,adverse investment performance for these assets could increase Idaho PowerCompanys funding requirements related to the plans.  The key actuarialassumptions that affect expense are the expected long-term return on planassets and the discount rate used in determining future benefit obligations. Management evaluates the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis, taking intoaccount changes in market conditions, trends, and future expectations. Estimates of future stock market performance, changes in interest rates, andother factors used to develop the actuarial assumptions are uncertain, andactual results could vary significantly from the estimates.  Changes indemographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in lifeexpectancy assumptions, may also increase the funding requirements of theobligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Depending on the timing of contributions to the plans and the availability ofrecovery of costs through rates, cash contributions to the plans could impactIDACORP, Inc.s and Idaho Power Companys cash flow and liquidity. Complying with existing and future environmental lawsand regulations will increase capital expenditures and operating costs and mayreduce Idaho Power Companys earnings and cash flows and ability to meet theelectricity needs of its customers.  Idaho Power Company issubject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental statutes, rules,and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, natural resources, andhealth and safety.  Compliance with these environmental statutes, rules, andregulations involves significant capital and operating expenditures.  Members ofCongress have proposed legislation to limit and reduce greenhouse gasemissions, and the Environmental Protection Agency is taking action to addressclimate change and regulate greenhouse gas emissions, including the adoption ofnew reporting requirements that apply to Idaho Power Companys facilities.  TheEnvironmental Protection Agency has also made an endangerment finding forgreenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles and has indicated that the CleanAir Act will require it to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasemissions from major stationary sources, including Idaho Power Companysthermal facilities, once it adopts greenhouse gas emission standards for motorvehicles.  The adoption of a mandatory federal program or state programs toreduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions would raiseuncertainty about the future viability of fossil fuels, specifically coal, asan economical energy source for new and existing electric generationfacilities.  Mercury and other pollutant emissions from Idaho Power Companysthermal facilities are also subject to extensive regulation.  The adoption ofnew statutes, rules, and regulations to reduce emissions, including controls toreduce carbon dioxide, greenhouse gas, mercury, or other pollutant emissionswill result in increased capital expenditures and could increase the cost ofoperating coal-fired generating plants or make them uneconomical to operate andresult in reduced earnings and cash flows. Complying with state or federal renewable energyportfolio standards could increase capital expenditures and operating costs andreduce earnings and cash flows.  A number of states have adoptedrenewable energy portfolio standards.  Idaho Power Companys operations inOregon will be required to comply with a ten percent renewable energy portfoliostandard beginning in 2025, and it is possible that other states could adoptrenewable energy portfolio standards that are applicable to Idaho Power in thefuture.  New state or federal renewable energy portfolio standards couldincrease capital expenditures and operating costs and reduce earnings and cashflows. The listing asthreatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act of fish, wildlife, orplant species that are found in the areas of Idaho Power Companys generationfacilities or transmission lines may require mitigation, affect the location ofa project or the ability to construct a project, and result in increasedcapital expenditures and operating costs.  Relicensing of theHells Canyon and Swan Falls hydroelectric projects and the construction of theLangley Gulch power plant and the Gateway West and Boardman to Hemingwaytransmission lines require consultation under the Endangered Species Act todetermine the effects of these projects on any listed species within theproject areas.  The recent listing of 21   Tableofcontents  slickspot peppergrass as a threatened species will requirean Endangered Species Act consultation for the transmission and water lines forLangley Gulch as well as for the Gateway West and Boardman to Hemingwaytransmission lines, and future transmission projects.  Similarly, the presenceof sage grouse in the vicinity of Idaho Powers Boardman to Hemingway andGateway West 500-kV transmission line projects has required more extensive,costly, and time consuming evaluation and engineering.  The impact of theEndangered Species Act, including the potential listing of additional fish,wildlife, or plant species, and similar laws may require mitigation, cause adelay in relicensing or construction of projects, affect the location orability to construct a project, increase the costs of construction andoperations, and reduce earnings and cash flows. Conditions that may be imposed in connection withhydroelectric license renewals may require large capital expenditures, increaseoperating costs, reduce hydroelectric production, and reduce earnings and cashflows.  Idaho Power Company is currently involved in renewingfederal licenses for some of its hydroelectric projects, including its largesthydroelectric generation source, the Hells Canyon Complex.  Relicensingincludes an extensive public review process that involves numerous naturalresource issues and environmental conditions.  The listing of various speciesof marine life, wildlife, and plants as threatened or endangered has resultedin significant changes to federally-authorized activities, including those ofhydroelectric projects.  Salmon and other marine life recovery plans couldinclude further major operational changes to the regions hydroelectricprojects.  In addition, new interpretations of existing laws and regulationscould be adopted or become applicable to such facilities, which could furtherincrease required expenditures for marine life recovery and endangered species protectionand reduce the amount of hydroelectric generation available to meet Idaho PowerCompanys energy requirements. In 2007, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Staffissued a final environmental impact statement for the Hells Canyon Complex, whichthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will use in part to determine whether,and under what conditions, to issue a new license for the Hells CanyonComplex.  Certain portions of the final environmental impact statement involveissues that may be influenced by water quality certifications for the projectunder Section 401 of the Clean Water Act and formal consultations under theEndangered Species Act, which remain unresolved.  One significant issueinvolves water temperature gradients, and certain parties in the Hells CanyonComplex relicensing proceedings have advocated for the installation of watertemperature management apparatus which, if required to be installed, wouldrequire substantial capital expenditures to construct and maintain.  There canbe no assurance that recovery through rates would be authorized, particularlygiven the magnitude of any potential impact on customer rates, which at thistime cannot be accurately predicted.  Idaho Power Company also cannot predictthe requirements that might be imposed during the relicensing process, theeconomic impact of those requirements, or whether a new multi-year license willultimately be issued.  Imposition of onerous conditions in the relicensingprocess could result in Idaho Power incurring significant capital expenditures,increase operating costs, and reduce hydroelectric generation, which couldreduce earnings and cash flows. Idaho Power Companys business is subject tosubstantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by increasedcosts resulting from, or liability under, existing or future regulations orrequirements.  Idaho Power Company is subject to extensivefederal and state laws, policies, and regulations, as well as regulatoryactions and regulatory audits, including those of the Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission, the Environmental Protection Agency, the North American ElectricReliability Corporation, the Western Electricity Coordinating Council, and thepublic utility commissions in Idaho, Oregon, and Wyoming.  Some of theseregulations are changing or subject to interpretation, and failure to complymay result in penalties or other adverse consequences.  Idaho Power Company hasself-reported compliance issues to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission andto the Western Electricity Coordinating Council.  Several of the mattersself-reported to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the WesternElectricity Coordinating Council remain outstanding.  Compliance with theserequirements directly influences Idaho Power Companys operating environmentand may significantly increase Idaho Power Companys operating costs.  Further,potential monetary and non-monetary penalties for a violation of Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission regulations may be substantial, and in some circumstancesmonetary penalties may be as high as $1 million per day per violation.  Theimposition of penalties on Idaho Power Company could have an adverse impact onits and IDACORP, Inc.s results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.22   Tableofcontents   IDACORP, Inc., its subsidiary IDACORP Energy, andIdaho Power Company are subject to costs and other effects of legal andregulatory proceedings, settlements, investigations, and claims. IDACORP, Inc., IDACORP Energy, and Idaho Power Company are involved in a numberof proceedings, including the California refund proceeding, a portion of whichremains pending before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and  the UnitedStates Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit; a refund proceeding affectingsellers of wholesale power in the spot market in the Pacific Northwest; andshow cause proceedings originating at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,a portion of which remains pending in the United States Court of Appeals forthe Ninth Circuit.  It is possible that additional proceedings related to thewestern energy situation may be filed in the future against IDACORP, Inc.,IDACORP Energy, or Idaho Power Company.  IDACORP, Inc. and Idaho Power Companyare or may also be subject to costs and other effects of additional legalclaims, actions, and complaints, including those related to the Jim Bridger,Valmy, and Boardman coal-fired plants, in which Idaho Power Company holds anownership interest.  For instance, in September 2010, the EnvironmentalProtection Agency issued a Notice of Violation to Portland General ElectricCompany, the majority owner of the Boardman plant, alleging that PortlandGeneral Electric Company had violated the New Source Performance Standards andoperating permit requirements under the Clean Air Act, as a result ofmodifications made to the plant in 1998 and 2004.  State attorneys general havebrought actions against companies seeking additional disclosure of climatechange-related risks and impacts, and private parties have brought tort actionsagainst companies relating to their alleged contribution to climate change.  IfIDACORP, Inc., IDACORP Energy, or Idaho Power Company are required to makepayments in connection with any legal or regulatory proceeding, settlement,investigation, or claim, earnings and cash flows could be negatively affected. As a holding company, IDACORP, Inc. does not have itsown operating income and must rely on the upstream cash flows from itssubsidiaries to pay dividends and make debt payments.  IDACORP,Inc. is a holding company with no significant operations of its own, and itsprimary assets are shares or other ownership interests of its subsidiaries,primarily Idaho Power Company.  Consequently, IDACORP, Inc.s ability to paydividends and to service its debt is dependent upon dividends and otherpayments received from its subsidiaries.  IDACORP, Inc.s subsidiaries areseparate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amountsto IDACORP, Inc., whether through dividends, loans, or other payments.  Theability of IDACORP, Inc.s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributionsto IDACORP, Inc. depends on several factors, including each subsidiariesactual and projected earnings and cash flow, capital requirements and generalfinancial condition, regulatory restrictions, and the prior rights of holdersof their existing and future first mortgage bonds and other debt or equitysecurities. A downgrade in IDACORP, Inc.s and Idaho PowerCompanys credit ratings could negatively affect the companies ability toaccess capital, increase their cost of borrowing, and require the companies topost collateral with transaction counterparties.  Credit ratingagencies periodically review the corporate credit ratings and long-term ratingsof IDACORP, Inc. and Idaho Power Company.  IDACORP, Inc. and Idaho PowerCompany also have borrowing arrangements that rely on the ability of the banksto fund loans or support commercial paper.  Downgrades of IDACORP, Inc.s orIdaho Power Companys credit ratings, or those affecting relationship banks,could limit the companies ability to access capital, including the commercialpaper markets, require the companies to pay a higher interest rate on theirdebt, and require the companies to post collateral with transactioncounterparties. Volatility in the financial markets may negativelyaffect IDACORP, Inc.s and Idaho Power Companys ability to access capitaland/or increase their cost of borrowing, or result in losses on investments. IDACORP, Inc. and Idaho Power Company require liquidity to pay operatingexpenses and principal of and interest on debt and to finance capitalexpenditures not satisfied by cash flows from operations.  Financial marketshave in recent years experienced extreme volatility and disruption, generallyresulting in a decrease in the availability of liquidity and credit forborrowers.  In a volatile credit environment, one or more of the participatingbanks in IDACORP, Inc.s and Idaho Power Companys credit facilities maydefault on their obligations to make loans under, or withdraw from, the creditfacilities, or IDACORP, Inc.s and Idaho Power Companys access to capital mayotherwise be inhibited.  In addition, at times Idaho Power Company has arelatively large balance of short-term investments, particularly during timeswhen it has issued debt or equity securities to fund future debt maturities notyet due and capital expenditure requirements payable over time.  Volatility inthe financial markets may result in a lack of liquidity for short-terminvestments and declines in value of some investments.  The occurrence of anyof these events could adversely affect IDACORP, Inc.s and Idaho PowerCompanys earnings, liquidity, and financial condition. 23   Tableofcontents   National and regional economic conditions may causeincreased late payments and uncollectible accounts, which would reduce earningsand cash flows.  Recent concerns over energy costs, theavailability and cost of credit, declining business, and high rates ofunemployment contributed to a recent recession.  These factors have resulted,and may continue to result, in an increase in late payments and uncollectibleaccounts, which reduce IDACORP Inc.s and Idaho Power Companys earnings andcash flows. National and regional economic conditions, inconjunction with increased electric rates, may reduce energy consumption, whichmay reduce revenues and future growth.  Beginning in 2008,economic conditions in Idaho Power Companys service area have been relativelyweak.  Unemployment rates are high relative to historic unemployment levels andcustomer growth has been slow relative to prior years.  The recent recessionand increased rates may reduce the amount of energy Idaho Power Companyscustomers consume, result in a loss of customers, and reduce the customergrowth rate.  A decrease in overall customer usage may reduce revenues,earnings, and future growth. Changes in tax laws and regulations, or differinginterpretation or enforcement of applicable laws by the Internal RevenueService or other taxing jurisdictions, could have a material adverse impact onIDACORP, Inc.s or Idaho Power Companys financial condition. IDACORP, Inc. and Idaho Power Company must make judgments and interpretationsabout the application of the law when determining the provision for taxes.  Thecompanies tax obligations include income, real estate, public utility,municipal, sales and use, business and occupation, and employment-related taxesand ongoing issues related to these taxes.  These judgments may includereserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that may besubject to challenge by taxing authorities.  For instance, in September 2010,Idaho Power Company adopted a tax accounting method change for repair-relatedexpenditures on utility assets concurrent with the filing of IDACORP, Inc.s2009 consolidated federal income tax return.  Also in the third quarter of2010, Idaho Power Company reached an agreement with the Internal RevenueService, subject to subsequent review by the U.S. Congress Joint Committee onTaxation, regarding the allocation of mixed service costs in its method ofuniform capitalization.  The outcome of ongoing and future income taxproceedings such as these could differ materially from the amounts currentlyrecorded, and the difference could reduce IDACORP, Inc.s and Idaho PowerCompanys earnings and cash flows.  Further, in some instances the  treatmentfrom a ratemaking perspective of any benefits from tax-related projects, or thereversal of reserves recorded by IDACORP, Inc. or Idaho Power Company fortax-related matters such as those described above, could be different thanIDACORP, Inc. or Idaho Power Company currently anticipate  or in the futurerequest from the regulatory bodies.  The Idaho Public Utilities Commission orOregon Public Utility Commission could, for instance, determine that all or aportion of any benefits resulting from tax-related projects be shared withcustomers in the form of reduced rates or otherwise, which may reduce revenue,earnings, and cash flows. Employee workforce factors could increase costs andreduce earnings.  Idaho Power Company is subject to workforcefactors, including, but not limited to, loss or retirement of key personnel,availability of qualified personnel, an aging workforce, and impacts of effortsto organize workforce, including the possible unionization of one or moresegments of the workforce.  Idaho Power Companys operations require a skilledworkforce to perform specialized, complex utility functions.  Idaho PowerCompany expects that a significant portion of its skilled workforce will beretiring within the coming decade, which places demand on Idaho Power Companyto attract and retain skilled workers.  Without a skilled workforce, IdahoPower Companys ability to provide quality service to its customers and meetregulatory requirements will be challenged and could affect earnings.  Also, thecosts associated with attracting and retaining appropriately qualifiedemployees to replace an aging workforce could reduce earnings and cash flows. Terrorist threats and activities could result inreduced revenues and increased costs.  Idaho Power Companysgeneration and transmission facilities are potential targets for terroristthreats and activities.  The possibility that infrastructure facilities, suchas fossil and hydroelectric generation facilities and electric transmission anddistribution facilities, would be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of,an act of terror may affect Idaho Power Companys operations.  Instability inthe financial markets as a result of terrorism, war, and similar actions mayalso affect Idaho Power Companys results of operations and its ability toraise capital.  Further, the implementation of security guidelines and measureshas resulted in and is expected to continue to result in increased compliancecosts. 24   Tableofcontents    IDACORP, Inc. and Idaho Power Company could bevulnerable to security breaches or other similar events that could disrupttheir operations, require significant capital expenditures, and/or result inclaims against the companies.  In the normal course of business,Idaho Power Company collects, processes, and retains sensitive and confidentialcustomer and proprietary information, and operates systems that directly impactthe availability of electric power and the transmission of electric power inthe electric grid.  Despite the security measures in place, Idaho PowerCompanys facilities and systems, and those of third-party service providers,could be vulnerable to security breaches or other similar events that couldinterrupt operations, resulting in a shutdown of service and expose Idaho PowerCompany to liability.  In addition, Idaho Power Company may be required toexpend significant capital and other resources to protect against securitybreaches or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches. Idaho Power Companys ability to enter intoover-the-counter derivatives and hedge commodity and interest rate risk may beadversely affected by recent federal legislation.  In July 2010,Congress enacted, and President Obama signed, financial reform legislationknown as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.  TitleVII of the legislation provides for the regulation of the over-the-counterderivatives market, and requires the posting of cash collateral for unclearedswaps.  If the rules enacted under the legislation require that Idaho PowerCompany post cash collateral on its swap or derivative transactions, itsliquidity may be adversely affected, and rules promulgated under thelegislation may impair Idaho Power Companys ability to enter intoover-the-counter derivatives to hedge commodity and interest rate risks. "
8,IDA,IDACORP INC,2010-02-23,"ITEM 1A.  RISKFACTORS The following are factors that could have a significantimpact on the operations and financial results of IDACORP, Inc. and Idaho PowerCompany and could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially fromthose discussed in any forward-looking statements:  Reduced hydroelectric generation can reduce revenues andincrease costs, and reduce earnings and cash flows.  Idaho Power Companyhas a predominately hydroelectric generating base.  Because of Idaho PowerCompanys heavy reliance on hydroelectric generation, water can significantlyaffect its operations.  When hydroelectric generation is reduced, Idaho PowerCompany must increase its use of generally more expensive thermal generatingresources and purchased power and opportunities for off-system sales arereduced, which reduces revenues.  In addition, while Idaho Power Company canexpect to recover the majority of the net power supply costs above the levelincluded in its rates, recovery of the excess amounts does not occur until thesubsequent power cost adjustment year.  Continuing declines in stream flows and over-appropriation ofwater in Idaho may reduce hydroelectric generation and revenues and increasecosts.  The combination of declining Snake River base flows,over-appropriation of water and drought conditions have led to disputes amongsurface water and ground water irrigators, and the state of Idaho.  Rechargingthe Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer, which contributes to Snake River flows, bydiverting surface water to porous locations and permitting it to sink into theaquifer is one proposed solution to the dispute.  Diversions from the SnakeRiver for aquifer recharge may further reduce Snake River flows available forhydroelectric generation and reduce Idaho Power Companys revenues and increasecosts.  Idaho Power Companys recent settlement agreement with the state ofIdaho resolves litigation regarding certain Idaho Power Company water rights onthe Snake River and provides for ongoing Snake River water issues to beaddressed in the comprehensive aquifer management plan process.  However, thereis no assurance that this process will lead to increased Snake River streamflows for Idaho Power Companys hydroelectric projects.  Idaho Power Companyalso has initiated legal action against the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation over theinterpretation and effect of a 1923 contract with the U.S. Bureau ofReclamation on the operation of the American Falls Reservoir and the release ofwater from that reservoir to be used at Idaho Power Companys downstreamhydroelectric projects.  The comprehensive aquifer management plan process andthe resolution of the litigation may affect Snake River flows available forhydroelectric generation and thereby reduce Idaho Power Company revenues andincrease costs.  Idaho Power Companys reliance on coal and natural gas to fuelits power generation facilities exposes it to risk of increased costs andreduced earnings.  In addition to hydroelectric generation, Idaho PowerCompany relies on coal and natural gas to fuel its generation facilities. Market price increases in coal and natural gas can result in reduced earnings. Increases in demand for natural gas, including increases in demand due togreater industry reliance on natural gas for power generation, may result inmarket price increases, short-term price volatility and/or supply availabilityissues.  In addition, delivery of coal and natural gas depends upon gaspipelines, rail lines, rail cars and roadways.  Any disruption in Idaho PowerCompanys fuel supply may require the company to find alternative fuel sourcesat higher costs, to produce power from higher cost generation facilities or topurchase power from other sources at higher costs.  Load growth in Idaho Power Companys service territory exposesit to greater market and operational risk and could increase costs and reduceearnings and cash flows.o   Increases in both the number of customers and the demand forenergy have resulted and may continue to result in increased reliance onpurchased power to meet customer load requirements.  The price volatility ofelectricity has substantially increased from what it was at the inception ofthe power cost adjustment.  While Idaho Power Company can expect to recover themajority of the net power supply costs above the amounts included in its rates,recovery of the excess amounts does not occur until the subsequent power costadjustment year, and the remaining amount is absorbed by Idaho Power Companywhich could increase costs and reduce earnings and cash flows.o   Load growth can result in the need for additional investments inIdaho Power Companys infrastructure to serve the new load.  If Idaho PowerCompany were unable to secure timely rate relief from the Idaho PublicUtilities Commission, the Oregon Public Utility Commission or the FederalEnergy Regulatory Commission to recover the costs of these additionalinvestments, the resulting regulatory lag would have a negative effect onearnings and cash flows.15      o   Load growth can create planning and operating difficulties for IdahoPower Company that can negatively impact its ability to reliably servecustomers.  Weather can reduce power sales and revenues and reduceearnings and cash flows.  Warmer than normal winters, cooler than normalsummers and increased rainfall during the irrigation seasons will reduce retailrevenues from power sales and may impact the amount and timing of hydroelectricgeneration.  Extreme weather events can disrupt transmission and distributionsystems and cause service interruptions and extended outages, and potentiallyinterrupt use of generation resources.  Disruption in transmission anddistribution systems increases operations and maintenance expenses and reducesearnings and cash flows.  Idaho Power Companys risk management policy and programs relatingto hedging power and gas exposures and counterparty creditworthiness may notalways perform as intended, and we may suffer economic losses.  Idaho PowerCompany actively manages the market risk inherent in its energy relatedactivities and counterparty credit positions.  Idaho Power Company hasprocedures that monitor compliance with our risk management policies andprograms, including verification of transactions, regular portfolio reportingof various risk management metrics and daily counterparty credit riskanalysis.  However, actual hydroelectric and thermal generation, transmissionavailability and market prices may be significantly different than thoseoriginally planned for when we enter into our risk management positions.  Thehigh volatility of these items creates uncertainty in the appropriate amount ofhedging activity to pursue.  Forecasts of future loads and available resourcesto meet those loads are inherently uncertain and may cause Idaho Power Companyto over- or under-hedge actual resource needs, exposing the company to marketrisk on the over- or under-hedged position.  Changes in market prices are alsounpredictable and can at times result in Idaho Power Companys hedged positionsperforming less favorably than unhedged positions.  In addition, Idaho PowerCompanys counterparty credit policies may not prevent counterparties fromfailing to perform, forcing the company to replace forward contracts withtransactions in the open market.  As a result, risk management decisions mayhave significant impacts if actual events result in greater losses or costs indelivering energy to customers and could negatively affect financial condition,results of operations or cash flows.  Increased capital expenditures can significantly affectliquidity.  Increases in both the number of customers and the demand forenergy require expansion and reinforcement of transmission and distributionsystems and generating facilities.  If Idaho Power Company does not receivetimely regulatory recovery, Idaho Power Company will have to rely more onexternal financing for its future utility construction expenditures.  Theselarge planned expenditures may weaken the consolidated financial profile ofIDACORP, Inc. and Idaho Power Company.  Additionally, a significant portion ofIdaho Power Companys facilities were constructed many years ago.  Agingequipment, even if maintained in accordance with industry practices, mayrequire significant capital expenditures.  Failure of equipment or facilitiesused in Idaho Power Companys system could potentially increase repair andmaintenance expenses, purchased power expenses and capital expenditures.  If the Idaho Public Utilities Commission, the Oregon PublicUtility Commission or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission grant less raterecovery in rate case filings than Idaho Power Company needs to cover increasedcosts of providing services, earnings and cash flows may be reduced.  Ifthe Idaho Public Utilities Commission, the Oregon Public Utility Commission orthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission grant less rate recovery in rate casefilings than Idaho Power Company needs to cover increased costs of providingservices, it may have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows and couldresult in downgrades of IDACORP, Inc.s and Idaho Power Companys creditratings.  Climate change could affect customer demand and hydroelectricgeneration and disrupt transmission and distribution systems, reducing earningsand cash flows.  Long-term climate change could affect Idaho Power Companysbusiness in a variety of ways, including: (i) changes in temperature andprecipitation could affect customer demand, (ii) extreme weather events couldincrease service interruptions, outages, and maintenance costs; (iii) changesin the amount and timing of snowpack and stream flows could adversely affecthydroelectric generation, and (iv) legislative and/or regulatory developmentsrelated to climate change could affect plans and operations including placingrestrictions on the construction of new generation resources, the expansion ofexisting resources, or the operation of generation resources in general, and(v) consumer preference for, and resource planning decisions requiring,renewable or low GHG-emitting sources of energy could impact demand from existingsources and require significant investment in new generation and transmissionresources.  Any of these effects of climate change could reduce Idaho PowerCompanys earnings and cash flows.16        Complying with environmental laws and regulations will increasecapital expenditures and operating costs and may reduce Idaho Power Companysearnings and cash flows and ability to meet the electricity needs of itscustomers.  Idaho Power Company is subject to extensive federal, state andlocal environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality,water quality, natural resources and health and safety.  Compliance with theseenvironmental statutes, rules and regulations involves significant capital andoperating expenditures.  Congress is considering legislation to limit andreduce greenhouse gas emissions, and the Environmental Protection Agency istaking action to address climate change and regulate greenhouse gas emissions,including the adoption of new reporting requirements that apply to Idaho PowerCompanys facilities.  The Environmental Protection Agency has also made anendangerment finding for greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles and hasindicated that the Clean Air Act will require it to regulate carbon dioxide andother greenhouse gas emissions from major stationary sources, including IdahoPower Companys thermal facilities, once it adopts greenhouse gas emissionstandards for motor vehicles.  The adoption of a mandatory federal program toreduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions would raiseuncertainty about the future viability of fossil fuels, specifically coal, asan economical energy source for new and existing electric generationfacilities.  Mercury and other pollutant emissions from Idaho Power Companys thermalfacilities are also subject to extensive regulation.  The adoption of newstatutes, rules and regulations to reduce emissions, including controls toreduce carbon dioxide, greenhouse gas, mercury or other pollutant emissionswill result in increased capital expenditures and could increase the cost ofoperating coal-fired generating plants or make them uneconomical to operate andresult in reduced earnings and cash flows.  Complying with state or federal renewable energy portfoliostandards could increase capital expenditures and operating costs and reduceearnings and cash flows.  A number of states have adopted renewable energyportfolio standards.  Idaho Power Companys operations in Oregon will berequired to comply with a ten percent renewable energy portfolio standardbeginning in 2025, and it is possible that Idaho and other states in whichIdaho Power Company operates or sells power could adopt renewable energyportfolio standards in the future.  A bill passed by the U.S. House ofRepresentatives on June 26, 2009, would, if enacted, require utilities toobtain as much as 20 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by2020 and reduce demand by an additional 5 percent through conservation andincreased energy efficiency.  A bill pending in the U.S. Senate would require15 percent of electricity from renewable sources by 2021.  New state or federalrenewable energy portfolio standards could increase capital expenditures andoperating costs and reduce earnings and cash flows.  The listing as threatened or endangered under the EndangeredSpecies Act of fish, wildlife or plant species that are found in the areas ofIdaho Power Companys generation facilities or transmission lines may requiremitigation, affect the location of a project or the ability to construct aproject and result in increased capital expenditures and operating costs. Relicensing of the Hells Canyon and Swan Falls hydroelectric projects and theconstruction of Langley Gulch and the Gateway West and Boardman to Hemingwaytransmission lines require consultation under the Endangered Species Act todetermine the effects of these projects on any listed species within theproject areas.  The recent listing of slickspot peppergrass as a threatenedspecies will require an Endangered Species Act consultation for thetransmission and water lines for Langley Gulch as well as for the Gateway Westand Boardman to Hemingway transmission lines.  This listing may also affectIdaho Power Companys ability to purchase wind power from any wind power farmsthat were to be built in these areas.  Any negative effects of the listing ofslickspot peppergrass or any other species under the Endangered Species Act mayrequire mitigation, cause a delay in relicensing or construction of projects,affect the location or ability to construct a project and increase the costs ofconstruction and operations.  Conditions that may be imposed in connection withhydroelectric license renewals may require large capital expenditures, increaseoperating costs, reduce hydroelectric production and reduce earnings and cashflows.  Idaho Power Company is currently involved in renewing federallicenses for several of its hydroelectric projects.  The Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission may impose conditions with respect to environmental,operating and other matters in connection with the renewal of Idaho PowerCompanys licenses.  These conditions could have a negative effect on IdahoPower Companys operations, require large capital expenditures and increaseoperating costs, reduce hydroelectric production and reduce earnings and cashflows.17        Idaho Power Companys business is subject to substantialgovernmental regulation and may be adversely affected by increased costsresulting from, or liability under, existing or future regulations orrequirements.  Idaho Power Company is subject to extensive federal andstate laws, policies, and regulations, as well as regulatory actions andregulatory audits, including those of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,the Environmental Protection Agency, the North American Electric ReliabilityCorporation, the Western Electricity Coordinating Council and the publicutility commissions in Idaho, Oregon and Wyoming.  Some of these regulationsare changing or subject to interpretation, and failure to comply may result inpenalties or other adverse consequences.  Idaho Power Company has reportedcompliance issues to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and the WesternElectricity Coordinating Council has recently completed an audit of reliabilitystandards.  Compliance with these requirements directly influences Idaho PowerCompanys operating environment and may significantly increase Idaho PowerCompanys operating costs.  IDACORP, Inc., its affiliate IDACORP Energy and Idaho PowerCompany are subject to costs and other effects of legal and regulatoryproceedings, settlements, investigations and claims.  IDACORP, Inc.,IDACORP Energy and Idaho Power Company are involved in a number of proceedings,including the California refund proceeding, a portion of which remains pendingbefore the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and  the United States Court ofAppeals for the Ninth Circuit; a refund proceeding affecting sellers ofwholesale power in the spot market in the Pacific Northwest; and show causeproceedings originating at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, a portionof which remains pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the NinthCircuit.  It is possible that additional proceedings related to the westernenergy situation may be filed in the future against IDACORP, Inc., IDACORPEnergy or Idaho Power Company.  IDACORP, Inc. and Idaho Power Company are ormay also be subject to costs and other effects of additional legal claims,actions and complaints, including those related to the Jim Bridger, Valmy andBoardman coal-fired plants, in which Idaho Power Company holds an ownershipinterest.  State attorneys general have brought actions against companies,seeking additional disclosure of climate change-related risks and impacts, andprivate parties have brought tort actions against companies relating to theiralleged contribution to climate change.  If IDACORP, Inc., IDACORP Energy orIdaho Power Company are required to make payments in connection with any legalor regulatory proceeding, settlement, investigation or claim, earnings and cashflows could be negatively affected.  As a holding company, IDACORP, Inc. does not have its ownoperating income and must rely on the upstream cash flows from its subsidiariesto pay dividends and make debt payments.  IDACORP, Inc. is a holdingcompany and thus its primary assets are shares or other ownership interests ofits subsidiaries, primarily Idaho Power Company.  Consequently, IDACORP, Inc.sability to pay dividends and to service its debt is dependent upon dividendsand other payments received from its subsidiaries.  IDACORP, Inc.ssubsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation topay any amounts to IDACORP, Inc., whether through dividends, loans or other payments. The ability of IDACORP, Inc.s subsidiaries to pay dividends or makedistributions to IDACORP, Inc. depends on several factors, including theiractual and projected earnings and cash flow, capital requirements and generalfinancial condition, regulatory restrictions, and the prior rights of holdersof their existing and future first mortgage bonds and other debt securities.  A downgrade in IDACORP, Inc.s and Idaho Power Companyscredit ratings could negatively affect the companies ability to accesscapital, increase their cost of borrowing, and require the companies to postcollateral with transaction counterparties.  Credit rating agenciesperiodically review the corporate credit ratings and long-term ratings ofIDACORP, Inc. and Idaho Power Company.  IDACORP, Inc. and Idaho Power Companyalso have borrowing arrangements that rely on the ability of the banks to fundloans or support commercial paper.  Downgrades of IDACORP, Inc.s or IdahoPower Companys credit ratings, or those affecting relationship banks, couldlimit the companies ability to access capital, including the commercial papermarkets, require the companies to pay a higher interest rate on their debt andrequire the companies to post collateral with transaction counterparties.  Volatility and decreased lending capacity in the financialmarkets may negatively affect IDACORP, Inc.s and Idaho Power Companys abilityto access capital and/or increase their cost of borrowing.  IDACORP, Inc.and Idaho Power Company require liquidity to pay operating expenses andprincipal of and interest on debt and to finance capital expenditures. Financial markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption, causingthe cost of borrowing to rise and the availability of liquidity and credit forborrowers to decrease; As a result, IDACORP, Inc. and Idaho Power Company mayexperience higher interest costs and/or be unable to access capital, includingthe commercial paper markets.  These conditions may adversely affect IDACORP,Inc.s and Idaho Power Companys results of operations, financial condition andcash flows.18        One or more of the banks participating in IDACORP, Inc.s andIdaho Power Companys credit facilities could default on their obligations tofund loans requested by the companies or could withdraw from participation inthe credit facilities, which could negatively affect cash flows and the abilityto meet capital requirements.  IDACORP, Inc. and Idaho Power Company have$100 million and $300 million multi-year revolving credit facilities,respectively, with a group of lender banks that expire in April 2012.  Thesefacilities supplement operating cash flow and provide a primary source ofliquidity.  The facilities are also used as backup for commercial paperborrowings and are available for general corporate purposes.  IDACORP, Inc. andIdaho Power Company are subject to the risk that one or more of theparticipating banks may default on their obligations to make loans under thecredit facilities.  IDACORP, Inc. and Idaho Power Companys inability to obtainloans under their respective credit facilities as needed could negativelyaffect cash flows and the ability to meet capital requirements.  IDACORP and Idaho Power Company may incur losses on theirinvestments or be unable to sell their investments when they desire to do so,which could adversely affect their liquidity and financial condition. IDACORP and Idaho Power Company invest cash in short-term interest bearingaccounts, including money market funds.  Volatility in the financial marketsmay result in a lack of liquidity and declines in value of some money marketfunds.  The companies may realize additional losses on some or all of theirinvested funds or be unable to sell their investments when they desire to doso.  This could adversely affect IDACORPs and Idaho Power Companys liquidityand financial condition.  National and regional economic conditions may cause increasedlate payments and uncollectible accounts, which would reduce earnings and cashflows.  Recent concerns over energy costs, the availability and cost ofcredit, declining business and increased unemployment have contributed to arecession.  These factors have resulted, and may continue to result, in anincrease in late payments and uncollectible accounts and reduce IDACORP Inc.sand Idaho Power Companys earnings and cash flows.  National and regional economic conditions, in conjunction withincreased electric rates, may reduce energy consumption, which may reducerevenues and future growth.  The present economic recession and increasedrates may reduce the amount of energy our customers consume, result in a lossof customers and reduce customer growth.  A decrease in overall customer usagemay reduce revenues, earnings, and future growth.  Adverse results of income tax audits could reduce earnings andcash flows.  The outcome of ongoing and future income tax audits coulddiffer materially from the amounts currently recorded, and the difference couldreduce IDACORPs and Idaho Power Companys earnings and cash flows.  Employee workforce factors could increase costs and reduceearnings.  Idaho Power Company is subject to workforce factors, including,but not limited to, loss or retirement of key personnel, availability ofqualified personnel, an aging workforce, and impacts of efforts to organizeworkforce, including the possible unionization of one or more segments of theworkforce.  The costs of attracting and retaining appropriately qualifiedemployees to replace an aging workforce could reduce earnings and cash flows.  Terrorist threats and activities could result in reducedrevenues and increased costs.  IDACORP, Inc. and Idaho Power Company aresubject to direct and indirect effects of terrorist threats and activities. Potential targets include generation and transmission facilities.  The effectsof terrorist threats and activities could prevent Idaho Power Company frompurchasing, generating or transmitting power and result in reduced revenues andincreased costs.  IDACORP, Inc. and Idaho Power Company could be vulnerable tosecurity breaches or other similar events that could disrupt their operations,require significant capital expenditures and/or result in claims against thecompanies.  In the normal course of business, Idaho Power Company collects,processes and retains sensitive and confidential customer and proprietaryinformation.  Despite the security measures in place, Idaho Power Companysfacilities and systems, and those of third-party service providers, could bevulnerable to security breaches or other similar events that could interruptoperations, resulting in a shutdown of service and expose Idaho Power Companyto liability.  In addition, Idaho Power Company may be required to expendsignificant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches orto alleviate problems caused by security breaches. "

10-12"
6,IDA,IDACORP INC,2006-03-07,"ITEM 1A.  RISKFACTORSThe following are factors that could have a significantimpact on the operations and financial results of IDACORP, Inc. and Idaho PowerCompany and could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially fromthose discussed in any forward-looking statements:Reduced hydroelectric generationcan reduce revenues and increase costs.  Idaho PowerCompany has a predominately hydroelectric generating base.  Because of Idaho Power Company's heavyreliance on hydroelectric generation, the weather can significantly affect itsoperations.  Idaho Power Company experiencedits sixth consecutive year of below normal water conditions in 2005.  When hydroelectric generation is reduced,Idaho Power Company must increase its use of more expensive thermal generatingresources and purchased power.  Throughits power cost adjustment in Idaho, Idaho Power Company can expect to recoverapproximately 90 percent of the increase in its Idaho jurisdictional net powersupply costs, which are fuel and purchased power less off-system sales, abovethe level included in its base rates. The power cost adjustment recovery includes both a forecast anddeferrals that are subject to the regulatory process.  However, recovery of amounts above forecastin one power cost adjustment year does not occur until the subsequent power costadjustment year.  The non-Idaho net powersupply costs are subject to periodic recovery from the Oregon and FederalEnergy Regulatory Commission jurisdictional customers.Continuing declines in streamflows and over-appropriation of water in Idaho will reduce hydroelectricgeneration and revenues and increase costs.  Thecombination of declining Snake River base flows, over-appropriation of waterand continuing drought conditions have led to disputes among surface water andground water irrigators, and the State of Idaho.  Recharging the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer,which contributes to Snake River flows, by diverting surface water to porouslocations and permitting it to sink into the aquifer is one proposed solutionto the dispute.  Idaho Power Companybelieves diversions from the Snake River for aquifer recharge may furtherreduce Snake River flows available for hydroelectric generation and reduceIdaho Power Company revenues and increase costs.Changes in temperature andprecipitation can reduce power sales and revenues.  Warmer than normal winters, cooler than normalsummers and increased rainfall during the irrigation seasons will reduce retailrevenues from power sales.If the Idaho Public UtilitiesCommission, the Oregon Public Utility Commission or the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission grant less rate relief than requested in rate case filings,it will reduce Idaho Power Company's earnings and cash flows. If the Idaho Public Utilities Commission, the Oregon Public UtilityCommission or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission were to grant less raterelief than Idaho Power Company requests in its rate case filings, it couldhave a negative effect on earnings and cash flow and result in futuredowngrades of IDACORP, Inc.'s and Idaho Power Company's credit ratings.Conditions that may be imposed inconnection with hydroelectric license renewals may require large capitalexpenditures and reduce earnings and cash flows. Idaho Power Company is currently involved in renewing federal licensesfor several of its hydroelectric projects. Conditions with respect to environmental, operating and other mattersthat the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission may impose in connection with therenewal of Idaho Power Company's licenses could have a negative effect on IdahoPower Company's operations, require large capital expenditures and reduceearnings and cash flows.The cost of complying withenvironmental regulations can reduce earnings and cash flows. IDACORP, Inc. and Idaho Power Company are subject to extensive federal,state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality,water quality, natural resources and health and safety.  Compliance with these environmental statutes,rules and regulations involves significant capital, operating and other costs,and those costs could be even more significant in the future as a result ofchanges in legislation and enforcement policies.  For instance, considerable attention has beenfocused on carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired generating plants and theirpotential role in contributing to global warming.  Mercury emissions from coal-fired plants arealso being discussed.  The adoption ofnew laws and regulations to implement carbon dioxide, mercury or other emissioncontrols could increase the cost of operating coal-fired generating plants andreduce earnings and cash flows.IDACORP, Inc., IDACORP Energy andIdaho Power Company are subject to costs and other effects of legal andregulatory proceedings, settlements, investigations and claims, including thosethat have arisen out of the western energy situation. IDACORP, Inc., IDACORP Energy and Idaho Power Company are involved in anumber of proceedings including a cross-action wholesale electric antitrustcase against various sellers and generators of power in California and theCalifornia refund proceeding at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  Other cases that are the direct or indirectresult of the western energy situation include a refund proceeding affectingsellers of wholesale power in the spot market in the Pacific Northwest, inwhich the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission directed that no refunds bepaid, but which is now pending on appeal before the United States Court ofAppeals for the Ninth Circuit; efforts by other parties to reform or terminatecontracts for the purchase of power from IDACORP Energy or claiming violationsof state and federal antitrust acts and dysfunctional energy markets as theresult of market manipulation; show cause proceedings at the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission, which have been settled but are the subject of motionsfor rehearing or have been appealed; claims pending before the United StatesCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that the Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission-ordered refund period should have been expanded to include a longertime period, and the reversal by the United States Court of Appeals for theNinth Circuit of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rulings that market-basedsellers' transactional reports satisfy the Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission's filed-rate doctrine requirements as a means of expanding refundsfrom all sellers of wholesale power, which rulings remain pending before theUnited States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on rehearing.  To the extent the companies are required tomake payments, earnings will be negatively affected.  It is possible that additional proceedingsrelated to the western energy situation may be filed in the future againstIDACORP, Inc., IDACORP Energy or Idaho Power Company.Pending shareholder litigationcould be costly, time consuming and, if adversely decided, result insubstantial liabilities.  Two securities shareholderlawsuits consolidated by order dated August 31, 2004 have been filed againstIDACORP, Inc. and four of its officers and directors.  Securities litigation can be costly,time-consuming and disruptive to normal business operations.  Costs below a self-insured retention are notcovered by insurance policies.  WhileIDACORP, Inc. cannot predict the outcome of these matters and these matterswill take time to resolve, damages arising from these lawsuits if resolvedagainst IDACORP, Inc. or in connection with any settlement, absent insurancecoverage or damages in excess of insurance coverage, could have a materialadverse effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows ofIDACORP, Inc.Increased capital expenditurescan significantly affect liquidity.  Increases in boththe number of customers and the demand for energy require expansion andreinforcement of transmission, distribution and generating systems.  If Idaho Power Company does not receivetimely regulatory relief, Idaho Power Company will have to rely more onexternal financing for its planned utility construction expenditures from 2006through 2008; these large planned expenditures may weaken the consolidated financialprofile of Idaho Power Company and IDACORP, Inc.  Additionally, a significant portion of IdahoPower Company's facilities were constructed many years ago.  Aging equipment, even if maintained inaccordance with good engineering practices, may require significant capitalexpenditures.  Failure of equipment orfacilities used in Idaho Power Company's systems could potentially increaserepair and maintenance expenses, purchased power expenses and capitalexpenditures.If losses at the non-regulatedsubsidiaries continue and if they are unable to obtain financing, this mayreduce IDACORP, Inc.'s earnings and cash flow. IdaTech and IDACOMM have experienced operating losses and it is notcertain that they will achieve or sustain profitability in the future.  If these non-regulated subsidiaries do notachieve profitability or are unable to obtain financing to fund theiroperations, this could increase the need for IDACORP, Inc. to provide liquidityin the form of capital contributions or loans and/or increase the need forIDACORP to pursue other strategic alternatives including possible sale, mergeror dissolution.  Any of these actionscould have a negative impact on IDACORP, Inc.'s earnings and cash flows.  In addition, if the value of thesesubsidiaries declines, IDACORP, Inc. may need to evaluate for possible assetimpairment charges.A downgrade in IDACORP, Inc.'sand Idaho Power Company's credit ratings could negatively affect the companies'ability to access capital.  On November 29, 2004,Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, on December 3, 2004, Moody's InvestorsService, and on January 24, 2005, Fitch, Inc. each downgraded IDACORP, Inc.'sand Idaho Power Company's credit ratings. These downgrades and any future downgrades of IDACORP, Inc.'s or IdahoPower Company's credit ratings could limit the companies' ability to access thecapital markets, including the commercial paper markets.  In addition, IDACORP, Inc. and Idaho PowerCompany would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate on existing short-termand variable rate debt and in future financings.Terrorist threats and activitiescould result in reduced revenues and increased costs.  IDACORP, Inc. and Idaho Power Company are subject todirect and indirect effects of terrorist threats and activities.  Potential targets include generation andtransmission facilities.  The effects ofterrorist threats and activities could prevent Idaho Power Company frompurchasing, generating or transmitting power and result in reduced revenues andincreased costs.Adverse results of income taxaudits could reduce earnings and cash flows.  In March2005, the Internal Revenue Service began its examination of IDACORP's 2001through 2003 tax years.  On October 24,2005, the Idaho State Tax Commission also began its examination of the same taxyears.  Outcome of the audits coulddiffer materially from the amounts currently recorded, and the difference couldreduce IDACORP's and Idaho Power Company's earnings and cash flows"
