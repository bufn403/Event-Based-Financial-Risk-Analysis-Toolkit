12,REX,REX AMERICAN RESOURCES CORP,2024-03-29,"Risk Factors
 We encourage you to carefully consider the risksdescribed below and other information contained in this report when considering an investment decision in REX common stock. Any of theevents discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If one or more of these events do occur, our results of operations, financial conditionor cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In this instance, the trading price of REX stock could decline, and investors mightlose all or part of their investment. Risks Related to our Ethanol and By-ProductsBusiness The ethanol industry is changing rapidly whichcould result in unexpected developments that could negatively impact our operations. According to the RFA, the ethanol industry grewfrom approximately 1.5 billion gallons of domestic annual ethanol production in 1999 to a peak of approximately 16.1 billion gallons in2018. In 2023 and 2022, the industry produced approximately 15.6 and 15.4 billion gallons, respectively, with the reduction from the peakyear reflecting industry conditions and reduced demand. Thus, there have been significant changes in the supply and demand of ethanolover a relatively short period of time which could lead to difficulty in maintaining profitable operations at our ethanol plants. The financial returns on our ethanol investmentsare highly dependent on commodity prices, which are subject to significant volatility, uncertainty and regional supply shortages, so ourresults could fluctuate substantially. The financial returns on ourethanol investments are highly dependent on commodity prices, especially prices for corn, natural gas, ethanol, distillers grains, distillerscorn oil and gasoline, and availability of corn. As a result of the volatility of the prices for these items, our returns may fluctuatesubstantially and our investments could experience periods of declining prices for their products and increasing costs for their raw materials,which could result in operating losses at our ethanol plants. The gross margin at our ethanolplants depends principally on the spread between ethanol, distillers grains, distillers corn oil, and corn prices. Fluctuations in thespread are likely to continue to occur. A sustained narrow or negative spread, whether as a result of sustained high or increased cornprices or sustained low or decreased ethanol prices, would adversely affect the results of operations at our ethanol plants. Our returns on ethanolinvestments are highly sensitive to corn prices. Corn is the principal raw materialour ethanol plants use to produce ethanol and by-products. As a result, changes in the price of corn can significantly affect our businesses.Rising corn prices result in higher production costs of ethanol and by-products. Because ethanol competes with non-corn-based fuels, ourethanol plants may not be able to pass along increased grain costs to our customers. At certain levels, grain prices may make ethanoluneconomical to produce. The price of corn is influencedby weather conditions and other factors affecting crop yields, transportation costs, farmer planting decisions, exports, foreign production,the value of the U.S. dollar, and general domestic 9and foreign economic, marketand regulatory factors, including, but not limited to, the impacts from the Russian-Ukraine conflict as well as other conflicts and politicalunrest, both foreign and domestic. These factors include government policies and subsidies with respect to agriculture and internationaltrade and global and local demand and supply. The significance and relative effect of these factors on the price of corn is difficultto predict. Any event that tends to negatively affect the production and/or supply of corn, such as adverse weather or crop disease, couldincrease corn prices and potentially harm the business of our ethanol plants, to include intermittent production slowdowns or stoppages.Increasing domestic ethanol production could boost the demand for corn and result in increased corn prices. International demand for corncould also result in higher corn prices. Our ethanol plants may also have difficulty, from time to time, in physically sourcing corn oneconomic terms due to regional supply shortages, transportation issues, delays in farmer marketing decisions or unfavorable local pricing.The corn harvest near our NuGen facility for 2022 was negatively impacted by dry weather and impacted the supply of corn until the 2023harvest. Such a shortage or price impact could require our ethanol plants to suspend operations which would have a material adverse effecton our consolidated results of operations. Our risk management strategiesmay be ineffective and may expose us to decreased profitability and liquidity. In an attempt to partially offsetthe impact of volatility of commodity prices, we enter into: i) forward contracts to sell a portion of our ethanol, distillers grains,and distillers corn oil production and to purchase a portion of our corn and natural gas requirements and; ii) commodity futures and swapagreements. The financial impact of these risk management activities is dependent upon, among other items, the prices involved and ourability to receive or deliver the commodities involved. Risk management activities can result in financial loss when positions are purchasedin a declining market or when positions are sold in an increasing market. In addition, we may not be able to match the appropriate quantityof corn contracts with quantities of ethanol, distillers grains and distillers corn oil contracts. Further, ourresults may be impacted by a mismatch of gains or losses associated with the positions during a reporting period when the physical commoditypurchase or sale has not yet occurred. We vary the amount and type of risk management techniques we utilize, and we may choosenot to engage in any risk management activities. Should we fail to properly manage the inherent volatility of commodity prices, our resultsof operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. The market for naturalgas is subject to market conditions that create uncertainty in the price and availability of the natural gas that our ethanol plants usein their manufacturing process. Our ethanol plants rely uponthird parties for their supply of natural gas, which is consumed as fuel in the production process. The prices for and availability ofnatural gas are subject to volatile market conditions. These market conditions often are affected by factors beyond the ethanol plants’control, such as weather conditions, overall economic conditions, export market, governmental regulation and foreign and domestic relations,including, but not limited to, the impacts from the Russian-Ukraine conflict. Significant disruptions in the supply of natural gas couldimpair or completely prevent the ethanol plants’ ability to economically manufacture ethanol for their customers. Furthermore, increasesin natural gas prices may adversely affect results of operations and financial position at our ethanol plants. Fluctuations in the selling price of commoditiesmay reduce profit margins at our ethanol plants. Ethanol is marketed as a fuel additive to reducevehicle emissions from gasoline, as an octane enhancer to improve the octane rating of gasoline with which it is blended and, to a lesserextent, as a gasoline substitute. As a result, ethanol prices are influenced by the supply and demand for gasoline, and our ethanol plants’results of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected if gasoline demand decreases or the price of gasolinedeclines making ethanol less economical. 10Distillers grains compete with other protein-basedanimal feed products. The price of distillers grains may decrease when the prices of competing feed products decrease. The prices of competinganimal feed products are based in part on the prices of the commodities from which these products are made. Historically, sales pricesfor distillers grains have tracked along with the price of corn. However, there have been instances when the price increase for distillersgrains has lagged increases in corn prices. The production of distillers grains has increasedas a result of increases in dry mill ethanol production in the United States. This could lead to price declines in what we can sell ourdistillers grains for in the future. Such declines could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Pricing of distillers corn oil is primarily drivenby the demand from renewable diesel, biodiesel, and to some extent, sustainable aviation fuel markets. Distillers corn oil is marketedas a low-carbon feedstock to be used in these markets which may see expanded demand due to the extended blending tax credit, credits includedin the Inflation Reduction Act and growing Low Carbon Fuel Standard (“LCFS”) markets, resulting in an impact to distillerscorn oil demand. With a lower CI score, distillers corn oil may see improved pricing compared to heating oil and soybean oil, which ithas traditionally tracked closely in price. Alternatively, other feedstocks such as cooking oil and animal fats, with lower CI scoring,could be preferred over distillers corn oil. A decrease in the price of or demand for distillers corn oil could negatively impact ourresults of operations. Inflation could impact thecost and/or availability of material, labor and other input, which could adversely affect our operations. We have experienced inflationary impacts on keyproduction inputs, labor costs consisting of both wages and other labor-related costs, services, equipment and other inputs. These inflationarypressures could continue or worsen in future periods and may be beyond our control. We may not be able to pass these increased costs alongto our customers through the products we sell. As a result, inflation and higher prices could negatively impact our results of operations. Increased ethanol productionor decreases in demand for ethanol may result in excess production capacity in the ethanol industry, which may cause the price of ethanol,distillers grains and distillers corn oil to decrease. According to the RFA, domesticethanol production capacity is approximately 18.0 billion gallons per year. Under RFS II, there were mandated volumes through 2022 forconventional and advanced biofuels. After 2022, RFS volumes are to be determined by the EPA in coordination with the Secretaries of Energyand Agriculture. The EPA has set conventional renewable fuel volumes of 15.0 billion gallons for 2023 through 2025. In addition, for 2023they restored 250 million gallons previously waived. The implied excess capacity over the EPA proposed volumes could have an adverse effecton the results of our operations. In a manufacturing industry with excess capacity, producers have an incentive to manufacture additionalproducts for so long as the price exceeds the marginal cost of production (i.e., the cost of producing only the next unit, without regardfor interest, overhead or fixed costs). This incentive could result in the reduction of the market price of ethanol to a level that isinadequate to generate sufficient cash flow to cover costs. A decrease in demand for ethanolmay result in excess capacity, which could result from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, regulatory developments andreduced U.S. gasoline consumption. Reduced gasoline consumption could occur as a result of increased prices for gasoline or crude oil,which could cause businesses and consumers to reduce driving or acquire vehicles with more favorable gasoline mileage or acquire non-gasolinepowered vehicles. In addition, decreased overall economic activity could also lead to reduced gasoline consumption. 11In addition, because ethanolproduction produces distillers grains and distillers corn oil as by-products, increased ethanol production will also lead to increasedsupplies of distillers grains and distillers corn oil. An increase in the supply of distillers grains and distillers corn oil, withoutcorresponding increases in demand, could lead to lower prices or an inability to sell our ethanol plants’ distillers grains anddistillers corn oil production. A decline in the price of distillers grains or distillers corn oil could have a material adverse effecton the results of our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The price of ethanol and distillers grainsmay decline as a result of trade restrictions or duties on ethanol and distillers grains exports from the United States or from unfavorableforeign currency exchange rates. If the United States were to withdraw from ormaterially modify certain international trade agreements, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materiallyadversely affected. Ethanol and other products that we produce are sold into various other countries with trade agreements with the UnitedStates. If tariffs were raised on the foreign-sourced goods that lead to retaliatory actions, it could have material adverse effect onour business, financial condition and results of operations. The United States exported an estimated 1.4 billiongallons of ethanol in 2023, up from approximately 1.3 and approximately 1.2 billion gallons in 2022 and 2021, respectively. In 2023 and2022, an estimated 10.8 and 11.4 million metric tons, respectively, of distillers grains were exported, which represented approximately34% of U.S production each year. If producers and exporters of ethanol and distillers grains are subject to trade restrictions, or additionalduties are imposed on exports, it may make it uneconomical to export these products. The industry has experienced various trade policydisputes, tariffs and investigations in foreign countries that have adversely impacted the international demand for our products. Reducedinternational demand could lead to further oversupply and reduce pricing. Future demand for ethanol is uncertain andchanges in overall consumer demand for transportation fuel could affect demand. There are limited markets for ethanol other thanwhat is federally mandated. Increased consumer acceptance of E15 and E85 fuel is likely necessary in order for ethanol to achieve significantmarket share growth beyond federal mandate levels. Consumer demand for gasoline may be impacted byemerging transportation trends, such as hybrid and electric vehicles. Numerous automobile manufacturers have announced plans to phaseout internal combustion engine production by the mid-2030s. There also have been pledges to ban the sale of internal combustion enginesin countries such as Japan and the United Kingdom by 2035, as well as a statewide ban in California, which several states are imitating.If realized, these bans would accelerate the decline of liquid fuel demand and by extension demand for ethanol, biodiesel and renewablediesel. Recent federal legislation seeks to address the ever-increasing demand for electric vehicle infrastructure. Reduced demand forethanol could cause our results of operations to be materially impacted. We depend on our partners to operate certainof our ethanol investments. Our investments currently represent both majorityand minority equity positions. Day-to-day operating control of minority owned plants generally remains with the local investor group.We do not have the ability to directly modify the operations of these plants in response to changes in the business environment or inresponse to any deficiencies in local operations of the plants. In addition, local plant operators, who also represent the primary suppliersof corn and other crops to the plants, may have interests, such as the price and sourcing of corn and other crops, that may differ fromour interest, which is based solely on the operating profit of the plant. The 12limitations on our ability to control day-to-dayplant operations could adversely affect plant results of operations. We may not successfully acquire or developadditional ethanol investments. The growth of our ethanol businessdepends on our ability to identify and develop new ethanol investments. Any expansion strategy will depend on prevailing market conditionsfor the price of ethanol and the cost of corn and natural gas and the expectations of future market conditions. Additional financing mayalso be necessary to implement any expansion strategy, which may not be accessible or available on acceptable terms. In addition, failureto adequately manage the risks associated with additional ethanol investments could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may not successfully develop our plannedcarbon sequestration facility near the One Earth Energy ethanol plant. The Company has committed significant time andresources towards a carbon sequestration project near the One Earth Energy ethanol plant. The completion and start-up of this projectrequires numerous government and landowner approvals. If we are not successful in obtaining all these approvals, we may not be able tocomplete this project and could result in a significant write off of our commitments and investments. If we are not successful on this project, ourethanol plant could be at a disadvantage in the industry as our inability to sequester our carbon could result in a higher CI score thanour competitors if they are able to sequester their carbon. If we are unable to reduce our CI score, we may not be able to participatein the state and federal clean fuel programs, including federal tax credits outlined in the Inflation Reduction Act. Carbon capture and sequestration projects aresubject to federal, state, and local regulations. In addition to our planned carbon sequestrationfacility near our One Earth Energy ethanol plant, we have signed an agreement to deliver our carbon from the NuGen Energy facility toan outside party. These projects may not result in any realized benefit due to delays or suspended operations. Investments being madein these projects are based on regulatory guidelines, such as modeling for CI reductions, that may be adjusted outside of our controland could deviate from our current strategy. Federal guidelines within the IRA could be changed to no longer include corn-based ethanolfrom being eligible for certain tax incentives. Delays in the issuance or regulations or the elimination of clean fuel and other incentivesat the federal, state or local level could adversely affect our business. New legislation limiting our ability to sequestercarbon could be adopted at the federal, state or local levels. Our ethanol plants may be adversely affectedby technological advances and efforts to anticipate and employ such technological advances may prove unsuccessful. The development and implementation of new technologiesmay result in a significant reduction in the costs of ethanol production. For instance, any technological advances in the efficiency orcost to produce ethanol from inexpensive cellulosic sources such as corn stalk, wheat, oat or barley straw could have an adverse effecton our ethanol plants, because our plants are designed to produce ethanol from corn, which is, by comparison, a raw material with otherhigh value uses. We cannot predict when, or if, new technologies may become available, the rate of acceptance of new technologies by competitorsor the costs associated with new technologies. In addition, advances in the development of alternatives to ethanol could significantlyreduce demand for or eliminate the need for ethanol. 13Any advances in technology which require significantunanticipated capital expenditures to remain competitive or which reduce demand or prices for ethanol would have a material adverse effecton the results of our ethanol operations. In addition, alternative fuels, additives andoxygenates are continually under development. Alternative fuel additives that can replace ethanol may be developed, which may decreasethe demand for ethanol. It is also possible that technological advances in engine and exhaust system design and performance could reducethe use of oxygenates, which would lower the demand for ethanol. Reduced demand for ethanol could cause our results of operations to bematerially adversely affected. The U.S. ethanol industry is highly dependentupon a myriad of federal and state legislation and regulation and any changes in legislation or regulation could materially and adverselyaffect our results of operations and financial position. The renewable fuel standard program was authorizedunder the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and was expanded under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA). EISA increased theamount of renewable fuel required to be blended into gasoline with RFS II and required a minimum usage of corn-derived renewable fuelsof 12.0 billion gallons in 2010, increasing annually by 600 million gallons to 15.0 billion gallons in 2015 through 2022, with no specifiedvolume subsequent to 2022. After 2022, RFS volumes are to be determined by the EPA in coordination with the Secretaries of Energy andAgriculture. The EPA has the authority to assign the mandated amounts of renewable fuels to be blended into transportation fuel to individualfuel blenders. RFS II has been a primary factor in the growth of ethanol usage. Over the past several years various pieces of legislationhave been introduced to the U.S. Congress that were intended to reduce or eliminate ethanol blending requirements. To date, none of thebills have been successful but they are an indication of the continued effort to undermine the EISA. The EPA has set conventional renewable fuel volumesof 15.0 billion gallons for 2023 through 2025 Additionally, for 2023, the EPA restored 250 million gallons previously waived. Obligated parties use RINs to show compliancewith RFS-mandated volumes. RINs are attached to renewable fuels by producers and detached when the renewable fuel is blended with transportationfuel or traded in the open market. The market price of detached RINs affects the price of ethanol in certain markets and influences thepurchasing decisions by obligated parties. As a result of fluctuations in RINs pricing, certain obligated parties have petitioned theEPA and filed court actions to change the point of obligation or to seek relief from their obligation. The EPA granted 88 total SmallRefinery Exemptions (“SREs”) for 2016 through 2018 totaling approximately 4.3 billion gallons. In recent years, the EPA hadlargely denied small refiner waivers. However, on November 22, 2023, the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals (the “Court”)ruled against the EPA on six SREs the EPA had previously denied. The Court remanded those six petitions back to the EPA and each refinerywill continue to operate under temporary SREs granted to them by the Court. These and further SREs could lead to decreased RIN valuesand ethanol pricing. Flexible fuel vehicles (“FFVs”) receivepreferential treatment in meeting federally mandated corporate average fuel economy (“CAFE”) standards for automobiles manufacturedby car makers. High blend ethanol fuels such as E-85 result in lower fuel efficiencies. Absent the CAFE preferences, car makers wouldnot likely build flexible-fuel vehicles. In recent years, automobile manufactures have lowered the production of FFVs for the U.S. Anychange in CAFE preferences could reduce the growth of E-85 markets and result in lower ethanol prices. Unfavorable changes in legislation or regulationscould materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. 14The inability to generate or obtain RINs couldadversely affect our operating results. Virtually all our ethanol is sold with RINs thatare used by customers to comply with RFS II. If our production does not meet EPA requirements for RIN generation, as an efficient producer,in the future, we would have to purchase RINs in the open market or sell our ethanol at substantially lower prices, such as on the exportmarket, to adjust for the absence of RINs. The price of RINs varies based on many factors and cannot be predicted. Failure to obtain sufficientRINs or reliance on invalid RINs could subject us to fines and penalties imposed by the EPA. Various studies have criticized the efficiencyof ethanol, in general, and corn-based ethanol in particular, which could lead to the reduction or repeal of incentives and tariffs thatpromote the use and domestic production of ethanol or otherwise negatively impact public perception and acceptance of ethanol as an alternativefuel. Although many trade groups, academics and governmentalagencies have supported ethanol as a fuel additive that promotes a cleaner environment, others have criticized ethanol production as consumingconsiderably more energy and emitting more greenhouse gases than other biofuels and as potentially depleting water resources. Other studieshave suggested that corn-based ethanol negatively impacts consumers by causing prices to increase for dairy, meat and other foodstuffs. If these views gain acceptance, support for existingmeasures promoting use and domestic production of corn-based ethanol could decline, leading to reduction or repeal of these measures.These views could also negatively impact public perception of the ethanol industry and acceptance of ethanol as an alternative fuel. Federal support of cellulosic ethanol may resultin reduced incentives to corn-derived ethanol producers. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of2009 and EISA provide funding opportunities in support of cellulosic ethanol obtained from biomass sources such as switchgrass and poplartrees. These federal policies may suggest a long-term political preference for cellulosic processes using alternative feedstocks suchas switchgrass, silage or wood chips. Cellulosic ethanol has a smaller carbon footprint than corn-derived ethanol and is unlikely to divertfoodstuff from the market. Our plants are designed as single-feedstock facilities, located in corn production areas with limited alternativefeedstock nearby, and would require significant additional investment to convert to the production of cellulosic ethanol. The adoptionof cellulosic ethanol as the preferred form of ethanol could have a significant adverse effect on our ethanol business. Our ethanol business is affected by environmental and other regulationswhich could impede or prohibit our ability to successfully operate our plants. Our ethanol production facilities are subjectto extensive air, water discharge, and other environmental regulations. We have had to obtain numerous permits to construct and operateour plants. Regulatory agencies could impose conditions or other restrictions in the permits that are detrimental, or which increase ourcosts. More stringent federal or state environmental regulations could be adopted which could significantly increase our operating costsor require us to expend considerable resources. Our ethanol plants emit various airborne pollutantsas by-products of the ethanol production process, including carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas). In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court classifiedcarbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act in a case seeking to require the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide in vehicleemissions. In February 2010, the EPA released its final regulations on the Renewable Fuel Standard program. We believe our plants aregrandfathered up to certain operating capacity, but plant expansion requires us to 15meet a 20% threshold reduction in greenhouse gas(GHG) emissions from a 2005 baseline measurement to produce ethanol eligible for the RFS II mandate. To further expand our plant capacity,we may be required to obtain additional permits, install advanced technology equipment, or reduce drying of certain amounts of distillersgrains. We may also be required to install carbon dioxide mitigation equipment or take other steps in order to comply with future lawsor regulations. Compliance with future laws or regulations with respect to emissions of carbon dioxide, or if we choose to expand capacityat certain of our plants, compliance with then-current regulations of carbon dioxide, could be costly and may prevent us from operatingour plants at full capacity or as profitably, which may have a negative impact on our financial performance. We also face the risk ofethanol production above our grandfathered capacity not qualifying for RINs if the plants do not meet certain emission requirements. The California Air Resources Board (“CARB”)adopted a LCFS requiring a 10% reduction in GHG emissions from transportation fuels. An Indirect Land Use Charge is included in this lifecycleGHG emission calculation. This standard could have an adverse impact on the market for corn-based ethanol in California if corn-basedethanol fails to achieve lifecycle GHG emission reductions and in other states if they adopt similar standards. This could have a negativeimpact on our financial performance. Our ethanol business may become subject tovarious environmental and health and safety and property damage claims and liabilities. Operation of our ethanol business exposes thebusiness to the risk of environmental and health and safety claims and property damage claims, such as failure to comply with environmentalregulations. These types of claims could also be made against our ethanol business based upon the acts or omissions of other persons.Serious claims could have a material negative impact on our results of operations, financial position and future cash flows. Our business is not diversified. Our financial results depend heavily on our abilityto operate our ethanol plants profitably. Our lack of diversification could have a material negative impact on our results of operations,financial position and future cash flows should our ethanol plants operate unprofitably. We may not be able to meet commitments to produceand sell ethanol. We may, at times, sell our products with forwardcontracts. If we are unable to produce the products due to economic conditions, business interruption, or other factors, we may incuradditional costs or have to obtain commodities at unfavorable prices to meet our contractual commitments. This could have a material adverseeffect on our results of operations. We may not be able to meet commitments to purchasecommodities. We may, at times, purchase certain commoditieswith forward contracts without a corresponding quantity of ethanol sold via forward contracts at known prices. Should ethanol and by-productprices decline to levels that would lead to significant unprofitable results of operations, we may incur additional costs and/or lossesto meet our contractual commitments. This could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 16Our revenue from the sale of distillers grainsdepends upon its continued market acceptance as an animal feed. Distillers grains is a by-product from the fermentationof corn to produce ethanol. Antibiotics may be used during the fermentation process to control bacterial contamination; therefore, antibioticsmay be present in small quantities in distillers grains marketed as animal feed. The U. S. Food and Drug Administration’s Centerfor Veterinary Medicine has expressed concern about potential animal and human health hazards from the use of distillers grains as ananimal feed due to the possibility of antibiotic residues. If the public became concerned about the impact of distillers grains in thefood supply or as an acceptable animal feed, the market for distillers grains could be negatively impacted, which would have a negativeimpact on our results of operations. We may not be able to obtain a suitable replacement for antibiotics, should this be required, whichwould also negatively impact the market for distillers grains. An estimated 34% of distillers grains producedin the United States were exported in 2023. The price of distillers grains has benefitted from the exports of the product. In recent years,certain countries have refused to import U.S. distillers grains for a variety of reasons. If export shipments are rejected or delayed,the market price for distillers grains would be negatively impacted, which would have a negative impact on our ethanol results of operations. We extract distillers corn oil immediately priorto the production of distillers grains. Several studies are attempting to determine whether distillers corn oil extraction may impactthe nutritional value of the resulting distillers grains. If it is determined that distillers corn oil extraction adversely impacts thenutritional energy content of distillers grains, the value of the distillers grains we sell may be negatively impacted, which would havea negative impact on our results of operations. We face significant competitionin the ethanol industry. We face significant competitionfor new ethanol investment opportunities. Many of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources and name recognitionthan we do. We must compete for investment opportunities based on our strategy of supporting and enhancing local development of ethanolplant opportunities. We may not be successful in competing for investment opportunities based on our strategy. The ethanol industry is primarilycomprised of entities that engage exclusively in ethanol production and large integrated grain companies that produce ethanol along withtheir base grain business. Several large oil companies have entered the ethanol production market. If these companies increase their ethanolplant ownership or if other oil companies seek to engage in direct ethanol production, there would be less of a need to purchase ethanolfrom independent producers such as our ethanol plants. No assurance can be given that our ethanol plants will be able to compete successfullyor that competition from larger companies with greater financial resources will not have a materially adverse impact on the results ofour ethanol operations. We may face competition fromforeign producers. There is a risk of foreign competitionin the ethanol industry. Brazil is presently the second largest producer of ethanol in the world. Brazil’s ethanol production ismostly sugarcane based, and, depending on feedstock prices, may be cheaper to produce than corn-derived ethanol. Under the RFS, certainparties were obligated to meet an advanced biofuel standard. In recent years, sugarcane-based ethanol imported from Brazil has been oneof the most economical means for obligated parties to comply with this standard. If significant additional foreignethanol production capacity is created, such facilities could create excess supplies of ethanol, which may result in lower prices of ethanol.In addition, foreign ethanol producers may 17be able to produce ethanol atcosts lower than ours. These risks could have significant adverse effects on our financial performance. We are exposed to creditrisk from our sales of ethanol and distillers grains to customers. The inability of a customerto make payments to us for our accounts receivable may cause us to experience losses and may adversely impact our liquidity and our abilityto make our payments when due. We may not be able to hireand retain qualified personnel to operate our ethanol plants and carbon sequestration facility. Our ability to attract and retaincompetent personnel has a significant impact on operating efficiencies and plant profitability. Competition for key plant employees inthe ethanol industry can be intense, and there has been an increased demand for workers in the U.S. We may not be able to attract andretain qualified employees. Failure to do so could have a negative impact on our financial results at individual plants. Our plants depend on an uninterrupted supply of energy and waterto operate. Unforeseen plant shutdowns could harm our business. Our plants require a significant and uninterruptedsupply of natural gas, electricity and water to operate. We generally rely on third parties to provide these resources. If there is aninterruption in the supply of energy or water for any reason, such as supply, delivery or mechanical problems and we are unable to securean adequate alternative supply to sustain plant operations, we may be required to stop production. A production halt for an extended periodof time could result in material losses. We rely on information technology in our operationsand financial reporting and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security breach of that technology could harm our abilityto efficiently operate our business and report our financial results accurately and timely. We rely heavily on information technology systemsacross our operations, including for management of inventory, purchase orders, production, invoices, shipping, accounting and variousother processes and transactions. Our ability to effectively manage our business, coordinate the production, distribution and sale ofour products and ensure the timely and accurate recording and disclosure of financial information depends significantly on the reliabilityand capacity of these systems. While we have taken appropriate precautions to protect our systems, and to date, we have not experiencedany material adverse events related to a security breach or cyber-attack, the failure of these systems to operate effectively, problemswith transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems through a cyber-attack or otherwise couldcause delays and/or interruptions in plant operations, product sales, reduced efficiency of our operations and delays in reporting ourfinancial results. Significant capital investments could be required to remediate any such problem. Security breaches of employee informationor other confidential or proprietary data could also adversely impact our reputation and could result in litigation against us or theimposition of penalties. We are exposed to potential business disruptionfrom factors outside our control, including natural disasters, severe weather conditions, accidents, pandemic diseases, internationaldisputes, and unforeseen operational failures any of which could negatively affect our transportation operations and could adversely affectour cash flows and operating results. Potential business disruption in available transportationdue to natural disasters, severe weather conditions, the outbreak of a pandemic disease, significant track damage resulting from a trainderailment, strikes or other interruptions by our transportation providers could result in delays in procuring and supplying raw materials 18to our ethanol facilities, or transporting ethanoland distillers grains to our customers. Such business disruptions may result in our inability to meet customer demand or contract deliveryrequirements, as well as the potential loss of customers. We ship much of our products and receive aportion of our corn via rail, which involves risks involving potential regulatory changes that could adversely affect our cash flows andoperating results. A large portion of our ethanol and distillersgrains sales are shipped via rail. In addition, we receive some corn via rail. Given the notoriety of recent major train derailments,it is possible that additional regulations could be enacted. Any changes to existing laws and regulations, or new laws and regulations,including voluntary measures taken by the rail industry, could result in higher shipping costs, or new requirements for the design, constructionor operation of tank cars that transport hazard materials, such as ethanol. In addition, any derailments involving our products couldresult in legal claims being brought against us that could involve significant liabilities. We operate in a capital intensive industry.Limitations on external financing could adversely affect our financial performance. We may need to incur additional financing to fundgrowth of our business or in times of increasing liquidity requirements (such as increases in raw material costs). Bankruptcy filingsby several ethanol companies in past years and capital market volatility has reduced available capital for the ethanol industry. Any delaysin obtaining additional financing, or our inability to do so, could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. During the early months of 2020, a new strainof COVID-19 spread into the United States and other countries. In an effort to contain the spread of this virus,there were various government mandated restrictions, in addition to voluntary privately implemented restrictions, including limiting publicgatherings, retail store closures, restrictions on employees working and the quarantining of people who may have been exposed to the virus.The above actions led to reduced demand for ethanol. If in the future, this or other viruses surface, it could lead to prolonged productionstoppages at our ethanol plants and could result in an adverse material impact on the results of operations and on our financial position.We idled our NuGen and One Earth ethanol plants for portions of fiscal year 2020, largely due to the impact of the pandemic. Risks Related to our Refined Coal Operations We believe our refined coal production companyqualified to earn tax credits under IRC Section 45 through November 18, 2021. Our ability to avoid write-offs in connection with thisinvestment is subject to various risks and uncertainties. These include, but are not limited to, the risks and uncertainties as set forthbelow. Availability of the tax credits under IRC Section 45. Our ability to claim tax credits under IRC Section45 depends upon our refined coal operation satisfying certain conditions set forth in IRC Section 45. The IRS could ultimately determinethat our refined coal facility and/or its operations did not satisfy the conditions set forth in IRC Section 45. This operation is currentlyunder audit by the IRS and if we were to lose these tax credits, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 19Our refined coal operation and its by-products may result in environmentaland product liability claims and environmental compliance costs. The construction and operation of refined coaloperations were subject to Federal, state and local laws, regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protectionor preservation of the environment, natural resources and human health and safety. Such laws and regulations generally require the operationsand/or the utilities at which the operations are located to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations, licenses, permits,inspections and other approvals. Such laws and regulations also impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of a party’sconduct, on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to, or are otherwise involved in, the release or threatened releaseof hazardous substances into the environment. Such risk remains even after production ceases at an operation to the extent the environmentaldamage can be traced to the types of chemicals or compounds used or operations conducted in connection with the use of refined coal. Our insurance may not cover all environmentalrisk and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of an environmental claim. If significant uninsured losses arise fromenvironmental damage or product liability claims, or if the costs of environmental compliance increase for any reason, our results ofoperations and financial condition could be adversely affected. We will have to generate taxable income toutilize the Section 45 federal production tax credits. If we do not generate sufficient taxable incometo utilize the tax credits earned by our refined coal operation, we could incur write-offs of the related tax attributes which could adverselyaffect our results of operations and financial condition. We used patented technology. As part of the operations, we paid a license feefor patented technology. If our third-party operator is subject to patent infringement claims, we may incur legal fees to defend our positionand be subject to additional costs and fees. Risks Related to REX and General Risk Factors
 We have concentrations of cash deposits atfinancial institutions that exceed federal insurance limits. We generally have cash deposits that exceed federalinsurance limits. Should the financial institutions we deposit our cash in experience insolvency or other financial difficulty, our accessto cash deposits could be limited. In extreme cases, we could lose our cash deposits entirely. This would negatively impact our liquidityand results of operations. 20We may fail to realize the anticipated benefitsof mergers, acquisitions, or other investments. We intend to continue seeking growth opportunities.Acquisitions and similar transactions involve many risks that could harm our business, which include:●The anticipated benefits of these transactions may not be fully realized, or take longer to realize thanexpected,●Future acquisitions could result in operating losses or loss of investment,●Future acquisitions may involve incurring debt to complete these transactions, which could have a materialadverse effect on our financial condition,●Future acquisitions may require us to invest a significant portion of our excess cash, which could havea material adverse effect on our financial condition, and●Our carbon sequestration investment may not be successful. Rising focus on environmental, social and corporategovernance matters from investors and regulators may increase our operating costs, bring down the value of our products and assets, andimpact our ability to access capital markets. Global climate change continues to receive significantattention from the public and the scientific community concerning the impacts from human activity, particularly the impact of greenhousegas emissions, such as those from carbon dioxide and methane. The current federal administration’s focus on environmental issueshas added pressure to take action domestically where there was already a heavier focus internationally. International, national, and localregulations are likely to increase in the coming years. Added requirements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may increase our productioncosts. In addition, legislation promoting alternatives to combustion engine vehicles could reduce the demand for our products. Climate change is also thought by some to be thecause for an increase in extreme weather events such as increased intensity of storms, rising sea levels, as well as heavy rains or droughtsin areas historically less prone to those events. Any of these events can have a significant impact on our operations or quality of rawmaterials we purchase, resulting in increased costs. At this time, we are unable to determine the financial impact of any potential adverseweather events caused by climate change. Incremental to legislative and regulatory pressure,institutional investors have continued to adopt environmental, social and governance guidelines (ESG). Some investors, including certainpublic and private fund management firms, pension funds, university endowments and family offices, have in recent years, begun addingstated policies to reduce or eliminate fossil fuel equities and encouraging additional consideration of ESG practices in a manner thatcould negatively impact our stock price. This may also result in a reduction of available capital funding for potential development projects,further impacting our future financial results. Federal, state and local jurisdictions maychallenge our tax return positions. We use significant judgments, estimates and interpretationand application of complex tax laws in preparing the tax returns we file, and the positions contained therein. We believe that our taxreturn positions are fully supportable. However, certain positions may be successfully challenged by federal, state and local jurisdictions.We are currently undergoing a federal income examination related to tax credits claimed for the years ended January 31, 2015 through 2022.This could result in material additional income tax payments we would have to make and higher income tax expense in future periods. "
0,REX,REX AMERICAN RESOURCES CORP,2023-03-30,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
  We encourage you to carefully consider the risksdescribed below and other information contained in this report when considering an investment decision in REX common stock. Any of theevents discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If one or more of these events do occur, our results of operations, financial conditionor cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In this instance, the trading price of REX stock could decline, and investors mightlose all or part of their investment. Risks Related to our Ethanol and By-ProductsBusiness The ethanol industry is changing rapidly whichcould result in unexpected developments that could negatively impact our operations. According to the RFA, the ethanol industry grewfrom approximately 1.5 billion gallons of domestic annual ethanol production in 1999 to a peak of approximately 16.1 billion gallons in2018. In 2022 and 2021, the industry produced approximately 15.4 and 15.0 billion gallons, respectively, with the reduction from the peakyear reflecting industry conditions and reduced demand. Thus, there have been significant changes in the supply and demand of ethanolover a relatively short period of time which could lead to difficulty in maintaining profitable operations at our ethanol plants. The financial returns on our ethanol investmentsare highly dependent on commodity prices, which are subject to significant volatility, uncertainty and regional supply shortages, so ourresults could fluctuate substantially. The financial returns on ourethanol investments are highly dependent on commodity prices, especially prices for corn, natural gas, ethanol, dried distillers grains,non-food grade corn oil and unleaded gasoline. As a result of the volatility of the prices for these items, our returns may fluctuatesubstantially and our investments could experience periods of declining prices for their products and increasing costs for their raw materials,which could result in operating losses at our ethanol plants. Our returns on ethanolinvestments are highly sensitive to grain prices.  Corn is the principal raw materialour ethanol plants use to produce ethanol and by-products. As a result, changes in the price of corn can significantly affect our businesses.Rising corn prices result in higher production costs of ethanol and by-products. Because ethanol competes with non-corn-based fuels, ourethanol plants may not be able to pass along increased grain costs to our customers. At certain levels, grain prices may make ethanoluneconomical to produce. The price of corn is influencedby weather conditions and other factors affecting crop yields, transportation costs, farmer planting decisions, exports, foreign production,the value of the U.S. dollar, and general domestic and foreign economic, market and regulatory factors, including, but not limited to,the impacts from the Russian-Ukraine conflict. These factors include government policies and subsidies with respect to agriculture andinternational trade and global and local demand and supply. The significance and relative effect of these factors on the price of cornis difficult to predict. Any event that tends to negatively affect the production and/or supply of corn, such as adverse weather or cropdisease, could increase corn prices and potentially harm the business of our ethanol plants, to include intermittent production slowdownsor stoppages. Increasing domestic ethanol production could boost the demand for corn and result in increased corn prices. Internationaldemand for corn could also result in higher corn prices. Our ethanol plants may also have difficulty, from time to time, in physicallysourcing corn on economic terms due to regional supply shortages, transportation issues, delays in farmer marketing decisions or unfavorablelocal pricing. The corn harvest near our NuGen facility 9for 2022 was negatively impacted by dry weather and we expect will impact thesupply of corn until the 2023 harvest. Such a shortage or price impact could require our ethanol plants to suspend operations which wouldhave a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. The spread between ethanoland corn prices can vary significantly. The gross margin at our ethanolplants depends principally on the spread between ethanol and corn prices. Fluctuations in the spread are likely to continue to occur.A sustained narrow or negative spread, whether as a result of sustained high or increased corn prices or sustained low or decreased ethanolprices, would adversely affect the results of operations at our ethanol plants. Our risk management strategiesmay be ineffective and may expose us to decreased profitability and liquidity. In an attempt to partially offsetthe impact of volatility of commodity prices, we enter into: i) forward contracts to sell a portion of our ethanol, distillers grains,and non-food grade corn oil production and to purchase a portion of our corn and natural gas requirements and; ii) commodity futures andswap agreements. The financial impact of these risk management activities is dependent upon, among other items, the prices involved andour ability to receive or deliver the commodities involved. Risk management activities can result in financial loss when positions arepurchased in a declining market or when positions are sold in an increasing market. In addition, we may not be able to match the appropriatequantity of corn contracts with quantities of ethanol, distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil contracts. Further, ourresults may be impacted by a mismatch of gains or losses associated with the positions during a reporting period when the physical commoditypurchase or sale has not yet occurred. We vary the amount and type of risk management techniques we utilize, and we may choosenot to engage in any risk management activities. Should we fail to properly manage the inherent volatility of commodity prices, our resultsof operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. The market for naturalgas is subject to market conditions that create uncertainty in the price and availability of the natural gas that our ethanol plants usein their manufacturing process.  Our ethanol plants rely uponthird parties for their supply of natural gas, which is consumed as fuel in the production process. The prices for and availability ofnatural gas are subject to volatile market conditions. These market conditions often are affected by factors beyond the ethanol plants’control, such as weather conditions, overall economic conditions, governmental regulation and foreign and domestic relations, including,but not limited to, the impacts from the Russian-Ukraine conflict. Significant disruptions in the supply of natural gas could impair orcompletely prevent the ethanol plants’ ability to economically manufacture ethanol for their customers. Furthermore, increases innatural gas prices may adversely affect results of operations and financial position at our ethanol plants. Fluctuations in the selling price of commoditiesmay reduce profit margins at our ethanol plants. Ethanol is marketed as a fuel additive to reducevehicle emissions from gasoline, as an octane enhancer to improve the octane rating of gasoline with which it is blended and, to a lesserextent, as a gasoline substitute. As a result, ethanol prices are influenced by the supply and demand for gasoline, and our ethanol plants’results of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected if gasoline demand decreases or the price of gasolinedeclines making ethanol less economical. Distillers grains compete with other protein-basedanimal feed products. The price of distillers grains may decrease when the prices of competing feed products decrease. The prices of competinganimal feed products 10are based in part on the prices of the commodities from which these products are made. Historically, sales pricesfor distillers grains have tracked along with the price of corn. However, there have been instances when the price increase for distillersgrains has lagged increases in corn prices. The production of distillers grains has increasedas a result of increases in dry mill ethanol production in the United States. This could lead to price declines in what we can sell ourdistillers grains for in the future. Such declines could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Increased ethanol productionor decreases in demand for ethanol may result in excess production capacity in the ethanol industry, which may cause the price of ethanol,distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil to decrease.  According to the RFA, domesticethanol production capacity is approximately 17.9 billion gallons per year. Under RFS II, there were mandated volumes through 2022 forconventional and advanced biofuels. After 2022, RFS volumes are to be determined by the EPA in coordination with the Secretaries of Energyand Agriculture. The EPA has proposed conventional renewable fuel volumes of 15.0 billion gallons for 2023 and 15.25 billion gallons for2024 and 2025. In addition, the proposal for 2023 also restores the remaining 250 million gallons previously waived in 2016. The impliedexcess capacity over the EPA proposed volumes could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations. In a manufacturing industrywith excess capacity, producers have an incentive to manufacture additional products for so long as the price exceeds the marginal costof production (i.e., the cost of producing only the next unit, without regard for interest, overhead or fixed costs). This incentive couldresult in the reduction of the market price of ethanol to a level that is inadequate to generate sufficient cash flow to cover costs. Excess capacity may also resultfrom decreases in the demand for ethanol, which could result from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, regulatory developmentsand reduced U.S. gasoline consumption. Reduced gasoline consumption could occur as a result of increased prices for gasoline or crudeoil, which could cause businesses and consumers to reduce driving or acquire vehicles with more favorable gasoline mileage or acquirenon-gasoline powered vehicles. In addition, decreased overall economic activity could also lead to reduced gasoline consumption. In addition, because ethanolproduction produces distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil as by-products, increased ethanol production will also lead to increasedsupplies of distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil. An increase in the supply of distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil,without corresponding increases in demand, could lead to lower prices or an inability to sell our ethanol plants’ distillers grainsand non-food grade corn oil production. A decline in the price of distillers grains or non-food grade corn oil could have a material adverseeffect on the results of our ethanol operations. The price of ethanol and distillers grainsmay decline as a result of trade restrictions or duties on ethanol and distillers grains exports from the United States or from unfavorableforeign currency exchange rates. If the United States were to withdraw from ormaterially modify certain international trade agreements, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materiallyadversely affected. Ethanol and other products that we produce are sold into various other countries with trade agreements with the UnitedStates. If tariffs were raised on the foreign-sourced goods that lead to retaliatory actions, it could have material adverse effect onour business, financial condition and results of operations. The United States exported approximately 1.4 billiongallons of ethanol in 2022, up from approximately 1.2 and approximately 1.3 billion gallons in 2021 and 2020, respectively. In 2022 and2021, approximately 11.411 and 11.6 million metric tons, respectively, of distillers grains were exported, which represented approximately34% and 36%, respectively, of U.S production. If producers and exporters of ethanol and distillers grains are subject to trade restrictions,or additional duties are imposed on exports, it may make it uneconomical to export these products. The industry has experienced varioustrade policy disputes, tariffs and investigations in foreign countries that have adversely impacted the international demand for our products.Reduced international demand could lead to further oversupply and reduce pricing. Future demand for ethanol is uncertain andchanges in overall consumer demand for transportation fuel could affect demand. There are limited markets for ethanol other thanwhat is federally mandated. Increased consumer acceptance of E15 and E85 fuel is likely necessary in order for ethanol to achieve significantmarket share growth beyond federal mandate levels. Consumer demand for gasoline may be impacted byemerging transportation trends, such as electric vehicles. Most automobile manufacturers have made varying levels of commitments to phaseout internal combustion engine production, such as General Motors with a target date of 2035 to phase out the production of gasoline anddiesel-powered vehicles and Nissan targeting the early 2030s to convert their entire fleet to electric vehicles. There also have beenpledges to ban the sale of internal combustion engines in countries such as Japan and the United Kingdom by 2035, as well as a statewideban in California, which several states are imitating. If realized, these bans would accelerate the decline of liquid fuel demand andby extension demand for ethanol, biodiesel and renewable diesel. Recent federal legislation seeks to address the ever-increasing demandfor electric vehicle infrastructure. Reduced demand for ethanol could cause our results of operations to be materially impacted. We depend on our partners to operate certainof our ethanol investments. Our investments currently represent both majorityand minority equity positions. Day-to-day operating control of minority owned plants generally remains with the local investor group.We do not have the ability to directly modify the operations of these plants in response to changes in the business environment or inresponse to any deficiencies in local operations of the plants. In addition, local plant operators, who also represent the primary suppliersof corn and other crops to the plants, may have interests, such as the price and sourcing of corn and other crops, that may differ fromour interest, which is based solely on the operating profit of the plant. The limitations on our ability to control day-to-day plant operationscould adversely affect plant results of operations. We may not successfully acquire or developadditional ethanol investments. The growth of our ethanol businessdepends on our ability to identify and develop new ethanol investments. Our ethanol development strategy depends on referrals, and introductions,to new investment opportunities from industry participants, such as ethanol plant builders and owners, financial institutions, marketingagents and others. We must continue to maintain favorable relationships with these industry participants, and a material disruption inthese sources of referrals would adversely affect our ability to expand our ethanol investments. Any expansion strategy willdepend on prevailing market conditions for the price of ethanol and the cost of corn and natural gas and the expectations of future marketconditions. Additional financing may also be necessary to implement any expansion strategy, which may not be accessible or available onacceptable terms. In addition, failure to adequately manage the risks associated with additional ethanol investments could have a materialadverse effect on our business.12We may not successfully develop our plannedcarbon sequestration facility near the One Earth Energy ethanol plant. The Company has committed significant time andresources towards a carbon sequestration project near the One Earth Energy ethanol plant. The completion of this project requires numerousgovernment and landowner approvals. If we are not successful in obtaining all these approvals, we may not be able to complete this projectand could result in a write off of our commitments and investments. If we are not successful on this project, ourethanol plant could be at a disadvantage in the industry as our inability to sequester our carbon could result in a higher carbon intensity(CI) score than our competitors if they are able to sequester their carbon. If we are unable to reduce our CI score, we may not be ableto participate in the state and federal clean fuel programs, including federal tax credits outlined in the Inflation Reduction Act. Our ethanol plants may be adversely affectedby technological advances and efforts to anticipate and employ such technological advances may prove unsuccessful.  The development and implementation of new technologiesmay result in a significant reduction in the costs of ethanol production. For instance, any technological advances in the efficiency orcost to produce ethanol from inexpensive cellulosic sources such as corn stalk, wheat, oat or barley straw could have an adverse effecton our ethanol plants, because our plants are designed to produce ethanol from corn, which is, by comparison, a raw material with otherhigh value uses. We cannot predict when, or if, new technologies may become available, the rate of acceptance of new technologies by competitorsor the costs associated with new technologies. In addition, advances in the development of alternatives to ethanol could significantlyreduce demand for or eliminate the need for ethanol. Any advances in technology which require significantunanticipated capital expenditures to remain competitive or which reduce demand or prices for ethanol would have a material adverse effecton the results of our ethanol operations. In addition, alternative fuels, additives andoxygenates are continually under development. Alternative fuel additives that can replace ethanol may be developed, which may decreasethe demand for ethanol. It is also possible that technological advances in engine and exhaust system design and performance could reducethe use of oxygenates, which would lower the demand for ethanol. Reduced demand for ethanol could cause our results of operations to bematerially adversely affected. The U.S. ethanol industry is highly dependentupon a myriad of federal and state legislation and regulation and any changes in legislation or regulation could materially and adverselyaffect our results of operations and financial position. The renewable fuel standard program was authorizedunder the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and was expanded under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA). EISA increased theamount of renewable fuel required to be blended into gasoline with RFS II and required a minimum usage of corn-derived renewable fuelsof 12.0 billion gallons in 2010, increasing annually by 600 million gallons to 15.0 billion gallons in 2015 through 2022, with no specifiedvolume subsequent to 2022. After 2022, RFS volumes are to be determined by the EPA in coordination with the Secretaries of Energy andAgriculture. The EPA has the authority to assign the mandated amounts of renewable fuels to be blended into transportation fuel to individualfuel blenders. RFS II has been a primary factor in the growth of ethanol usage. Over the past several years various pieces of legislationhave been introduced to the U.S. Congress that were intended to reduce or eliminate ethanol 13blending requirements. To date, none of thebills have been successful but they are an indication of the continued effort to undermine the EISA. The EPA has proposed conventional renewable fuelvolumes of 15.0 billion gallons for 2023 and 15.25 billion gallons for both 2024 and 2025. Additionally, the proposal for 2023 also restoresthe remaining 250 million gallons previously waived in 2016. Obligated parties use RINs to show compliancewith RFS-mandated volumes. RINs are attached to renewable fuels by producers and detached when the renewable fuel is blended with transportationfuel or traded in the open market. The market price of detached RINs affects the price of ethanol in certain markets and influences thepurchasing decisions by obligated parties. As a result of fluctuations in RINs pricing, certain obligated parties have petitioned theEPA and filed court actions to change the point of obligation or to seek relief from their obligation. The EPA granted 88 total SmallRefinery Exemptions (“SREs”) for 2016 through 2018 totaling approximately 4.3 billion gallons. This action led to reducedvalues for RINs, and further action could decrease RIN values and ethanol pricing. In January 2020, the U.S Court of Appeals forthe 10th Circuit overturned the EPA’s granting of refinery exemptions to three refineries on two separate grounds. TheCourt ruled refineries are eligible for SREs only if such waivers are extensions of waivers granted in previous years. The refineriesdid not qualify for waivers in the year prior to the year the EPA granted them. The Court also stated the disproportionate economic hardshipof SREs should be based solely on whether compliance with RFS II creates such hardship, not whether compliance and other issues createthe hardship. Two of the refiners appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, and on January 25, 2021, the Supreme Court partiallyruled in favor of the small refiners, but only as to the interpretation of “extension” of a waiver. Flexible fuel vehicles (“FFVs”) receivepreferential treatment in meeting federally mandated corporate average fuel economy (“CAFE”) standards for automobiles manufacturedby car makers. High blend ethanol fuels such as E-85 result in lower fuel efficiencies. Absent the CAFE preferences, car makers wouldnot likely build flexible-fuel vehicles. In recent years, automobile manufactures have backtracked in the production of FFVs for the U.S.Any change in CAFE preferences could reduce the growth of E-85 markets and result in lower ethanol prices. Unfavorable changes in legislation or regulationscould materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. The inability to generate or obtain RINs couldadversely affect our operating results.  Virtually all our ethanol is sold with RINs thatare used by customers to comply with RFS II. If our production does not meet EPA requirements for RIN generation, as an efficient producer,in the future, we would have to purchase RINs in the open market or sell our ethanol at substantially lower prices to adjust for the absenceof RINs. The price of RINs varies based on many factors and cannot be predicted. Failure to obtain sufficient RINs or reliance on invalidRINs could subject us to fines and penalties imposed by the EPA. Various studies have criticized the efficiencyof ethanol, in general, and corn-based ethanol in particular, which could lead to the reduction or repeal of incentives and tariffs thatpromote the use and domestic production of ethanol or otherwise negatively impact public perception and acceptance of ethanol as an alternativefuel.  Although many trade groups, academics and governmentalagencies have supported ethanol as a fuel additive that promotes a cleaner environment, others have criticized ethanol production as consumingconsiderably 14more energy and emitting more greenhouse gases than other biofuels and as potentially depleting water resources. Other studieshave suggested that corn-based ethanol negatively impacts consumers by causing prices to increase for dairy, meat and other foodstuffs. If these views gain acceptance, support for existingmeasures promoting use and domestic production of corn-based ethanol could decline, leading to reduction or repeal of these measures.These views could also negatively impact public perception of the ethanol industry and acceptance of ethanol as an alternative fuel. Federal support of cellulosic ethanol may resultin reduced incentives to corn-derived ethanol producers.  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of2009 and EISA provide funding opportunities in support of cellulosic ethanol obtained from biomass sources such as switchgrass and poplartrees. These federal policies may suggest a long-term political preference for cellulosic processes using alternative feedstocks suchas switchgrass, silage or wood chips. Cellulosic ethanol has a smaller carbon footprint than corn-derived ethanol and is unlikely to divertfoodstuff from the market. Our plants are designed as single-feedstock facilities, located in corn production areas with limited alternativefeedstock nearby, and would require significant additional investment to convert to the production of cellulosic ethanol. The adoptionof cellulosic ethanol as the preferred form of ethanol could have a significant adverse effect on our ethanol business. Our ethanol business is affected by environmental and other regulationswhich could impede or prohibit our ability to successfully operate our plants. Our ethanol production facilities are subjectto extensive air, water and other environmental regulations. We have had to obtain numerous permits to construct and operate our plants.Regulatory agencies could impose conditions or other restrictions in the permits that are detrimental, or which increase our costs. Morestringent federal or state environmental regulations could be adopted which could significantly increase our operating costs or requireus to expend considerable resources. Our ethanol plants emit various airborne pollutantsas by-products of the ethanol production process, including carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas). In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court classifiedcarbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act in a case seeking to require the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide in vehicleemissions. In February 2010, the EPA released its final regulations on the Renewable Fuel Standard program. We believe our plants aregrandfathered up to certain operating capacity, but plant expansion requires us to meet a 20% threshold reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG)emissions from a 2005 baseline measurement to produce ethanol eligible for the RFS II mandate. To further expand our plant capacity, wemay be required to obtain additional permits, install advanced technology equipment, or reduce drying of certain amounts of distillersgrains. We may also be required to install carbon dioxide mitigation equipment or take other steps in order to comply with future lawsor regulations. Compliance with future laws or regulations with respect to emissions of carbon dioxide, or if we choose to expand capacityat certain of our plants, compliance with then-current regulations of carbon dioxide, could be costly and may prevent us from operatingour plants as profitably, which may have a negative impact on our financial performance. We also face the risk of ethanol production aboveour grandfathered capacity not qualifying for RINs if the plants do not meet certain emission requirements. The California Air Resources Board (“CARB”)adopted a Low Carbon Fuel Standard (“LCFS”) requiring a 10% reduction in GHG emissions from transportation fuels. An IndirectLand Use Charge is included in this lifecycle GHG emission calculation. This standard could have an adverse impact on the market for corn-basedethanol in California if corn-based ethanol fails to achieve lifecycle GHG emission reductions and in other states if they adopt similarstandards. This could have a negative impact on our financial performance.15Our ethanol business may become subject tovarious environmental and health and safety and property damage claims and liabilities.  Operation of our ethanol business exposes thebusiness to the risk of environmental and health and safety claims and property damage claims, such as failure to comply with environmentalregulations. These types of claims could also be made against our ethanol business based upon the acts or omissions of other persons.Serious claims could have a material negative impact on our results of operations, financial position and future cash flows. During the early months of 2020, a new strainof COVID-19 spread into the United States and other countries. In an effort to contain the spread of this virus,there were various government mandated restrictions, in addition to voluntary privately implemented restrictions, including limiting publicgatherings, retail store closures, restrictions on employees working and the quarantining of people who may have been exposed to the virus.The above actions led to reduced demand for ethanol. Although most restrictions have been lifted, if in the future the virus continuesto mutate or other viruses surface, it could lead to prolonged production stoppages at our ethanol plants and could result in an adversematerial impact on the results of operations and on our financial position. We idled our NuGen and One Earth ethanol plants for portionsof fiscal year 2020, largely due to the impact of the pandemic. Our business is not diversified.  Our financial results depend heavily on our abilityto operate our ethanol plants profitably. Our lack of diversification could have a material negative impact on our results of operations,financial position and future cash flows should our ethanol plants operate unprofitably. We may not be able to meet commitments to produceand sell ethanol. We may, at times, sell our products with forwardcontracts. If we are unable to produce the products due to economic conditions, business interruption, or other factors, we may incuradditional costs or have to obtain commodities at unfavorable prices to meet our contractual commitments. This could have a material adverseeffect on our results of operations. We may not be able to meet commitments to purchasecommodities. We may, at times, purchase certain commoditieswith forward contracts without a corresponding quantity of ethanol sold via forward contracts at known prices. Should ethanol and by-productprices decline to levels that would lead to significant unprofitable results of operations, we may incur additional costs and/or lossesto meet our contractual commitments. This could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our revenue from the sale of distillers grainsdepends upon its continued market acceptance as an animal feed. Distillers grains is a by-product from the fermentationof corn to produce ethanol. Antibiotics may be used during the fermentation process to control bacterial contamination; therefore, antibioticsmay be present in small quantities in distillers grains marketed as animal feed. The U. S. Food and Drug Administration’s Centerfor Veterinary Medicine has expressed concern about potential animal and human health hazards from the use of distillers grains as ananimal feed due to the possibility of antibiotic residues. If the public became concerned16 about the impact of distillers grains in thefood supply or as an acceptable animal feed, the market for distillers grains could be negatively impacted, which would have a negativeimpact on our results of operations. We may not be able to obtain a suitable replacement for antibiotics, should this be required, whichwould also negatively impact the market for distillers grains. An estimated 34% of distillers grains producedin the United States were exported in 2022. The price of distillers grains has benefitted from the exports of the product. In recent years,certain countries have refused to import U.S. distillers grains for a variety of reasons. If export shipments are rejected or delayed,the market price for distillers grains would be negatively impacted, which would have a negative impact on our ethanol results of operations. We extract non-food grade corn oil immediatelyprior to the production of distillers grains. Several studies are attempting to determine whether non-food grade corn oil extraction mayimpact the nutritional value of the resulting distillers grains. If it is determined that non-food grade corn oil extraction adverselyimpacts the nutritional energy content of distillers grains, the value of the distillers grains we sell may be negatively impacted, whichwould have a negative impact on our results of operations. We face significant competitionin the ethanol industry. We face significant competitionfor new ethanol investment opportunities. Many of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources and name recognitionthan we do. We must compete for investment opportunities based on our strategy of supporting and enhancing local development of ethanolplant opportunities. We may not be successful in competing for investment opportunities based on our strategy. The ethanol industry is primarilycomprised of entities that engage exclusively in ethanol production and large integrated grain companies that produce ethanol along withtheir base grain business. Several large oil companies have entered the ethanol production market. If these companies increase their ethanolplant ownership or if other oil companies seek to engage in direct ethanol production, there would be less of a need to purchase ethanolfrom independent producers such as our ethanol plants. No assurance can be given that our ethanol plants will be able to compete successfullyor that competition from larger companies with greater financial resources will not have a materially adverse impact on the results ofour ethanol operations. We may face competition fromforeign producers. There is a risk of foreign competitionin the ethanol industry. Brazil is presently the second largest producer of ethanol in the world. Brazil’s ethanol production is sugarcanebased, and, depending on feedstock prices, may be cheaper to produce than corn-derived ethanol. Under the RFS, certain parties were obligatedto meet an advanced biofuel standard. In recent years, sugarcane-based ethanol imported from Brazil has been one of the most economicalmeans for obligated parties to comply with this standard. If significant additional foreignethanol production capacity is created, such facilities could create excess supplies of ethanol, which may result in lower prices of ethanol.In addition, foreign ethanol producers may be able to produce ethanol at costs lower than ours. These risks could have significant adverseeffects on our financial performance. We are exposed to creditrisk from our sales of ethanol and distillers grains to customers. The inability of a customerto make payments to us for our accounts receivable may cause us to experience losses and may adversely impact our liquidity and our abilityto make our payments when due.17We may not be able to hireand retain qualified personnel to operate our ethanol plants. Our ability to attract and retaincompetent personnel has a significant impact on operating efficiencies and plant profitability. Competition for key plant employees inthe ethanol industry can be intense, and there has been an increased demand for workers in the U.S. We may not be able to attract andretain qualified employees. Failure to do so could have a negative impact on our financial results at individual plants. Our plants depend on an uninterrupted supply of energy and waterto operate. Unforeseen plant shutdowns could harm our business. Our plants require a significant and uninterruptedsupply of natural gas, electricity and water to operate. We generally rely on third parties to provide these resources. If there is aninterruption in the supply of energy or water for any reason, such as supply, delivery or mechanical problems and we are unable to securean adequate alternative supply to sustain plant operations, we may be required to stop production. A production halt for an extended periodof time could result in material losses. We rely on information technology in our operationsand financial reporting and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security breach of that technology could harm our abilityto efficiently operate our business and report our financial results accurately and timely. We rely heavily on information technology systemsacross our operations, including for management of inventory, purchase orders, production, invoices, shipping, accounting and variousother processes and transactions. Our ability to effectively manage our business, coordinate the production, distribution and sale ofour products and ensure the timely and accurate recording and disclosure of financial information depends significantly on the reliabilityand capacity of these systems. While we have taken appropriate precautions to protect our systems, and to date, we have not experiencedany material adverse events related to a security breach or cyber-attack, the failure of these systems to operate effectively, problemswith transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems through a cyber-attack or otherwise couldcause delays and/or interruptions in plant operations, product sales, reduced efficiency of our operations and delays in reporting ourfinancial results. Significant capital investments could be required to remediate any such problem. Security breaches of employee informationor other confidential or proprietary data could also adversely impact our reputation and could result in litigation against us or theimposition of penalties. We are exposed to potential business disruptionfrom factors outside our control, including natural disasters, severe weather conditions, accidents, pandemic diseases, internationaldisputes, and unforeseen operational failures any of which could negatively affect our transportation operations and could adversely affectour cash flows and operating results. Potential business disruption in available transportationdue to natural disasters, severe weather conditions, the outbreak of a pandemic disease, significant track damage resulting from a trainderailment, strikes or other interruptions by our transportation providers could result in delays in procuring and supplying raw materialsto our ethanol facilities, or transporting ethanol and distillers grains to our customers. Such business disruptions may result in ourinability to meet customer demand or contract delivery requirements, as well as the potential loss of customers.18We ship much of our products and receive aportion of our corn via rail, which involves risks involving potential regulatory changes that could adversely affect our cash flows andoperating results. A large portion of our ethanol and distillersgrains sales are shipped via rail. In addition, we receive some corn via rail. Given the notoriety of recent major train derailments,it is possible that additional regulations could be enacted. Any changes to existing laws and regulations, or new laws and regulations,including voluntary measures taken by the rail industry, could result in higher shipping costs, or new requirements for the design, constructionor operation of tank cars that transport hazard materials, such as ethanol. In addition, any derailments involving our products couldresult in legal claims being brought against us that could involve significant liabilities. We operate in a capital intensive industry.Limitations on external financing could adversely affect our financial performance. We may need to incur additional financing to fundgrowth of our business or in times of increasing liquidity requirements (such as increases in raw material costs). Bankruptcy filingsby several ethanol companies in past years and capital market volatility has reduced available capital for the ethanol industry. Any delaysin obtaining additional financing, or our inability to do so, could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. Risks Related to our Refined Coal Operations We believe our refined coal production companyqualified to earn tax credits under IRC Section 45 through November 18, 2021. Our ability to generate returns and avoid write-offs inconnection with this investment is subject to various risks and uncertainties. These include, but are not limited to, the risks and uncertaintiesas set forth below. Availability of the tax credits under IRC Section 45. Our ability to claim tax credits under IRC Section45 depends upon our refined coal operation satisfying certain conditions set forth in IRC Section 45. The IRS could ultimately determinethat our refined coal facility and/or its operations did not satisfy the conditions set forth in IRC Section 45. This operation is currentlyunder audit by the IRS and if we were to lose these tax credits, it could have a material impact on our results of operations. Our refined coal operation and its by-products may result in environmentaland product liability claims and environmental compliance costs. The construction and operation of refined coaloperations were subject to Federal, state and local laws, regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protectionor preservation of the environment, natural resources and human health and safety. Such laws and regulations generally require the operationsand/or the utilities at which the operations are located to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations, licenses, permits,inspections and other approvals. Such laws and regulations also impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of a party’sconduct, on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to, or are otherwise involved in, the release or threatened releaseof hazardous substances into the environment. Such hazardous substances could be released as a result of burning refined coal in a numberof ways, including air emissions, wastewater, and by-products such as fly ash. One party may, under certain circumstances, be requiredto bear more than its share or the entire share of investigation and cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtainedfrom other responsible parties. We may be exposed to the risk of becoming liable for environmental damage we may have had little, if any,involvement in creating. Such risk remains even after production ceases at an operation to the extent the 19environmental damage can betraced to the types of chemicals or compounds used or operations conducted in connection with the use of refined coal. No assurances can be given thatcontractual arrangements and precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators willresult in that facility owner or operator accepting full responsibility for any environmental damage. It is also not uncommonfor private claims by third parties alleging contamination to also include claims for personal injury, property damage,diminution of property or similar claims. Furthermore, many environmental, health and safety laws authorize citizen suits,permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits and force compliance. Our insurance may not coverall environmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of an environmental claim. Ifsignificant uninsured losses arise from environmental damage or product liability claims, or if the costs of environmentalcompliance increase for any reason, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. We will have to generate taxable income toutilize the Section 45 federal production tax credits. If we do not generate sufficient taxable incometo utilize the tax credits earned by our refined coal operation, we could incur write-offs of the related tax attributes which could adverselyaffect our results of operations and financial condition. We used patented technology. As part of the operations, we paid a license feefor patented technology. If our third-party operator is subject to patent infringement claims, we may incur legal fees to defend our positionand be subject to additional costs and fees. Risks Related to REX and General Risk Factors
 We have concentrations of cash deposits atfinancial institutions that exceed federal insurance limits.  We generally have cash deposits that exceed federalinsurance limits. Should the financial institutions we deposit our cash in experience insolvency or other financial difficulty, our accessto cash deposits could be limited. In extreme cases, we could lose our cash deposits entirely. This would negatively impact our liquidityand results of operations. We may fail to realize the anticipated benefitsof mergers, acquisitions, or other investments. We intend to continue seeking growth opportunities.Acquisitions and similar transactions involve many risks that could harm our business, which include: ●The anticipated benefits of these transactions may not be fully realized, or take longer to realize thanexpected,●Future acquisitions could result in operating losses or loss of investment,●Future acquisitions may involve incurring debt to complete these transactions, which could have a materialadverse effect on our financial condition, and●Future acquisitions may require us to invest a significant portion of our excess cash, which could havea material adverse effect on our financial condition. 20Rising focus on environmental, social and corporategovernance matters from investors and regulators may increase our operating costs, bring down the value of our products and assets, andimpact our ability to access capital markets. Global climate change continues to receive significantattention from the public and the scientific community concerning the impacts from human activity, particularly the impact of greenhousegas emissions, such as those from carbon dioxide and methane. The current federal administration’s focus on environmental issueshas added pressure to take action domestically where there was already a heavier focus internationally. International, national, and localregulations are likely to increase in the coming years. Added requirements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may increase our productioncosts. In addition, legislation promoting alternatives to combustion engine vehicles could reduce the demand for our products. Climate change is also thought by some to be thecause for an increase in extreme weather events such as increased intensity of storms, rising sea levels, as well as heavy rains or droughtsin areas historically less prone to those events. Any of these events can have a significant impact on our operations or quality of rawmaterials we purchase, resulting in increased costs. At this time, we are unable to determine the financial impact of any potential adverseweather events caused by climate change. Incremental to legislative and regulatory pressure,institutional investors have continued to adopt environmental, social and governance guidelines (ESG). Some investors, including certainpublic and private fund management firms, pension funds, university endowments and family offices, have in recent years, begun addingstated policies to reduce or eliminate fossil fuel equities and encouraging additional consideration of ESG practices in a manner thatcould negatively impact our stock price. This may also result in a reduction of available capital funding for potential development projects,further impacting our future financial results. Federal, state and local jurisdictions maychallenge our tax return positions. We use significant judgments, estimates and interpretationand application of complex tax laws in preparing the tax returns we file, and the positions contained therein. We believe that our taxreturn positions are fully supportable. However, certain positions may be successfully challenged by federal, state and local jurisdictions.We are currently undergoing a federal income examination related to tax credits claimed for the years ended January 31, 2015 through 2020.This could result in material additional income tax payments we would have to make and higher income tax expense in future periods. "
17,REX,REX AMERICAN RESOURCES CORP,2022-04-06,"Risk Factors
 We encourage you to carefully consider therisks described below and other information contained in this report when considering an investment decision in REX common stock.Any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If one or more of these events do occur, our results of operations,financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In this instance, the trading price of REX stock coulddecline, and investors might lose all or part of their investment. Risks Related to our Ethanol andBy-Products Business The ethanol industry is changing rapidlywhich could result in unexpected developments that could negatively impact our operations. According to the RFA, the ethanol industrygrew from approximately 1.5 billion gallons of domestic annual ethanol production in 1999 to a peak of approximately 16.1 billiongallons in 2018. In 2021 and 2020, the industry produced approximately 15.0 and 13.8 billion gallons, respectively, with the reductionfrom the peak year reflecting industry conditions. Thus, there have been significant changes in the supply and demand of ethanolover a relatively short period of time which could lead to difficulty in maintaining profitable operations at our ethanol plants. The financial returns on our ethanol investmentsare highly dependent on commodity prices, which are subject to significant volatility, uncertainty and regional supply shortages,so our results could fluctuate substantially. The financial returns onour ethanol investments are highly dependent on commodity prices, especially prices for corn, natural gas, ethanol, dried distillersgrains, non-food grade corn oil and unleaded gasoline. As a result of the volatility of the prices for these items, our returnsmay fluctuate substantially and our investments could experience periods of declining prices for their products and increasingcosts for their raw materials, which could result in operating losses at our ethanol plants. Our returns on ethanolinvestments are highly sensitive to grain prices. Corn is the principal rawmaterial our ethanol plants use to produce ethanol and by-products. As a result, changes in the price of corn can significantlyaffect our businesses. Rising corn prices result in higher production costs of ethanol and by-products. Because ethanol competeswith non-corn-based fuels, our ethanol plants may not be able to pass along increased grain costs to our customers. At certainlevels, grain prices may make ethanol uneconomical to produce. The price of corn is influencedby weather conditions and other factors affecting crop yields, transportation costs, farmer planting decisions, exports, foreignproduction, the value of the U.S. dollar, and general economic, market and regulatory factors. These factors include governmentpolicies and subsidies with respect to agriculture and international trade and global and local demand and supply. The significanceand relative effect of these factors on the price of corn is difficult to predict. Any event that tends to negatively affect theproduction and/or supply of corn, such as adverse weather or crop disease, could increase corn prices and potentially harm thebusiness of our ethanol plants, to include intermittent production slowdowns or stoppages.8Increasing domestic ethanolproduction could boost the demand for corn and result in increased corn prices. International demand for corn could also resultin higher corn prices. Our ethanol plants may also have difficulty, from time to time, in physically sourcing corn on economicterms due to regional supply shortages, transportation issues, delays in farmer marketing decisions or unfavorable local pricing.Such a shortage or price impact could require our ethanol plants to suspend operations which would have a material adverse effecton our consolidated results of operations. The spread betweenethanol and corn prices can vary significantly. The gross margin at ourethanol plants depends principally on the spread between ethanol and corn prices. Fluctuations in the spread are likely to continueto occur. A sustained narrow or negative spread, whether as a result of sustained high or increased corn prices or sustained lowor decreased ethanol prices, would adversely affect the results of operations at our ethanol plants. Our risk managementstrategies may be ineffective and may expose us to decreased profitability and liquidity. In an attempt to partiallyoffset the impact of volatility of commodity prices, we enter into: i) forward contracts to sell a portion of our ethanol anddistillers grains production and to purchase a portion of our corn and natural gas requirements and; ii) commodity futures andswap agreements. The financial impact of these risk management activities is dependent upon, among other items, the prices involvedand our ability to receive or deliver the commodities involved. Risk management activities can result in financial loss when positionsare purchased in a declining market or when positions are sold in an increasing market. In addition, we may not be able to matchthe appropriate quantity of corn contracts with quantities of ethanol, distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil contracts.Further, our results may be impacted by a mismatch of gains or losses associatedwith the positions during a reporting period when the physical commodity purchase or sale has not yet occurred. We varythe amount and type of risk management techniques we utilize, and we may choose not to engage in any risk management activities.Should we fail to properly manage the inherent volatility of commodity prices, our results of operations and financial conditionmay be adversely affected. The market for naturalgas is subject to market conditions that create uncertainty in the price and availability of the natural gas that our ethanolplants use in their manufacturing process.  Our ethanol plants relyupon third parties for their supply of natural gas, which is consumed as fuel in the production process. The prices for and availabilityof natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions. These market conditions often are affected by factors beyond the ethanolplants’ control, such as weather conditions, overall economic conditions, governmental regulation and foreign and domesticrelations. Significant disruptions in the supply of natural gas could impair or completely prevent the ethanol plants’ abilityto economically manufacture ethanol for their customers. Furthermore, increases in natural gas prices may adversely affect resultsof operations and financial position at our ethanol plants. Fluctuations in the selling price ofcommodities may reduce profit margins at our ethanol plants. Ethanol is marketed as a fuel additive toreduce vehicle emissions from gasoline, as an octane enhancer to improve the octane rating of gasoline with which it is blendedand, to a lesser extent, as a gasoline substitute. As a result, ethanol prices are influenced by the supply and demand for gasoline,and our ethanol plants’ results of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected if gasoline demanddecreases or the price of gasoline declines making ethanol less economical.9Distillers grains compete with other proteinbased animal feed products. The price of distillers grains may decrease when the prices of competing feed products decrease. Theprices of competing animal feed products are based in part on the prices of the commodities from which these products are made.Historically, sales prices for distillers grains have tracked along with the price of corn. However, there have been instanceswhen the price increase for distillers grains has lagged increases in corn prices. The production of distillers grains has increasedas a result of increases in dry mill ethanol production in the United States. This could lead to price declines in what we cansell our distillers grains for in the future. Such declines could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Increased ethanol productionor decreases in demand for ethanol may result in excess production capacity in the ethanol industry, which may cause the priceof ethanol, distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil to decrease.  According to the RFA, domesticethanol production capacity is approximately 17.7 billion gallons per year. On December 7, 2021, the EPA issued proposed RFS volumesfor 2021 and 2022 and reducing the previously finalized volumes for 2020 to account for challenges for that year including theCOVID-19 pandemic. The proposed volumes for conventional biofuels were 13.32 billion gallons and 15.0 billion gallons for 2021and 2022, respectively. The 2020 volumes were proposed at 12.5 billion gallons, down from the previously finalized 15.0 billiongallons. Excess capacity in the ethanol industry could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations. In a manufacturingindustry with excess capacity, producers have an incentive to manufacture additional products for so long as the price exceedsthe marginal cost of production (i.e., the cost of producing only the next unit, without regard for interest, overhead or fixedcosts). This incentive could result in the reduction of the market price of ethanol to a level that is inadequate to generatesufficient cash flow to cover costs. Excess capacity may alsoresult from decreases in the demand for ethanol, which could result from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, regulatorydevelopments and reduced U.S. gasoline consumption. Reduced gasoline consumption could occur as a result of increased prices forgasoline or crude oil, which could cause businesses and consumers to reduce driving or acquire vehicles with more favorable gasolinemileage or acquire non-gasoline powered vehicles. In addition, decreased overall economic activity could also lead to reducedgasoline consumption. In addition, because ethanolproduction produces distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil as by-products, increased ethanol production will also leadto increased supplies of distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil. An increase in the supply of distillers grains and non-foodgrade corn oil, without corresponding increases in demand, could lead to lower prices or an inability to sell our ethanol plants’distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil production. A decline in the price of distillers grains or non-food grade corn oilcould have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations. The price of ethanol and distillers grainsmay decline as a result of trade restrictions or duties on ethanol and distillers grains exports from the United States or fromunfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.  If the United States were to withdraw fromor materially modify certain international trade agreements, our business, financial condition and results of operations couldbe materially adversely affected. Ethanol and other products that we produce are sold into various other countries with tradeagreements with the United States. If tariffs were raised on the foreign-sourced goods that lead to retaliatory actions, it couldhave material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.10The United States exported approximately 1.2billion gallons of ethanol in 2021, down from approximately 1.3 and approximately 1.5 billion gallons in 2020 and 2019, respectively.If producers and exporters of ethanol are subject to trade restrictions, or additional duties are imposed on exports, it may makeit uneconomical to export ethanol. Brazil, China and the European Union all have trade barriers or tariffs against fuel ethanol.In 2013, the European Union imposed a five year tariff of $83.33 per metric ton on U.S. fuel ethanol to discourage competition.Effective January 1, 2017, China indicated its intention to raise its 5% tariff on U.S. and Brazil fuel ethanol to 30%. On April1, 2018, China raised their tariff rate to 45%, and later raised it to 70% in the U.S. and China trade war. On September 1, 2017,Brazil imposed a 20% tariff on U.S. fuel ethanol imports in excess of 150 million liters, or 39.6 million gallons per quarter.The tariff was extended several times but lapsed in December 2020 and a 20% tariff now applies to all U.S. ethanol exported toBrazil. This could result in an oversupply of ethanol in the United States, which could have a material adverse effect on theresults of our ethanol operations. In 2021, approximately 11.6 million metrictons of distillers grains were exported, which represented approximately 36% of U.S. production. However, the export market maybe jeopardized if foreign governments impose trade barriers or other measures to protect the foreign local markets. Exports toChina were approximately 4% of U.S. global shipments in 2021 versus approximately 51% in 2015, due to punitive tariffs establishedbeginning January 2017. If producers and exporters of distillers grains are subjected to trade barriers when selling distillersgrains to foreign customers, there may be a reduction in the price of distillers grains in the United States. In addition, foreigncurrency exchange rate fluctuations could reduce the demand for United States exports of distillers grains. Declines in the pricewe receive for our distillers grains could lead to decreased revenues and may result in our inability to operate our ethanol plantsprofitably. Future demand for ethanol is uncertainand changes in overall consumer demand for transportation fuel could affect demand. There are limited markets for ethanol otherthan what is federally mandated. Increased consumer acceptance of E15 and E85 fuel is likely necessary in order for ethanol toachieve significant market share growth beyond federal mandate levels. During the early months of 2020, a newstrain of COVID-19 spread into the United States and other countries. In an effort to contain the spread of thisvirus, there were various government mandated restrictions, in addition to voluntary privately implemented restrictions, includinglimiting public gatherings, retail store closures, restrictions on employees working and the quarantining of people who may havebeen exposed to the virus. The above actions led to reduced demand for ethanol. Although most restrictions have been lifted, ifin the future the virus continues to mutate, it could lead to prolonged production stoppages at our ethanol plants and could resultin an adverse material impact on the results of operations and on our financial position. We idled our NuGen and One Earth ethanolplants for portions of fiscal year 2020, largely due to the impact of the pandemic. We depend on our partners to operate certainof our ethanol investments. Our investments currently represent both majorityand minority equity positions. Day-to-day operating control of minority owned plants generally remains with the local investorgroup. We do not have the ability to directly modify the operations of these plants in response to changes in the business environmentor in response to any deficiencies in local operations of the plants. In addition, local plant operators, who also represent theprimary suppliers of corn and other crops to the plants, may have interests, such as the price and sourcing of corn and othercrops, that may differ from our interest, which is based solely on the operating profit of the plant. The limitations on our abilityto control day-to-day plant operations could adversely affect plant results of operations.11We may not successfully acquire or developadditional ethanol investments. The growth of our ethanolbusiness depends on our ability to identify and develop new ethanol investments. Our ethanol development strategy depends on referrals,and introductions, to new investment opportunities from industry participants, such as ethanol plant builders and owners, financialinstitutions, marketing agents and others. We must continue to maintain favorable relationships with these industry participants,and a material disruption in these sources of referrals would adversely affect our ability to expand our ethanol investments. Any expansion strategy willdepend on prevailing market conditions for the price of ethanol and the cost of corn and natural gas and the expectations of futuremarket conditions. Additional financing may also be necessary to implement any expansion strategy, which may not be accessibleor available on acceptable terms. In addition, failure to adequately manage the risks associated with additional ethanol investmentscould have a material adverse effect on our business. Our ethanol plants may be adversely affectedby technological advances and efforts to anticipate and employ such technological advances may prove unsuccessful.  The development and implementation of newtechnologies may result in a significant reduction in the costs of ethanol production. For instance, any technological advancesin the efficiency or cost to produce ethanol from inexpensive cellulosic sources such as corn stalk, wheat, oat or barley strawcould have an adverse effect on our ethanol plants, because our plants are designed to produce ethanol from corn, which is, bycomparison, a raw material with other high value uses. We cannot predict when, or if, new technologies may become available, therate of acceptance of new technologies by competitors or the costs associated with new technologies. In addition, advances inthe development of alternatives to ethanol could significantly reduce demand for or eliminate the need for ethanol. Any advances in technology which require significantunanticipated capital expenditures to remain competitive or which reduce demand or prices for ethanol would have a material adverseeffect on the results of our ethanol operations. In addition, alternative fuels, additivesand oxygenates are continually under development. Alternative fuel additives that can replace ethanol may be developed, whichmay decrease the demand for ethanol. It is also possible that technological advances in engine and exhaust system design and performancecould reduce the use of oxygenates, which would lower the demand for ethanol. Consumer demand for gasoline may be reduced by transportationrelated technological advances such as electric and hybrid vehicles. Several automobile manufacturers have announced target datesinto the 2030s for ceasing production of gasoline vehicles and shifting production to electric vehicles. In addition, countriessuch as Japan and the United Kingdom as well as the state of California have pledged to ban the sale of vehicles with internalcombustion engines over time. The Biden administration, in its early stages, appears to have placed an increased emphasis on electricvehicles. Recent federal legislation seeks to address the ever-increasing demand for electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure. OnNovember 15, 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) was signed into law. The IIJA specifically allocates $7.5billion specifically for EV infrastructure programs and grants on a national level. Reduced demand for ethanol could cause ourresults of operations to be materially adversely affected.12The U.S. ethanol industry is highly dependentupon a myriad of federal and state legislation and regulation and any changes in legislation or regulation could materially andadversely affect our results of operations and financial position. The renewable fuel standard program was authorizedunder the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and was expanded under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA). EISA increasedthe amount of renewable fuel required to be blended into gasoline with RFS II and required a minimum usage of corn-derived renewablefuels of 12.0 billion gallons in 2010, increasing annually by 600 million gallons to 15.0 billion gallons in 2015 through 2022,with no specified volume subsequent to 2022. After 2022, RFS volumes are to be determined by the EPA in coordination with theSecretaries of Energy and Agriculture. The EPA has the authority to assign the mandated amounts of renewable fuels to be blendedinto transportation fuel to individual fuel blenders. RFS II has been a primary factor in the growth of ethanol usage. Over thepast several years various pieces of legislation have been introduced to the U.S. Congress that were intended to reduce or eliminateethanol blending requirements. To date, none of the bills have been successful but they are an indication of the continued effortto undermine the EISA. Under EISA, the EPA has the authority to waiveor modify the mandated RFS II requirements in whole or in part. In order to grant a waiver, the EPA administrator must determinein consultation with the Secretaries of Agriculture and Energy, that one of the following two conditions has been met: i) thereis inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply or ii) implementation of the requirement would severely harm the economy or environmentof a state, region or the country. In certain past years the EPA has taken action to reduce the mandated gallons called for underEISA for both conventional and advanced renewable fuels. Obligated parties use RINs to show compliancewith RFS-mandated volumes. RINs are attached to renewable fuels by producers and detached when the renewable fuel is blended withtransportation fuel or traded in the open market. The market price of detached RINs affects the price of ethanol in certain marketsand influences the purchasing decisions by obligated parties. As a result of fluctuations in RINs pricing, certain obligated partieshave petitioned the EPA and filed court actions to change the point of obligation or to seek relief from their obligation. TheEPA granted 85 total SREs for 2016 through 2018 totaling approximately 4.0 billion gallons. This action led to reduced valuesfor RINs, and further action could decrease RIN values and ethanol pricing. In January 2020, the U.S Court of Appealsfor the 10th Circuit overturned the EPA’s granting of refinery exemptions to three refineries on two separategrounds. The Court ruled refineries are eligible for SREs only if such waivers are extensions of waivers granted in previous years.The refineries did not qualify for waivers in the year prior to the year the EPA granted them. The Court also stated the disproportionateeconomic hardship of SREs should be based solely on whether compliance with RFS II creates such hardship, not whether complianceand other issues create the hardship. Two of the refiners appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, and on January 25,2021, the Supreme Court partially ruled in favor of the small refiners, but only as to the interpretation of “extension”of a waiver. On December 7, 2021, the EPA issued proposedvolumes for 2021 and 2022 and reduced the previously finalized volumes for 2020 to account for challenges for that year includingthe COVID-19 pandemic. The proposed volumes for conventional biofuels were 13.32 billion gallons and 15.0 billion gallons for2021 and 2022, respectively. The 2020 volumes were proposed at 12.5 billion gallons, down from the previously finalized 15.0 billiongallons. In addition, the EPA proposed denying 65 pending applications for SREs in response to the 2020 decision by the U.S. Courtof Appeals for the 10th Circuit. The EPA also proposed adding 250 million gallons of “supplemental obligation”to the 2022 proposed volumes and stated its intent to add another 250 million gallons to 2023 to address the remand of the 2016waiver by the D.C Circuit. The EPA implemented a public notice and comment process on this announcement.13Flexible fuel vehicles receive preferentialtreatment in meeting federally mandated corporate average fuel economy (“CAFE”) standards for automobiles manufacturedby car makers. High blend ethanol fuels such as E-85 result in lower fuel efficiencies. Absent the CAFE preferences, car makerswould not likely build flexible-fuel vehicles. Any change in CAFE preferences could reduce the growth of E-85 markets and resultin lower ethanol prices. Unfavorable changes in legislation or regulationscould materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. The inability to generate or obtain RINscould adversely affect our operating results.  Virtually all of our ethanol is sold withRINs that are used by customers to comply with RFS II. If our production does not meet EPA requirements for RIN generation, asan efficient producer, in the future, we would have to purchase RINs in the open market or sell our ethanol at substantiallylower prices to adjust for the absence of RINs. The price of RINs varies based on many factors and cannot be predicted. Failureto obtain sufficient RINs or reliance on invalid RINs could subject us to fines and penalties imposed by the EPA. Various studies have criticized the efficiencyof ethanol, in general, and corn-based ethanol in particular, which could lead to the reduction or repeal of incentives and tariffsthat promote the use and domestic production of ethanol or otherwise negatively impact public perception and acceptance of ethanolas an alternative fuel.  Although many trade groups, academics andgovernmental agencies have supported ethanol as a fuel additive that promotes a cleaner environment, others have criticized ethanolproduction as consuming considerably more energy and emitting more greenhouse gases than other biofuels and as potentially depletingwater resources. Other studies have suggested that corn-based ethanol negatively impacts consumers by causing prices to increasefor dairy, meat and other foodstuffs. If these views gain acceptance, support forexisting measures promoting use and domestic production of corn-based ethanol could decline, leading to reduction or repeal ofthese measures. These views could also negatively impact public perception of the ethanol industry and acceptance of ethanol asan alternative fuel. Federal support of cellulosic ethanol mayresult in reduced incentives to corn-derived ethanol producers.  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Actof 2009 and EISA provide funding opportunities in support of cellulosic ethanol obtained from biomass sources such as switchgrassand poplar trees. These federal policies may suggest a long-term political preference for cellulosic processes using alternativefeedstocks such as switchgrass, silage or wood chips. Cellulosic ethanol has a smaller carbon footprint than corn-derived ethanoland is unlikely to divert foodstuff from the market. Our plants are designed as single-feedstock facilities, located in corn productionareas with limited alternative feedstock nearby, and would require significant additional investment to convert to the productionof cellulosic ethanol. The adoption of cellulosic ethanol as the preferred form of ethanol could have a significant adverse effecton our ethanol business. Our ethanol business is affected by environmental and otherregulations which could impede or prohibit our ability to successfully operate our plants. Our ethanol production facilities are subjectto extensive air, water and other environmental regulations. We have had to obtain numerous permits to construct and operate ourplants. Regulatory agencies could impose conditions or other restrictions in the permits that are detrimental, or which increaseour costs. More stringent14federal or state environmentalregulations could be adopted which could significantly increase our operating costs or require us to expend considerable resources. Our ethanol plants emit various airborne pollutantsas by-products of the ethanol production process, including carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas). In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Courtclassified carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act in a case seeking to require the EPA to regulate carbondioxide in vehicle emissions. In February 2010, the EPA released its final regulations on the Renewable Fuel Standard program.We believe our plants are grandfathered up to certain operating capacity, but recent plant expansion requires us to meet a 20%threshold reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from a 2005 baseline measurement to produce ethanol eligible for the RFSII mandate. To further expand our plant capacity, we may be required to obtain additional permits, install advanced technologyequipment, or reduce drying of certain amounts of distillers grains. We may also be required to install carbon dioxide mitigationequipment or take other steps in order to comply with future laws or regulations. Compliance with future laws or regulations withrespect to emissions of carbon dioxide, or if we choose to expand capacity at certain of our plants, compliance with then-currentregulations of carbon dioxide, could be costly and may prevent us from operating our plants as profitably, which may have a negativeimpact on our financial performance. We also face the risk of ethanol production above our grandfathered capacity not qualifyingfor RINs if the plants do not meet certain emission requirements. The California Air Resources Board (“CARB”)adopted a Low Carbon Fuel Standard (“LCFS”) requiring a 10% reduction in GHG emissions from transportation fuels. AnIndirect Land Use Charge is included in this lifecycle GHG emission calculation. This standard could have an adverse impact onthe market for corn-based ethanol in California if corn-based ethanol fails to achieve lifecycle GHG emission reductions and inother states if they adopt similar standards. This could have a negative impact on our financial performance. Our ethanol business may become subjectto various environmental and health and safety and property damage claims and liabilities.  Operation of our ethanol business exposesthe business to the risk of environmental and health and safety claims and property damage claims, such as failure to comply withenvironmental regulations. These types of claims could also be made against our ethanol business based upon the acts or omissionsof other persons. Serious claims could have a material negative impact on our results of operations, financial position and futurecash flows. Our business is not diversified.  Our financial results depend heavily on ourability to operate our ethanol plants profitably. Our lack of diversification could have a material negative impact on our resultsof operations, financial position and future cash flows should our ethanol plants operate unprofitably. We may have commitments to produce andsell ethanol. We may, at times, sell our products with forwardcontracts. If we are unable to produce the products due to economic conditions, business interruption, or other factors, we mayincur additional costs or have to obtain commodities at unfavorable prices to meet our contractual commitments. This could havea material adverse effect on our results of operations.15We may have commitments to purchase commodities. We may, at times, purchase certain commoditieswith forward contracts without a corresponding quantity of ethanol sold via forward contracts at known prices. Should ethanoland by-product prices decline to levels that would lead to significant unprofitable results of operations, we may incur additionalcosts and/or losses to meet our contractual commitments. This could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our revenue from the sale of distillersgrains depends upon its continued market acceptance as an animal feed. Distillers grains is a by-product from thefermentation of corn to produce ethanol. Antibiotics may be used during the fermentation process to control bacterial contamination;therefore, antibiotics may be present in small quantities in distillers grains marketed as animal feed. The U. S. Food and DrugAdministration’s Center for Veterinary Medicine has expressed concern about potential animal and human health hazards fromthe use of distillers grains as an animal feed due to the possibility of antibiotic residues. If the public became concerned aboutthe impact of distillers grains in the food supply or as an acceptable animal feed, the market for distillers grains could benegatively impacted, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. We may not be able to obtain a suitablereplacement for antibiotics, should this be required, which would also negatively impact the market for distillers grains. An estimated 36% of distillers grains producedin the United States were exported in 2021. The price of distillers grains has benefitted from the exports of the product. Inrecent years, certain countries have refused to import U.S. distillers grains for a variety of reasons. If export shipments arerejected or delayed, the market price for distillers grains would be negatively impacted, which would have a negative impact onour ethanol results of operations. We extract non-food grade corn oil immediatelyprior to the production of distillers grains. Several studies are attempting to determine whether non-food grade corn oil extractionmay impact the nutritional value of the resulting distillers grains. If it is determined that non-food grade corn oil extractionadversely impacts the nutritional energy content of distillers grains, the value of the distillers grains we sell may be negativelyimpacted, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. We face significant competitionin the ethanol industry. We face significant competitionfor new ethanol investment opportunities. Many of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources and name recognitionthan we do. We must compete for investment opportunities based on our strategy of supporting and enhancing local development ofethanol plant opportunities. We may not be successful in competing for investment opportunities based on our strategy. The ethanol industry isprimarily comprised of entities that engage exclusively in ethanol production and large integrated grain companies that produceethanol along with their base grain business. Several large oil companies have entered the ethanol production market. If thesecompanies increase their ethanol plant ownership or if other oil companies seek to engage in direct ethanol production, therewould be less of a need to purchase ethanol from independent producers such as our ethanol plants. No assurance can be given thatour ethanol plants will be able to compete successfully or that competition from larger companies with greater financial resourceswill not have a materially adverse impact on the results of our ethanol operations.16We may face competitionfrom foreign producers. There is a risk of foreigncompetition in the ethanol industry. Brazil is presently the second largest producer of ethanol in the world. Brazil’s ethanolproduction is sugarcane based, and, depending on feedstock prices, may be cheaper to produce than corn-derived ethanol. Underthe RFS, certain parties were obligated to meet an advanced biofuel standard. In recent years, sugarcane based ethanol importedfrom Brazil has been one of the most economical means for obligated parties to comply with this standard. If significant additionalforeign ethanol production capacity is created, such facilities could create excess supplies of ethanol, which may result in lowerprices of ethanol. In addition, foreign ethanol producers may be able to produce ethanol at costs lower than ours. These riskscould have significant adverse effects on our financial performance. We are exposed to creditrisk from our sales of ethanol and distillers grains to customers. The inability of a customerto make payments to us for our accounts receivable may cause us to experience losses and may adversely impact our liquidity andour ability to make our payments when due. We may not be able tohire and retain qualified personnel to operate our ethanol plants. Our ability to attract andretain competent personnel has a significant impact on operating efficiencies and plant profitability. Competition for key plantemployees in the ethanol industry can be intense, and there has been an increased demand for workers in the U.S. We may not beable to attract and retain qualified employees. Failure to do so could have a negative impact on our financial results at individualplants. Our plants depend on an uninterrupted supply of energy and waterto operate. Unforeseen plant shutdowns could harm our business. Our plants require a significant and uninterruptedsupply of natural gas, electricity and water to operate. We generally rely on third parties to provide these resources. If thereis an interruption in the supply of energy or water for any reason, such as supply, delivery or mechanical problems and we areunable to secure an adequate alternative supply to sustain plant operations, we may be required to stop production. A productionhalt for an extended period of time could result in material losses. We rely on information technology in ouroperations and financial reporting and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security breach of that technology couldharm our ability to efficiently operate our business and report our financial results accurately and timely. We rely heavily on information technologysystems across our operations, including for management of inventory, purchase orders, production, invoices, shipping, accountingand various other processes and transactions. Our ability to effectively manage our business, coordinate the production, distributionand sale of our products and ensure the timely and accurate recording and disclosure of financial information depends significantlyon the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioningto upgraded or replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems through a cyber-attack or otherwise could cause delaysand/or interruptions in plant operations, product sales, reduced efficiency of our operations and delays in reporting our financialresults. Significant capital investments could be required to remediate any such problem. Security breaches of employee informationor other confidential or proprietary data could also adversely impact our reputation and could result in litigation against usor the imposition of penalties.17We are exposed to potential business disruptionfrom factors outside our control, including natural disasters, severe weather conditions, accidents, pandemic diseases, internationaldisputes, and unforeseen operational failures any of which could negatively affect our transportation operations and could adverselyaffect our cash flows and operating results. Potential business disruption in availabletransportation due to natural disasters, severe weather conditions, the outbreak of a pandemic disease, significant track damageresulting from a train derailment, strikes or other interruptions by our transportation providers could result in delays in procuringand supplying raw materials to our ethanol facilities, or transporting ethanol and distillers grains to our customers. Such businessdisruptions may result in our inability to meet customer demand or contract delivery requirements, as well as the potential lossof customers. Rail cars used to transport ethanol mayneed to be modified or replaced to meet proposed rail safety regulations. The leased rail cars we use to transport ethanolto market will need to be retrofitted or replaced as the Enhanced Tank Car Standards and Operation Controls for High-Hazard FlammableTrains adopted by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) imposes an enhanced tank car standard known as theDOT specification 117 and establishes a schedule to retrofit or replace older tank cars that carry crude oil and ethanol. Therule also establishes braking standards intended to reduce the severity of accidents and new operational protocols. This couldlead to increased rail car lease costs and delays in transportation of ethanol if rail cars are out of service for extended periodsof time. We operate in a capital intensive industry.Limitations on external financing could adversely affect our financial performance. We may need to incur additional financingto fund growth of our business or in times of increasing liquidity requirements (such as increases in raw material costs). Bankruptcyfilings by several ethanol companies in past years and capital market volatility has reduced available capital for the ethanolindustry. Any delays in obtaining additional financing, or our inability to do so, could have a material adverse impact on ourfinancial results. Risks Related to our Refined Coal Operations We believe our refined coal production companyqualified to earn tax credits under IRC Section 45 through November 18, 2021. Our ability to generate returns and avoid write-offsin connection with this investment is subject to various risks and uncertainties. These include, but are not limited to, the risksand uncertainties as set forth below. Availability of the tax credits under IRC Section 45. Our ability to claim tax credits under IRCSection 45 depends upon our refined coal operation satisfying certain conditions set forth in IRC Section 45. The IRS could ultimatelydetermine that our refined coal facility and/or its operations did not satisfy the conditions set forth in IRC Section 45. Ifwe were to lose these tax credits, it could have a material impact on our results of operations.18Our refined coal operation and its by-products may result inenvironmental and product liability claims and environmental compliance costs. The construction and operation of refinedcoal operations are subject to Federal, state and local laws, regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relatingto the protection or preservation of the environment, natural resources and human health and safety. Such laws and regulationsgenerally require the operations and/or the utilities at which the operations are located to obtain and comply with various environmentalregistrations, licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Such laws and regulations also impose liability, without regardto fault or the legality of a party’s conduct, on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to, or are otherwiseinvolved in, the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment. Such hazardous substances could bereleased as a result of burning refined coal in a number of ways, including air emissions, wastewater, and by-products such asfly ash. One party may, under certain circumstances, be required to bear more than its share or the entire share of investigationand cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtained from other responsible parties. We may be exposedto the risk of becoming liable for environmental damage we may have had little, if any, involvement in creating. Such risk remainseven after production ceases at an operation to the extent the environmental damage can be traced to the types of chemicals orcompounds used or operations conducted in connection with the use of refined coal. No assurances can be given thatcontractual arrangements and precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators willresult in that facility owner or operator accepting full responsibility for any environmental damage. It is also not uncommonfor private claims by third parties alleging contamination to also include claims for personal injury, property damage,diminution of property or similar claims. Furthermore, many environmental, health and safety laws authorize citizen suits,permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits and force compliance. Our insurance may not coverall environmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of an environmental claim. Ifsignificant uninsured losses arise from environmental damage or product liability claims, or if the costs of environmentalcompliance increase for any reason, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. We will have to generate taxable incometo utilize the Section 45 federal production tax credits. If we do not generate sufficient taxable incometo utilize the tax credits earned by our refined coal operation, we could incur write-offs of the related tax attributes whichcould adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We used patented technology. As part of the operations, we paid a licensefee for patented technology. If our third party operator is subject to patent infringement claims, we may incur legal fees todefend our position and be subject to additional costs and fees. Risks Related to our eSteam investment eSteam testing methods and results arenot known. We do not have specific testing methodologiesor specifications developed for testing the viability of the eSteam technology. The actual eSteam testing process could resultin injury to others, and property and other damages that could expose us to claims for damages from unrelated parties.19Our eSteam technology may be subject topatent challenges. If our patents of the eSteam technology arechallenged, we could be required to spend considerable time and resources defending our patents. Operations utilizing our eSteam technologymay cause environmental damage. When testing and operating the eSteam technology,we may cause environmental damage, as we would be injecting water and other fluids into the ground to generate underground steamin order to extract oil. We could be subject to significant penalties and fines if we were to cause environmental damage. Risks Related to REX and General Risk Factors
 We have concentrations of cash depositsat financial institutions that exceed federal insurance limits.  We generally have cash deposits that exceedfederal insurance limits. Should the financial institutions we deposit our cash in experience insolvency or other financial difficulty,our access to cash deposits could be limited. In extreme cases, we could lose our cash deposits entirely. This would negativelyimpact our liquidity and results of operations. We may fail to realize the anticipatedbenefits of mergers, acquisitions, or other investments. We intend to continue seeking growth opportunities.Acquisitions and similar transactions involve many risks that could harm our business, which include:●The                                         anticipated benefits of these transactions may not be fully realized, or take longer                                         to realize than expected,●Future                                         acquisitions could result in operating losses or loss of investment,●Future                                         acquisitions may involve incurring debt to complete these transactions, which could have                                         a material adverse effect on our financial condition, and●Future                                         acquisitions may require us to invest a significant portion of our excess cash, which                                         could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Rising focus on environmental, social andcorporate governance matters from investors and regulators may increase our operating costs, bring down the value of our productsand assets, and impact our ability to access capital markets. Global climate change continues to receivesignificant attention from the public and the scientific community concerning the impacts from human activity, particularly theimpact of greenhouse gas emissions, such as those from carbon dioxide and methane. The Biden administration’s focus on environmentalissues has added pressure to take action domestically where there was already a heavier focus internationally. International,national, and local regulations are likely to increase in the coming years. Added requirements to reduce greenhouse gas emissionsmay increase our production costs. In addition, legislation promoting alternatives to combustion engine vehicles could reducethe demand for our products. Climate change is also thought by some tobe the cause for an increase in extreme weather events such as increased intensity of storms, rising sea levels, as well as heavyrains or droughts in areas historically less prone to those events. Any of these events can have a significant impact on our operationsor quality of raw materials we purchase, resulting in increased costs. At this time, we are unable to determine the financialimpact of any potential adverse weather events caused by climate change.20Incremental to legislative and regulatorypressure, institutional investors have continued to adopt environmental, social and governance guidelines (ESG). Some investors,including certain public and private fund management firms, pension funds, university endowments and family, have in recent years,begun adding stated policies to reduce or eliminate fossil fuel equities and encouraging additional consideration of ESG practicesin a manner that could negatively impact our stock price. This may also result in a reduction of available capital funding forpotential development projects, further impacting our future financial results. Federal, state and local jurisdictionsmay challenge our tax return positions. We use significant judgments, estimates andinterpretation and application of complex tax laws in preparing the tax returns we file, and the positions contained therein.We believe that our tax return positions are fully supportable. However, certain positions may be successfully challenged by federal,state and local jurisdictions. We are currently undergoing a federal income examination for the years ended January 31, 2015 through2020. This could result in material additional income tax payments we would have to make and higher income tax expense in futureperiods. "
18,REX,REX AMERICAN RESOURCES CORP,2021-04-12,"Risk Factors
  We encourage you to carefully considerthe risks described below and other information contained in this report when considering an investment decision in REX commonstock. Any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If one or more of these events do occur, our results ofoperations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In this instance, the trading price of REXstock could decline, and investors might lose all or part of their investment. Risks Related to our Ethanol and By-ProductsBusiness During the early months of 2020, a newstrain of COVID-19 spread into the United States and other countries. In an effort to contain the spread of thisvirus, there have been various government mandated restrictions, in addition to voluntary privately implemented restrictions, includinglimiting public gatherings, retail store closures, restrictions on employees working and the quarantining of people who may havebeen exposed to the virus. The duration of the resulting downturn in economic activity is unknown. However, it has led to reduceddemand for ethanol. This could lead to prolonged production stoppages at our ethanol plants and could result in an adverse materialimpact on the results of operations and on our financial position. We idled our NuGen and One Earth ethanol plants for portionsof fiscal year 2020. The ethanol industry is changing rapidlywhich could result in unexpected developments that could negatively impact our operations. According to the RFA, the ethanol industryhas grown from approximately 1.5 billion gallons of domestic annual ethanol production in 1999 to approximately 16.1 billion gallonsin 2018. In 2020 and 2019, the industry produced approximately 13.8 and 15.8 billion gallons, respectively, with the reductionreflecting industry conditions. Thus, there have been significant changes in the supply and demand of ethanol over a relativelyshort period of time which could lead to difficulty in maintaining profitable operations at our ethanol plants.8The financial returns on our ethanolinvestments are highly dependent on commodity prices, which are subject to significant volatility, uncertainty and regional supplyshortages, so our results could fluctuate substantially. The financial returnson our ethanol investments are highly dependent on commodity prices, especially prices for corn, natural gas, ethanol, dried distillersgrains, non-food grade corn oil and unleaded gasoline. As a result of the volatility of the prices for these items, our returnsmay fluctuate substantially and our investments could experience periods of declining prices for their products and increasingcosts for their raw materials, which could result in operating losses at our ethanol plants. Our returns onethanol investments are highly sensitive to grain prices.  Corn is the principalraw material our ethanol plants use to produce ethanol and by-products. As a result, changes in the price of corn can significantlyaffect our businesses. Rising corn prices result in higher production costs of ethanol and by-products. Because ethanol competeswith non-corn-based fuels, our ethanol plants may not be able to pass along increased grain costs to our customers. At certainlevels, grain prices may make ethanol uneconomical to produce. The price of corn isinfluenced by weather conditions and other factors affecting crop yields, transportation costs, farmer planting decisions, exports,the value of the U.S. dollar and general economic, market and regulatory factors. These factors include government policies andsubsidies with respect to agriculture and international trade and global and local demand and supply. The significance and relativeeffect of these factors on the price of corn is difficult to predict. Any event that tends to negatively affect the productionand/or supply of corn, such as adverse weather or crop disease, could increase corn prices and potentially harm the business ofour ethanol plants, to include intermittent production slowdowns or stoppages. Increasing domestic ethanol capacity could boostthe demand for corn and result in increased corn prices. International demand for corn could also result in higher corn prices.Our ethanol plants may also have difficulty, from time to time, in physically sourcing corn on economic terms due to regional supplyshortages, transportation issues, delays in farmer marketing decisions or unfavorable local pricing. Such a shortage or price impactcould require our ethanol plants to suspend operations which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results ofoperations. The spread betweenethanol and corn prices can vary significantly. The gross margin at ourethanol plants depends principally on the spread between ethanol and corn prices. Fluctuations in the spread are likely to continueto occur. A sustained narrow or negative spread, whether as a result of sustained high or increased corn prices or sustained lowor decreased ethanol prices, would adversely affect the results of operations at our ethanol plants. Our risk managementstrategies may be ineffective and may expose us to decreased profitability and liquidity. In an attempt to partiallyoffset the impact of volatility of commodity prices, we enter into: i) forward contracts to sell a portion of our ethanol and distillersgrains production and to purchase a portion of our corn and natural gas requirements and; ii) commodity futures and swap agreements.The financial impact of these risk management activities is dependent upon, among other items, the prices involved and our abilityto receive or deliver the commodities involved. Risk management activities can result in financial loss when positions are purchasedin a declining market or when positions are sold in an increasing market. In addition, we may not be able to match the appropriatequantity of corn contracts with quantities of ethanol, distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil contracts. We vary the amountand type of risk management techniques we utilize, and we may choose not to engage in any risk management activities. Should wefail to properly manage the inherent volatility of commodity prices, our results of operations and financial condition may be adverselyaffected.9The market fornatural gas is subject to market conditions that create uncertainty in the price and availability of the natural gas that our ethanolplants use in their manufacturing process.  Our ethanol plants relyupon third parties for their supply of natural gas, which is consumed as fuel in the production process. The prices for and availabilityof natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions. These market conditions often are affected by factors beyond the ethanolplants’ control, such as weather conditions, overall economic conditions, governmental regulation and foreign and domesticrelations. Significant disruptions in the supply of natural gas could impair or completely prevent the ethanol plants’ abilityto economically manufacture ethanol for their customers. Furthermore, increases in natural gas prices may adversely affect resultsof operations and financial position at our ethanol plants. Fluctuations in the selling priceof commodities may reduce profit margins at our ethanol plants. Ethanol is marketed as a fuel additiveto reduce vehicle emissions from gasoline, as an octane enhancer to improve the octane rating of gasoline with which it is blendedand, to a lesser extent, as a gasoline substitute. As a result, ethanol prices are influenced by the supply and demand for gasoline,and our ethanol plants’ results of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected if gasoline demanddecreases or the price of gasoline declines making ethanol less economical. Distillers grains compete with other proteinbased animal feed products. The price of distillers grains may decrease when the prices of competing feed products decrease. Theprices of competing animal feed products are based in part on the prices of the commodities from which these products are made.Historically, sales prices for distillers grains have tracked along with the price of corn. However, there have been instanceswhen the price increase for distillers grains has lagged increases in corn prices. The production of distillers grains hasincreased as a result of increases in dry mill ethanol production in the United States. This could lead to price declines in whatwe can sell our distillers grains for in the future. Such declines could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Increased ethanolproduction or decreases in demand for ethanol may result in excess production capacity in the ethanol industry, which may causethe price of ethanol, distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil to decrease.  According to the RFA,domestic ethanol production capacity is approximately 17.4 billion gallons per year. The EPA set the RFS requirement to be satisfiedby corn-derived ethanol at 15.0 billion gallons for 2019 and 2020. However, the RFS requirements have been reduced through smallrefiner waivers (“SRWs”) issued by the EPA. These SRWs were in the amount of approximately 4.0 billion gallons for85 refinery exemptions of ethanol for 2016 through 2018. There have been no rulings on waiver requests for subsequent years. TheEPA has not yet released a draft rule for the 2021 volumes, despite the fact they typically release a draft mid-year of the precedingyear and finalize the rule by November 30 of the preceding year. Excess capacity in the ethanol industry could have an adverseeffect on the results of our operations. In a manufacturing industry with excess capacity, producers have an incentive to manufactureadditional products for so long as the price exceeds the marginal cost of production (i.e., the cost of producing only the nextunit, without regard for interest, overhead or fixed costs). This incentive could result in the reduction of the market price ofethanol to a level that is inadequate to generate sufficient cash flow to cover costs. Excess capacity may alsoresult from decreases in the demand for ethanol, which could result from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, regulatorydevelopments and reduced U.S. gasoline consumption. Reduced gasoline consumption could occur as a result of increased prices forgasoline or crude oil, which could cause businesses and consumers to reduce driving or acquire vehicles with more favorable gasolinemileage or acquire non-gasoline powered vehicles. In addition, decreased overall economic activity could also lead to reduced gasolineconsumption.10In addition, becauseethanol production produces distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil as by-products, increased ethanol production will alsolead to increased supplies of distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil. An increase in the supply of distillers grains andnon-food grade corn oil, without corresponding increases in demand, could lead to lower prices or an inability to sell our ethanolplants’ distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil production. A decline in the price of distillers grains or non-foodgrade corn oil could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations. The price of ethanol and distillersgrains may decline as a result of trade restrictions or duties on ethanol and distillers grains exports from the United Statesor from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.  If the United States were to withdraw fromor materially modify certain international trade agreements, our business, financial condition and results of operations couldbe materially adversely affected. Ethanol and other products that we produce are sold into various other countries with trade agreementswith the United States. If tariffs were raised on the foreign-sourced goods that lead to retaliatory actions, it could have materialadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The United States exported approximately1.3 billion gallons of ethanol in 2020, down from approximately 1.5 and approximately 1.7 billion gallons in 2019 and 2018, respectively.If producers and exporters of ethanol are subject to trade restrictions, or additional duties are imposed on exports, it may makeit uneconomical to export ethanol. Brazil, China and the European Union all have trade barriers or tariffs against fuel ethanol.In 2013, the European Union imposed a five year tariff of $83.33 per metric ton on U.S. fuel ethanol to discourage competition.Effective January 1, 2017, China indicated its intention to raise its 5% tariff on U.S. and Brazil fuel ethanol to 30%. On April1, 2018, China raised their tariff rate to 45%, and later raised it to 70% in the U.S. and China trade war. On September 1, 2017,Brazil imposed a 20% tariff on U.S. fuel ethanol imports in excess of 150 million liters, or 39.6 million gallons per quarter.The tariff was extended several times but lapsed in December 2020 and a 20% tariff now applies to all U.S. ethanol exported toBrazil. This could result in an oversupply of ethanol in the United States, which could have a material adverse effect on the resultsof our ethanol operations. In 2020, approximately 11.0 million metrictons (“mmt”) of distillers grains were exported which represented a record high of 38% of U.S. production. However,the export market may be jeopardized if foreign governments impose trade barriers or other measures to protect the foreign localmarkets. Exports to China were approximately 2% of U.S. global shipments in 2019 versus approximately 51% in 2015, due to punitivetariffs established beginning January 2017 in effect for 5 years per the RFA. Chinese exports rebounded slightly in 2020 but stillremained depressed compared to earlier years. If producers and exporters of distillers grains are subjected to trade barriers whenselling distillers grains to foreign customers, there may be a reduction in the price of distillers grains in the United States.In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could reduce the demand for United States exports of distillers grains.Declines in the price we receive for our distillers grains could lead to decreased revenues and may result in our inability tooperate our ethanol plants profitably. Future demand for ethanol is uncertainand changes in overall consumer demand for transportation fuel could affect demand. There are limited markets for ethanol otherthan what is federally mandated. Increased consumer acceptance of E15 and E85 fuel is likely necessary in order for ethanol toachieve significant market share growth beyond federal mandate levels.11We depend on our partners to operatecertain of our ethanol investments. Our investments currently represent bothmajority and minority equity positions. Day-to-day operating control of minority owned plants generally remains with the localinvestor group. We do not have the ability to directly modify the operations of these plants in response to changes in the businessenvironment or in response to any deficiencies in local operations of the plants. In addition, local plant operators, who alsorepresent the primary suppliers of corn and other crops to the plants, may have interests, such as the price and sourcing of cornand other crops, that may differ from our interest, which is based solely on the operating profit of the plant. The limitationson our ability to control day-to-day plant operations could adversely affect plant results of operations. We may not successfully acquire or developadditional ethanol investments. The growth of our ethanolbusiness depends on our ability to identify and develop new ethanol investments. Our ethanol development strategy depends on referrals,and introductions, to new investment opportunities from industry participants, such as ethanol plant builders and owners, financialinstitutions, marketing agents and others. We must continue to maintain favorable relationships with these industry participants,and a material disruption in these sources of referrals would adversely affect our ability to expand our ethanol investments. Any expansion strategywill depend on prevailing market conditions for the price of ethanol and the cost of corn and natural gas and the expectationsof future market conditions. Additional financing may also be necessary to implement any expansion strategy, which may not be accessibleor available on acceptable terms. In addition, failure to adequately manage the risks associated with additional ethanol investmentscould have a material adverse effect on our business. Our ethanol plants may be adverselyaffected by technological advances and efforts to anticipate and employ such technological advances may prove unsuccessful.  The development and implementation of newtechnologies may result in a significant reduction in the costs of ethanol production. For instance, any technological advancesin the efficiency or cost to produce ethanol from inexpensive cellulosic sources such as corn stalk, wheat, oat or barley strawcould have an adverse effect on our ethanol plants, because our plants are designed to produce ethanol from corn, which is, bycomparison, a raw material with other high value uses. We cannot predict when new technologies may become available, the rate ofacceptance of new technologies by competitors or the costs associated with new technologies. In addition, advances in the developmentof alternatives to ethanol could significantly reduce demand for or eliminate the need for ethanol. Any advances in technology which requiresignificant unanticipated capital expenditures to remain competitive or which reduce demand or prices for ethanol would have amaterial adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations. In addition, alternative fuels, additivesand oxygenates are continually under development. Alternative fuel additives that can replace ethanol may be developed, which maydecrease the demand for ethanol. It is also possible that technological advances in engine and exhaust system design and performancecould reduce the use of oxygenates, which would lower the demand for ethanol. Consumer demand for gasoline may be reduced by transportationrelated technological advances such as electric and hybrid vehicles. Several automobile manufacturers have announced target datesinto the 2030s for ceasing production of gasoline vehicles and shifting production to electric vehicles. In addition, countriessuch as Japan and the United Kingdom as well as the state of California have pledged to ban the sale of vehicles with internalcombustion engines over time. The Biden administration, in its early stages, appears to have placed an increased emphasis on electric vehicles. Reduced demand for ethanol could cause our results of operations to be materially adversely affected.12The U.S. ethanol industry is highlydependent upon a myriad of federal and state legislation and regulation and any changes in legislation or regulation could materiallyand adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. The renewable fuel standard program wasauthorized under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and was expanded under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA).EISA increased the amount of renewable fuel required to be blended into gasoline and required a minimum usage of corn-derived renewablefuels of 12.0 billion gallons in 2010, increasing annually by 600 million gallons to 15.0 billion gallons in 2015 through 2022,with no specified volume subsequent to 2022. The EPA has the authority to assign the mandated amounts of renewable fuels to beblended into transportation fuel to individual fuel blenders. RFS II has been a primary factor in the growth of ethanol usage.Over the past several years various pieces of legislation have been introduced to the U.S. Congress that were intended to reduceor eliminate ethanol blending requirements. To date, none of the bills have been successful but they are an indication of the continuedeffort to undermine the EISA. Under EISA, the EPA has the authority towaive or modify the mandated RFS II requirements in whole or in part. In order to grant a waiver, the EPA administrator must determinein consultation with the Secretaries of Agriculture and Energy, that one of the following two conditions has been met: i) thereis inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply or ii) implementation of the requirement would severely harm the economy or environmentof a state, region or the country. In certain past years the EPA has taken action to reduce the mandated gallons called for underEISA for both conventional and advanced renewable fuels. Pursuant to RFS II, if mandatory renewablefuel volumes are reduced by at least 20% for two consecutive years, the EPA is required to modify, or reset, statutory volumesthrough 2022. While conventional ethanol was maintained at 15 billion gallons, 2019 was the second consecutive year the total proposedRVOs was more than 20% below statutory volumes levels. The EPA Administrator directed his staff to initiate the reset rulemakingprocess. However, the EPA announced it would not move forward with a reset rulemaking in 2020. After 2022, volumes will be determinedby the EPA in coordination with the Secretaries of Energy and Agriculture, taking into account such factors as environmental impact,energy security, future production rates, costs to consumers, infrastructure, impacts on commodity and food prices, job creationand rural economic development. Obligated parties use RINs to show compliancewith RFS-mandated volumes. RINs are attached to renewable fuels by producers and detached when the renewable fuel is blended withtransportation fuel or traded in the open market. The market price of detached RINs affects the price of ethanol in certain marketsand influences the purchasing decisions by obligated parties. As a result of fluctuations in RINs pricing, certain obligated partieshave petitioned the EPA and filed court actions to change the point of obligation or to seek relief from their obligation. TheEPA granted 85 total SRWs for 2016 through 2018 totaling approximately 4.0 billion gallons. This action led to reduced values forRINs and further action could decrease RIN values and ethanol pricing. In January 2020, the U.S Court of Appealsfor the 10th Circuit overturned the EPA’s granting of refinery exemptions to three refineries on two separategrounds. The Court ruled refineries are eligible for SRWs only if such waivers are extensions of waivers granted in previous years.The refineries did not qualify for waivers in the year prior to the year the EPA granted them. The Court also stated the disproportionateeconomic hardship of SRWs should be based solely on whether compliance with RFS II creates such hardship, not whether complianceand other issues create the hardship. The refiners appeal was denied. Two of the refiners appealed the decision to the U.S. SupremeCourt, and in January 2021, the Supreme Court announced they agreed to hear the case.13Due to the 10th Circuit ruling,a number of refiners have applied for gap year SRWs in an effort to establish continuous years of relief and to attempt to ensurethey qualify for SRWs going forward. Until the Supreme Court rules on this case, there remains uncertainty regarding volume obligations.The EPA has not ruled on SRWs for years after 2018. At the same time the EPA took action (in2019) to allow the RVP waiver for E-15 for the summer months, it also took RIN market reform action. The reform action requirespublic disclosure when RIN holdings exceed specified thresholds by an entity and requires the reporting of additional price andaffiliate data to the EPA. Flexible fuel vehicles receive preferentialtreatment in meeting federally mandated corporate average fuel economy (“CAFE”) standards for automobiles manufacturedby car makers. High blend ethanol fuels such as E-85 result in lower fuel efficiencies. Absent the CAFE preferences, car makerswould not likely build flexible-fuel vehicles. Any change in CAFE preferences could reduce the growth of E-85 markets and resultin lower ethanol prices. Unfavorable changes in legislation or regulationscould materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. The inability to generate or obtainRINs could adversely affect our operating results. Virtually all of our ethanol is sold with RINs that are used by customersto comply with RFS II. If our production does not meet EPA requirements for RIN generation in the future, we would have to purchaseRINs in the open market or sell our ethanol at substantially lower prices to adjust for the absence of RINs. The price of RINsvaries based on many factors and cannot be predicted. Failure to obtain sufficient RINS or reliance on invalid RINs could subjectus to fines and penalties imposed by the EPA. Various studies have criticized theefficiency of ethanol, in general, and corn-based ethanol in particular, which could lead to the reduction or repeal of incentivesand tariffs that promote the use and domestic production of ethanol or otherwise negatively impact public perception and acceptanceof ethanol as an alternative fuel.  Although many trade groups, academics andgovernmental agencies have supported ethanol as a fuel additive that promotes a cleaner environment, others have criticized ethanolproduction as consuming considerably more energy and emitting more greenhouse gases than other biofuels and as potentially depletingwater resources. Other studies have suggested that corn-based ethanol is less efficient than ethanol produced from switchgrassor wheat grain and that it negatively impacts consumers by causing prices to increase for dairy, meat and other foodstuffs fromlivestock that consume corn. If these views gain acceptance, supportfor existing measures promoting use and domestic production of corn-based ethanol could decline, leading to reduction or repealof these measures. These views could also negatively impact public perception of the ethanol industry and acceptance of ethanolas an alternative fuel.14Federal support of cellulosic ethanolmay result in reduced incentives to corn-derived ethanol producers.  The American Recovery and ReinvestmentAct of 2009 and EISA provide funding opportunities in support of cellulosic ethanol obtained from biomass sources such as switchgrassand poplar trees. The amended RFS mandates an increasing level of production of non-corn-derived biofuels. These federal policiesmay suggest a long-term political preference for cellulosic processes using alternative feedstocks such as switchgrass, silageor wood chips. Cellulosic ethanol has a smaller carbon footprint than corn-derived ethanol and is unlikely to divert foodstufffrom the market. Our plants are designed as single-feedstock facilities, located in corn production areas with limited alternativefeedstock nearby, and would require significant additional investment to convert to the production of cellulosic ethanol. The adoptionof cellulosic ethanol as the preferred form of ethanol could have a significant adverse effect on our ethanol business. Our ethanol business is affected by environmental and otherregulations which could impede or prohibit our ability to successfully operate our plants. Our ethanol production facilities are subjectto extensive air, water and other environmental regulations. We have had to obtain numerous permits to construct and operate ourplants. Regulatory agencies could impose conditions or other restrictions in the permits that are detrimental, or which increaseour costs. More stringent federal or state environmental regulations could be adopted which could significantly increase our operatingcosts or require us to expend considerable resources. Our ethanol plants emit various airbornepollutants as by-products of the ethanol production process, including carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas). In 2007, the U.S. SupremeCourt classified carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act in a case seeking to require the EPA to regulate carbondioxide in vehicle emissions. In February 2010, the EPA released its final regulations on the Renewable Fuel Standard program.We believe our plants are grandfathered up to certain operating capacity, but recent plant expansion requires us to meet a 20%threshold reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from a 2005 baseline measurement to produce ethanol eligible for the RFSII mandate. To further expand our plant capacity, we may be required to obtain additional permits, install advanced technologyequipment, or reduce drying of certain amounts of distillers grains. We may also be required to install carbon dioxide mitigationequipment or take other steps in order to comply with future laws or regulations. Compliance with future laws or regulations withrespect to emissions of carbon dioxide, or if we choose to expand capacity at certain of our plants, compliance with then-currentregulations of carbon dioxide, could be costly and may prevent us from operating our plants as profitably, which may have a negativeimpact on our financial performance. We also face the risk of ethanol production above our grandfathered capacity not qualifyingfor RINS if the plants do not meet certain emission requirements. The California Air Resources Board (“CARB”)adopted a Low Carbon Fuel Standard (“LCFS”) requiring a 10% reduction in GHG emissions from transportation fuels. AnIndirect Land Use Charge is included in this lifecycle GHG emission calculation. This standard could have an adverse impact onthe market for corn-based ethanol in California if corn-based ethanol fails to achieve lifecycle GHG emission reductions and inother states if they adopt similar standards. This could have a negative impact on our financial performance. Our ethanol business may become subjectto various environmental and health and safety and property damage claims and liabilities.  Operation of our ethanol business exposesthe business to the risk of environmental and health and safety claims and property damage claims, such as failure to comply withenvironmental regulations. These types of claims could also be made against our ethanol business based upon the acts or omissionsof other persons. Serious claims could have a material negative impact on our results of operations, financial position and futurecash flows.15Our business is not diversified.  Our financial results depend heavily onour ability to operate our ethanol plants profitably. Our lack of diversification could have a material negative impact on ourresults of operations, financial position and future cash flows should our ethanol plants operate unprofitably. We may have commitments to produce andsell ethanol. We may, at times, sell our products withforward contracts. If we are unable to produce the products due to economic conditions, business interruption, or other factors,we may incur additional costs or have to obtain commodities at unfavorable prices to meet our contractual commitments. This couldhave a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We may have commitments to purchasecommodities. We may, at times, purchase certain commoditieswith forward contracts without a corresponding quantity of ethanol sold via forward contracts at known prices. Should ethanol andby-product prices decline to levels that would lead to significant unprofitable results of operations, we may incur additionalcosts and/or losses to meet our contractual commitments. This could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our revenue from the sale of distillersgrains depends upon its continued market acceptance as an animal feed. Distillers grains is a by-product fromthe fermentation of corn to produce ethanol. Antibiotics may be used during the fermentation process to control bacterial contamination;therefore, antibiotics may be present in small quantities in distillers grains marketed as animal feed. The U. S. Food and DrugAdministration’s Center for Veterinary Medicine has expressed concern about potential animal and human health hazards fromthe use of distillers grains as an animal feed due to the possibility of antibiotic residues. If the public became concerned aboutthe impact of distillers grains in the food supply or as an acceptable animal feed, the market for distillers grains could be negativelyimpacted, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. We may not be able to obtain a suitable replacementfor antibiotics, should this be required, which would also negatively impact the market for distillers grains. An estimated 38% of distillers grains producedin the United States were exported in 2020. The price of distillers grains has benefitted from the exports of the product. In recentyears, certain countries have refused to import U.S. distillers grains for a variety of reasons. If export shipments are rejectedor delayed, the market price for distillers grains would be negatively impacted, which would have a negative impact on our ethanolresults of operations. We extract non-food grade corn oil immediatelyprior to the production of distillers grains. Several studies are attempting to determine whether non-food grade corn oil extractionmay impact the nutritional value of the resulting distillers grains. If it is determined that non-food grade corn oil extractionadversely impacts the nutritional energy content of distillers grains, the value of the distillers grains we sell may be negativelyimpacted, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations.16We face significantcompetition in the ethanol industry. We face significant competitionfor new ethanol investment opportunities. There are varied enterprises seeking to participate in the ethanol industry. Some enterprisesprovide financial and management support similar to our business model. Other enterprises seek to acquire or develop plants whichthey will directly own and operate. Many of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources and name recognitionthan we do. We must compete for investment opportunities based on our strategy of supporting and enhancing local development ofethanol plant opportunities. We may not be successful in competing for investment opportunities based on our strategy. The ethanol industryis primarily comprised of entities that engage exclusively in ethanol production and large integrated grain companies that produceethanol along with their base grain business. Several large oil companies have entered the ethanol production market. If thesecompanies increase their ethanol plant ownership or if other oil companies seek to engage in direct ethanol production, there wouldbe less of a need to purchase ethanol from independent producers such as our ethanol plants. No assurance can be given that ourethanol plants will be able to compete successfully or that competition from larger companies with greater financial resourceswill not have a materially adverse impact on the results of our ethanol operations. We may face competitionfrom foreign producers. There is a risk of foreigncompetition in the ethanol industry. Brazil is presently the second largest producer of ethanol in the world. Brazil’s ethanolproduction is sugarcane based, and, depending on feedstock prices, may be cheaper to produce than corn-derived ethanol. Under theRFS, certain parties were obligated to meet an advanced biofuel standard. In recent years, sugarcane based ethanol imported fromBrazil has been one of the most economical means for obligated parties to comply with this standard. If significant additionalforeign ethanol production capacity is created, such facilities could create excess supplies of ethanol, which may result in lowerprices of ethanol. In addition, foreign ethanol producers may be able to produce ethanol at costs lower than ours. These riskscould have significant adverse effects on our financial performance. We are exposed tocredit risk from our sales of ethanol and distillers grains to customers. The inability of a customerto make payments to us for our accounts receivable may cause us to experience losses and may adversely impact our liquidity andour ability to make our payments when due. We may not be ableto hire and retain qualified personnel to operate our ethanol plants. Our ability to attractand retain competent personnel has a significant impact on operating efficiencies and plant profitability. Competition for keyplant employees in the ethanol industry can be intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees. Failureto do so could have a negative impact on our financial results at individual plants. Our plants depend on an uninterrupted supply of energy andwater to operate. Unforeseen plant shutdowns could harm our business. Our plants require a significant and uninterruptedsupply of natural gas, electricity and water to operate. We generally rely on third parties to provide these resources. If thereis an interruption in the supply of energy or water for any reason, such as supply, delivery or mechanical problems and we areunable to secure an adequate alternative supply to sustain plant operations, we may be required to stop production. A productionhalt for an extended period of time could result in material losses.17We rely on information technology inour operations and financial reporting and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security breach of that technologycould harm our ability to efficiently operate our business and report our financial results accurately and timely. We rely heavily on information technologysystems across our operations, including for management of inventory, purchase orders, production, invoices, shipping, accountingand various other processes and transactions. Our ability to effectively manage our business, coordinate the production, distributionand sale of our products and ensure the timely and accurate recording and disclosure of financial information depends significantlyon the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioningto upgraded or replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems through a cyber-attack or otherwise could cause delaysand/or interruptions in plant operations, product sales, reduced efficiency of our operations and delays in reporting our financialresults. Significant capital investments could be required to remediate any such problem. Security breaches of employee informationor other confidential or proprietary data could also adversely impact our reputation and could result in litigation against usor the imposition of penalties. We are exposed to potential businessdisruption from factors outside our control, including natural disasters, severe weather conditions, accidents, pandemic diseasesand unforeseen operational failures any of which could negatively affect our transportation operations and could adversely affectour cash flows and operating results. Potential businessdisruption in available transportation due to natural disasters, severe weather conditions, the outbreak of a pandemic disease,significant track damage resulting from a train derailment, strikes or other interruptions by our transportation providers couldresult in delays in procuring and supplying raw materials to our ethanol facilities, or transporting ethanol and distillers grainsto our customers. Such business disruptions may result in our inability to meet customer demand or contract delivery requirements,as well as the potential loss of customers. Rail cars used to transport ethanolmay need to be modified or replaced to meet proposed rail safety regulations. The leased rail cars we use to transportethanol to market will need to be retrofitted or replaced as the Enhanced Tank Car Standards and Operation Controls for High-HazardFlammable Trains adopted by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) imposes an enhanced tank car standard knownas the DOT specification 117 and establishes a schedule to retrofit or replace older tank cars that carry crude oil and ethanol.The rule also establishes braking standards intended to reduce the severity of accidents and new operational protocols. This couldlead to increased rail car lease costs and delays in transportation of ethanol if rail cars are out of service for extended periodsof time. We operate in a capital intensive industry.Limitations on external financing could adversely affect our financial performance. We may need to incur additional financingto fund growth of our business or in times of increasing liquidity requirements (such as increases in raw material costs). Bankruptcyfilings by several ethanol companies in past years and capital market volatility has reduced available capital for the ethanolindustry. Any delays in obtaining additional financing, or our inability to do so, could have a material adverse impact on ourfinancial results. Risks Related to our Refined Coal Operations We believe our refined coal productioncompany qualifies to earn tax credits under IRC Section 45 through November 18, 2021. Our ability to generate returns and avoidwrite-offs in connection with this investment is subject to various risks and uncertainties. These include, but are not limitedto, the risks and uncertainties as set forth below.18Availability of the tax credits under IRC Section 45. Our ability to claim tax credits underIRC Section 45 depends upon our refined coal operation satisfying certain ongoing conditions set forth in IRC Section 45. The IRScould ultimately determine that our refined coal facility and/or its operations have not satisfied, or have not continued to satisfy,the conditions set forth in IRC Section 45. As our refined coal operation is expected to generate pre-tax losses, the unavailabilityof the tax credits for any reason could have a material impact on our results of operations. The refined coal operation depends onone customer. The refined coal operation receives taxcredits by selling its refined coal to an unrelated party. The unrelated party is not obligated to continue purchasing refinedcoal from us. Our user of refined coal could convert its fuel source to natural gas, oil or some other source instead of coal dependingon the price of natural gas, oil or other sources relative to that of coal. If the unrelated party ceases to purchase refined coalfrom us, we would likely cease operations, given that we only intend to operate the refined coal plant until November 18, 2021.Market demand for coal may also decline as a result of an economic slowdown. Sustained low natural gas prices may also cause usersof coal to phase out or close existing coal using operations. If users of coal burn less coal or eliminate the use of coal, therewould be less need for our product. A reduction or cessation of refined coal sales could have a material impact on our resultsof operations. Environmental concerns regarding coal could lead to reduced or suspended refined coal operations.  Environmental concerns about greenhousegases, toxic wastewater discharges and the potentially hazardous nature of coal combustion waste could lead to regulations thatdiscourage the burning of coal. Such regulations could mandate that electric power generating companies purchase a minimum amountof power from renewable energy sources such as wind, hydroelectric, solar and geothermal. This could result in utilities burningless coal, which could have a material impact on our results of operations. Our refined coal operation and its by-products may resultin environmental and product liability claims and environmental compliance costs. The construction and operation of refinedcoal operations are subject to Federal, state and local laws, regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating tothe protection or preservation of the environment, natural resources and human health and safety. Such laws and regulations generallyrequire the operations and/or the utilities at which the operations are located to obtain and comply with various environmentalregistrations, licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Such laws and regulations also impose liability, without regardto fault or the legality of a party’s conduct, on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to, or are otherwiseinvolved in, the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment. Such hazardous substances could bereleased as a result of burning refined coal in a number of ways, including air emissions, wastewater, and by-products such asfly ash. One party may, under certain circumstances, be required to bear more than its share or the entire share of investigationand cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtained from other responsible parties. We may be exposed tothe risk of becoming liable for environmental damage we may have had little, if any, involvement in creating. Such risk remainseven after production ceases at an operation to the extent the environmental damage can be traced to the types of chemicals orcompounds used or operations conducted in connection with the use of refined coal.19Once we permanently cease operations, weare responsible to remove all the equipment, supplies and materials from the utility host site. This could result in additionalcost and the risk of environmental damage or impact. No assurances can be given thatcontractual arrangements and precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators willresult in that facility owner or operator accepting full responsibility for any environmental damage. It is also not uncommonfor private claims by third parties alleging contamination to also include claims for personal injury, property damage,diminution of property or similar claims. Furthermore, many environmental, health and safety laws authorize citizen suits,permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits and force compliance. Our insurance may not coverall environmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of an environmental claim. Ifsignificant uninsured losses arise from environmental damage or product liability claims, or if the costs of environmentalcompliance increase for any reason, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. We rely on a third party to operate the refined coal facility. We rely on an unrelated third party tooperate the refined coal plant. Should the third party fail to perform or underperform in the operation, management or regulatorycompliance of the facility, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected as we are not experiencedin operating a refined coal facility. We will have to generate taxable incometo utilize the Section 45 federal production tax credits. If we do not generate sufficient taxableincome to utilize the tax credits earned by our refined coal operation, we could incur write-offs of the related tax attributeswhich could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We use patented technology. As part of the operations, we pay a licensefee for patented technology. If our third party operator is subject to patent infringement claims, we may incur legal fees to defendour position and be subject to additional costs and fees. Risks Related to our eSteam investment eSteam testing methods and results arenot known. We do not have specific testing methodologiesor specifications developed for testing the viability of the eSteam technology. The actual eSteam testing process could resultin injury to others, and property and other damages that could expose us to claims for damages from unrelated parties. Our eSteam technology may be subjectto patent challenges. If our patents of the eSteam technologyare challenged, we could be required to spend considerable time and resources defending our patents. Operations utilizing our eSteam technologymay cause environmental damage. When testing and operating the eSteam technology,we may cause environmental damage, as we would be injecting water and other fluids into the ground to generate underground steamin order to extract oil. We could be subject to significant penalties and fines if we were to cause environmental damage.20Risks Related to REX and General RiskFactors Given the amount of our cash and short-terminvestments, actions by the Federal Reserve, related to the COVID-19 outbreak, which have reduced interest rates and could impactfuture periods. Depending on the length of time interestrates remain at these levels, this could result in an adverse material impact on the results of operations and on our financialposition. We have concentrations of cash depositsat financial institutions that exceed federal insurance limits.  We generally have cash deposits that exceedfederal insurance limits. Should the financial institutions we deposit our cash in experience insolvency or other financial difficulty,our access to cash deposits could be limited. In extreme cases, we could lose our cash deposits entirely. This would negativelyimpact our liquidity and results of operations. We may fail to realize the anticipatedbenefits of mergers, acquisitions, or other investments. We intend to continue seeking growth opportunities.Acquisitions and similar transactions involve many risks that could harm our business, which include: ●The anticipated benefits of these transactions may not be fully realized,or take longer to realize than expected,●Future acquisitions could result in operating losses or loss of investment, ●Future acquisitions may involve incurring debt to complete thesetransactions, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, and●Future acquisitions may require us to invest a significant portionof our excess cash, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Federal, state and local jurisdictionsmay challenge our tax return positions. We use significant judgments, estimatesand interpretation and application of complex tax laws in preparing the tax returns we file, and the positions contained therein.We believe that our tax return positions are fully supportable. However, certain positions may be successfully challenged by federal,state and local jurisdictions. We are currently undergoing a federal income examination for the years ended January 31, 2015, 2016and 2017. This could result in material additional income tax payments we would have to make and higher income tax expense in futureperiods. "
14,REX,REX AMERICAN RESOURCES CORP,2020-04-01," Risk Factors
  We encourage you to carefully consider therisks described below and other information contained in this report when considering an investment decision in REX common stock.Any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If one or more of these events do occur, our results of operations,financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In this instance, the trading price of REX stock coulddecline, and investors might lose all or part of their investment.8  Risks Related to our Ethanol and By-ProductsBusiness During the early months of 2020,a new strain of COVID-19 spread into the United States and other countries.In an effort to contain thespread of this virus, there have been various government mandated restrictions, in addition to voluntary privatelyimplemented restrictions, including limiting public gatherings, retail store closures, restrictions on employees working andthe quarantining of people who may have been exposed to the virus. The duration of the resulting downturn in economicactivity is unknown both on a macro and a micro level. However, it has led to historically low ethanol pricing. This couldlead to prolonged production stoppages at our ethanol plants and could result in an adverse material impact on the results ofoperations and on our financial position. We have idled our NuGen and One Earth ethanol plants.The ethanol industry is changingrapidly which could result in unexpected developments that could negatively impact our operations.According to the RFA, the ethanolindustry has grown from approximately 1.5 billion gallons of domestic annual ethanol production in 1999 to approximately 16.1 billiongallons in 2018. In 2019, the industry produced approximately 15.8 billion gallons, with the reduction reflecting industry conditions.Thus, there have been significant changes in the supply and demand of ethanol over a relatively short period of time which couldlead to difficulty in maintaining profitable operations at our ethanol plants.The financial returns on our ethanolinvestments are highly dependent on commodity prices, which are subject to significant volatility, uncertainty and regional supplyshortages, so our results could fluctuate substantially.The financial returnson our ethanol investments are highly dependent on commodity prices, especially prices for corn, natural gas, ethanol, dried distillersgrains, non-food grade corn oil and unleaded gasoline. As a result of the volatility of the prices for these items, our returnsmay fluctuate substantially and our investments could experience periods of declining prices for their products and increasingcosts for their raw materials, which could result in operating losses at our ethanol plants.Our returnson ethanol investments are highly sensitive to grain prices. Corn is the principalraw material our ethanol plants use to produce ethanol and by-products. As a result, changes in the price of corn can significantlyaffect our businesses. Rising corn prices result in higher production costs of ethanol and by-products. Because ethanol competeswith non-corn-based fuels, our ethanol plants may not be able to pass along increased grain costs to our customers. At certainlevels, grain prices may make ethanol uneconomical to produce.The price of cornis influenced by weather conditions and other factors affecting crop yields, transportation costs, farmer planting decisions, exports,the value of the U.S. dollar and general economic, market and regulatory factors. These factors include government policies andsubsidies with respect to agriculture and international trade and global and local demand and supply. The significance and relativeeffect of these factors on the price of corn is difficult to predict. Any event that tends to negatively affect the productionand/or supply of corn, such as adverse weather or crop disease, could increase corn prices and potentially harm the business ofour ethanol plants, to include intermittent production slowdowns or stoppages. Increasing9  domestic ethanol capacity could boostthe demand for corn and result in increased corn prices. Much of the Midwestern United States experienced adverse weather conditions,primarily during the early months of 2019 which led to a smaller harvest of corn and increased corn prices. Our ethanol plantsmay also have difficulty, from time to time, in physically sourcing corn on economic terms due to regional supply shortages, transportationissues, or unfavorable local pricing. Such a shortage or price impact could require our ethanol plants to suspend operations whichwould have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.The spreadbetween ethanol and corn prices can vary significantly.The gross marginat our ethanol plants depends principally on the spread between ethanol and corn prices. Fluctuations in the spread are likelyto continue to occur. A sustained narrow or negative spread, whether as a result of sustained high or increased corn prices orsustained low or decreased ethanol prices, would adversely affect the results of operations at our ethanol plants.Our risk managementstrategies may be ineffective and may expose us to decreased profitability and liquidity.In an attempt topartially offset the impact of volatility of commodity prices, we enter into forward contracts to sell a portion of our ethanoland distillers grains production and to purchase a portion of our corn and natural gas requirements. The financial impact of theserisk management activities is dependent upon, among other items, the prices involved and our ability to receive or deliver thecommodities involved. Risk management activities can result in financial loss when positions are purchased in a declining marketor when positions are sold in an increasing market. In addition, we may not be able to match the appropriate quantity of corn contractswith quantities of ethanol, distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil contracts. We vary the amount of risk management techniqueswe utilize, and we may choose not to engage in any risk management activities. Should we fail to properly manage the inherent volatilityof commodities prices, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.The marketfor natural gas is subject to market conditions that create uncertainty in the price and availability of the natural gas that ourethanol plants use in their manufacturing process. Our ethanol plantsrely upon third parties for their supply of natural gas, which is consumed as fuel in the production process. The prices for andavailability of natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions. These market conditions often are affected by factors beyondthe ethanol plants’ control, such as weather conditions, overall economic conditions and foreign and domestic governmentalregulation and relations. Significant disruptions in the supply of natural gas could impair or completely prevent the ethanol plants’ability to economically manufacture ethanol for their customers. Furthermore, increases in natural gas prices may adversely affectresults of operations and financial position at our ethanol plants.Fluctuations in the selling priceof commodities may reduce profit margins at our ethanol plants.Ethanol is marketed as a fuel additiveto reduce vehicle emissions from gasoline, as an octane enhancer to improve the octane rating of gasoline with which it is blendedand, to a lesser extent, as a gasoline substitute. As a result, ethanol prices are influenced by the supply and demand for gasolineand our ethanol plants’ results of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected if gasoline demanddecreases or the price of gasoline declines making ethanol less economical.10 Distillers grains compete with otherprotein based animal feed products. The price of distillers grains may decrease when the prices of competing feed products decrease.The prices of competing animal feed products are based in part on the prices of the commodities from which these products are made.Historically, sales prices for distillers grains have tracked along with the price of corn. However, there have been instanceswhen the price increase for distillers grains has lagged price increases in corn prices.The production of distillers grainshas increased as a result of increases in dry mill ethanol production in the United States. This could lead to price declines inwhat we can sell our distillers grains for in the future. Such declines could have an adverse material effect on our results ofoperations.Increased ethanolproduction or decreases in demand for ethanol may result in excess production capacity in the ethanol industry, which may causethe price of ethanol, distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil to decrease. According to theRFA, domestic ethanol production capacity is approximately 16.9 billion gallons per year. The RFA estimates that approximately183 million gallons per year of additional production capacity is under construction or expansion. The EPA set the RFS requirementto be satisfied by corn-derived ethanol at 15.0 billion gallons for 2019 and 2020. However, the RFS requirements have been reducedthrough SRWs issued by the EPA. These SRWs were in the amount of approximately 4.0 billion gallons for 85 refinery exemptions ofethanol for 2016 through 2018. There have been no rulings on waiver requests for subsequent years. As of February 21, 2020, therewere 23 SRW requests pending for compliance year 2019. Excess capacity in the ethanol industry could have an adverse effect onthe results of our operations. In a manufacturing industry with excess capacity, producers have an incentive to manufacture additionalproducts for so long as the price exceeds the marginal cost of production (i.e., the cost of producing only the next unit, withoutregard for interest, overhead or fixed costs). This incentive could result in the reduction of the market price of ethanol to alevel that is inadequate to generate sufficient cash flow to cover costs.Excess capacitymay also result from decreases in the demand for ethanol, which could result from a number of factors, including, but not limitedto, regulatory developments and reduced U.S. gasoline consumption. Reduced gasoline consumption could occur as a result of increasedprices for gasoline or crude oil, which could cause businesses and consumers to reduce driving or acquire vehicles with more favorablegasoline mileage or acquire non-gasoline powered vehicles. In addition, decreased overall economic activity could also lead toreduced gasoline consumption.In addition, becauseethanol production produces distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil as by-products, increased ethanol production will alsolead to increased supplies of distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil. An increase in the supply of distillers grains andnon-food grade corn oil, without corresponding increases in demand, could lead to lower prices or an inability to sell our ethanolplants’ distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil production. A decline in the price of distillers grains or non-foodgrade corn oil could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations.The price of ethanol and distillersgrains may decline as a result of trade restrictions or duties on ethanol and distillers grains exports from the United Statesor from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.The United States exported approximately1.5 billion gallons of ethanol in 2019, down from approximately 1.7 billion gallons in 2018. If producers and exporters of ethanolare subject to trade restrictions, or additional duties are imposed on exports, it may make it uneconomical to export ethanol.Brazil, China and the European Union all have trade barriers or tariffs against fuel ethanol. In 2013, the European Union imposeda five year tariff of $83.33 per metric ton on U.S. fuel ethanol to discourage competition. Effective January 1, 2017, China indicatedits intention to raise its 5% tariff on U.S. and Brazil fuel ethanol to 30%. On April 1, 2018, China raised their tariff rate to45%, and later raised it to 70% in the U.S. and China trade war. On September 11 1, 2017, Brazil imposed a 20% tariff on U.S. fuelethanol imports in excess of 150 million liters, or 39.6 million gallons per quarter. The tariff on U.S. fuel ethanol was validfor two years. In a resolution published August 31, 2019, Brazil raised its annual import quota to 198 million gallons per year,which awaits final approval by the Brazilian government. Furthermore, unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates couldreduce the demand for United States ethanol exports. This could result in an oversupply of ethanol in the United States, whichcould have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations.Exports of distillers grains producedin the United States have been increasing in recent years. In 2019, approximately 10.9 million metric tons (“mmt”)of distillers grains were exported of the approximately 36.0 mmt produced in the U.S. However, the export market may be jeopardizedif foreign governments impose trade barriers or other measures to protect the foreign local markets. The Chinese export marketwas approximately 2% of global shipments in 2019 versus approximately 51% in 2015, due to punitive tariffs established beginningJanuary 2017 in effect for 5 years per the RFA. If producers and exporters of distillers grains are subjected to trade barrierswhen selling distillers grains to foreign customers, there may be a reduction in the price of distillers grains in the United States.In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could reduce the demand for United States exports of distillers grains.Declines in the price we receive for our distillers grains could lead to decreased revenues and may result in our inability tooperate our ethanol plants profitably.Future demand for ethanol is uncertainand changes in overall consumer demand for transportation fuel could affect demand.There are limited markets for ethanolother than what is federally mandated. Increased consumer acceptance of E15 and E85 fuel is likely necessary in order for ethanolto achieve significant market share growth beyond federal mandate levels.We depend on our partners to operatecertain of our ethanol investments.Our investments currently representboth majority and minority equity positions. Day-to-day operating control of minority owned plants generally remains with the localinvestor group. We do not have the ability to directly modify the operations of these plants in response to changes in the businessenvironment or in response to any deficiencies in local operations of the plants. In addition, local plant operators, who alsorepresent the primary suppliers of corn and other crops to the plants, may have interests, such as the price and sourcing of cornand other crops, that may differ from our interest, which is based solely on the operating profit of the plant. The limitationson our ability to control day-to-day plant operations could adversely affect plant results of operations.We may not successfully acquire ordevelop additional ethanol investments.The growth of ourethanol business depends on our ability to identify and develop new ethanol investments. Our ethanol development strategy dependson referrals, and introductions, to new investment opportunities from industry participants, such as ethanol plant builders, financialinstitutions, marketing agents and others. We must continue to maintain favorable relationships with these industry participants,and a material disruption in these sources of referrals would adversely affect our ability to expand our ethanol investments.Any expansion strategywill depend on prevailing market conditions for the price of ethanol and the cost of corn and natural gas and the expectationsof future market conditions. If suitable sites or opportunities are identified, we may not be able to secure the services and productsfrom contractors, engineering firms, construction firms and equipment suppliers necessary to build or expand ethanol plants ona timely basis or on acceptable economic terms. Construction costs may increase to levels that would make a new plant too expensiveto complete or unprofitable to operate. Additional financing may also be necessary to implement 12 any expansion strategy, which maynot be accessible or available on acceptable terms. New and more stringent environmental regulations could increase the operatingcosts and risks of new plants, which, in turn could discourage us from further expansion. In addition, failure to adequately managethe risks associated with additional ethanol investments could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our ethanol plantsmay be adversely affected by technological advances and efforts to anticipate and employ such technological advances may proveunsuccessful. The development and implementationof new technologies may result in a significant reduction in the costs of ethanol production. For instance, any technological advancesin the efficiency or cost to produce ethanol from inexpensive cellulosic sources such as corn stalk, wheat, oat or barley strawcould have an adverse effect on our ethanol plants, because our plants are designed to produce ethanol from corn, which is, bycomparison, a raw material with other high value uses. We cannot predict when new technologies may become available, the rate ofacceptance of new technologies by competitors or the costs associated with new technologies. In addition, advances in the developmentof alternatives to ethanol could significantly reduce demand for or eliminate the need for ethanol.Any advances in technologywhich require significant unanticipated capital expenditures to remain competitive or which reduce demand or prices for ethanolwould have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations.In addition, alternativefuels, additives and oxygenates are continually under development. Alternative fuel additives that can replace ethanol may be developed,which may decrease the demand for ethanol. It is also possible that technological advances in engine and exhaust system designand performance could reduce the use of oxygenates, which would lower the demand for ethanol, and the results of our ethanol operationsmay be materially adversely affected.The U.S. ethanol industry is highlydependent upon a myriad of federal and state legislation and regulation and any changes in legislation or regulation could materiallyand adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.The Energy Independence and SecurityAct of 2007 (EISA) established RFS II, which modified the renewable fuel standard from prior legislation. EISA increased the amountof renewable fuel required to be blended into gasoline and required a minimum usage of corn-derived renewable fuels of 12.0 billiongallons in 2010, increasing annually by 600 million gallons to 15.0 billion gallons in 2015 through 2022, with no specified volumesubsequent to 2022. The EPA has the authority to assign the mandated amounts of renewable fuels to be blended into transportationfuel to individual fuel blenders. RFS II has been a primary factor in the growth of ethanol usage. Over the past several yearsvarious pieces of legislation have been introduced to the U.S. Congress that were intended to reduce or eliminate ethanol blendingrequirements. To date, none of the bills have been successful but they are an indication of the continued effort to undermine theEISA.Under EISA, the EPA has the authorityto waive or modify the mandated RFS II requirements in whole or in part. In order to grant a waiver, the EPA administrator mustdetermine in consultation with the Secretaries of Agriculture and Energy, that one of the following two conditions has been met:i) there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply or ii) implementation of the requirement would severely harm the economyor environment of a state, region or the country. In certain past years the EPA has taken action to reduce the mandated gallonscalled for under EISA for both conventional and advanced renewable fuels.13 Pursuant to RFS II, if mandatory renewablefuel volumes are reduced by at least 20% for two consecutive years, the EPA is required to modify, or reset, statutory volumesthrough 2022. While conventional ethanol was maintained at 15 billion gallons, 2019 was the second consecutive year the total proposedRVOs was more than 20% below statutory volumes levels. The EPA Administrator directed his staff to initiate the reset rulemakingprocess. However, the EPA has announced it will not move forward with a reset rulemaking in 2020.Obligated parties use renewable identificationnumbers (“RINs”) to show compliance with RFS-mandated volumes. RINs are attached to renewable fuels by producers anddetached when the renewable fuel is blended with transportation fuel or traded in the open market. The market price of detachedRINs affects the price of ethanol in certain markets and influences the purchasing decisions by obligated parties. As a resultof fluctuations in RINs pricing, certain obligated parties have petitioned the EPA and filed court actions to change the pointof obligation or to seek relief from their obligation. The EPA has granted 85 total SRWs for 2016 through 2018 totaling approximately4.0 billion gallons. This action has led to reduced values for RINs and further action could decrease RIN values and ethanol pricing.As of February 21, 2020, there were 23 SRWs pending for compliance year 2019. In a decision that could impact the granting of SRW’s,the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit recently vacated decisions by the EPA to extend exemptions to renewablefuel obligations to three small refineries. The refineries appealed this ruling.At the same time the EPA took action(in 2019) to allow the RVP waiver for E-15 for the summer months, it also took RIN market reform action. The reform action requirespublic disclosure when RIN holdings exceed specified thresholds by an entity and requires the reporting of additional price andaffiliate data to the EPA.If the United States were to withdrawfrom or materially modify certain international trade agreements, our business, financial condition and results of operations couldbe materially adversely affected. Ethanol and other products that we produce are sold into various other countries with trade agreementswith the United States. If tariffs were raised on the foreign-sourced goods that lead to retaliatory actions, it could have materialadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The inability to generate or obtainRINs could adversely affect our operating results. Virtually all of our ethanol is sold with RINs that are used by customersto comply with RFS II. If our production does not meet EPA requirements for RIN generation in the future, we would have to purchaseRINs in the open market or sell our ethanol at substantially lower prices to adjust for the absence of RINs. The price of RINsvaries based on many factors and cannot be predicted. Failure to obtain sufficient RINS or reliance on invalid RINs could subjectus to fines and penalties imposed by the EPA.Changes in corporate average fueleconomy standards could adversely impact ethanol prices. Flexible fuel vehicles receive preferential treatment in meetingfederally mandated corporate average fuel economy (“CAFE”) standards for automobiles manufactured by car makers. Highblend ethanol fuels such as E-85 result in lower fuel efficiencies. Absent the CAFE preferences, car makers would not likely buildflexible-fuel vehicles. Any change in CAFE preferences could reduce the growth of E-85 markets and result in lower ethanol prices.Various studies havecriticized the efficiency of ethanol, in general, and corn-based ethanol in particular, which could lead to the reduction or repealof incentives and tariffs that promote the use and domestic production of ethanol or otherwise negatively impact public perceptionand acceptance of ethanol as an alternative fuel. Although many trade groups, academicsand governmental agencies have supported ethanol as a fuel additive that promotes a cleaner environment, others have criticizedethanol production as consuming considerably more energy and emitting more greenhouse gases than other biofuels and as potentiallydepleting water resources. Other studies have suggested that corn-based ethanol is less efficient than ethanol produced from switchgrassor wheat grain and that it negatively impacts consumers by causing prices for dairy, meat and other foodstuffs from livestock thatconsume corn to increase.14 If these views gain acceptance, supportfor existing measures promoting use and domestic production of corn-based ethanol could decline, leading to reduction or repealof these measures. These views could also negatively impact public perception of the ethanol industry and acceptance of ethanolas an alternative fuel.Federal support of cellulosic ethanolmay result in reduced incentives to corn-derived ethanol producers. The American Recoveryand Reinvestment Act of 2009 and EISA provide funding opportunities in support of cellulosic ethanol obtained from biomass sourcessuch as switchgrass and poplar trees. The amended RFS mandates an increasing level of production of non-corn-derived biofuels.These federal policies may suggest a long-term political preference for cellulosic processes using alternative feedstocks suchas switchgrass, silage or wood chips. Cellulosic ethanol has a smaller carbon footprint than corn-derived ethanol and is unlikelyto divert foodstuff from the market. Several cellulosic ethanol plants are under development and there is a risk that cellulosicethanol could displace corn ethanol. Our plants are designed as single-feedstock facilities, located in corn production areas withlimited alternative feedstock nearby, and would require significant additional investment to convert to the production of cellulosicethanol. The adoption of cellulosic ethanol as the preferred form of ethanol could have a significant adverse effect on our ethanolbusiness.Our ethanol business is affected by environmental and other regulationswhich could impede or prohibit our ability to successfully operate our plants.Our ethanol productionfacilities are subject to extensive air, water and other environmental regulations. We have had to obtain numerous permits to constructand operate our plants. Regulatory agencies could impose conditions or other restrictions in the permits that are detrimental,or which increase our costs. More stringent federal or state environmental regulations could be adopted which could significantlyincrease our operating costs or require us to expend considerable resources.Our ethanol plants emitvarious airborne pollutants as by-products of the ethanol production process, including carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas). In 2007,the U.S. Supreme Court classified carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act in a case seeking to require the EPAto regulate carbon dioxide in vehicle emissions. In February 2010, the EPA released its final regulations on the Renewable FuelStandard program. We believe our plants are grandfathered up to certain operating capacity, but recent plant expansion requiresus to meet a 20% threshold reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from a 2005 baseline measurement to produce ethanol eligiblefor the RFS II mandate. To further expand our plant capacity, we may be required to obtain additional permits, install advancedtechnology equipment, or reduce drying of certain amounts of distillers grains. We may also be required to install carbon dioxidemitigation equipment or take other steps in order to comply with future laws or regulations. Compliance with future laws or regulationsof carbon dioxide, or if we choose to expand capacity at certain of our plants, compliance with then-current regulations of carbondioxide, could be costly and may prevent us from operating our plants as profitably, which may have a negative impact on our financialperformance. We also face the risk of ethanol production above our grandfathered capacity not qualifying for RINS if the plantsdo not meet certain emission requirements.The California Air ResourcesBoard (""CARB"") has adopted a Low Carbon Fuel Standard (""LCFS"") requiring a 10% reduction in GHG emissions fromtransportation fuels by 2020. An Indirect Land Use Charge is included in this lifecycle GHG emission calculation. After a seriesof rulings that temporarily prevented CARB from enforcing these regulations, the State of California Office of Administrative Lawapproved the LCFS on November 26, 2012 and revised LCFS regulations took effect in January 2013. This standard could have an adverseimpact on the market for corn-based ethanol in California if corn-based ethanol fails to achieve lifecycle GHG emission reductions.This could have a negative impact on our financial performance.15 Our ethanol business may become subject to various environmentaland health and safety and property damage claims and liabilities. Operation of our ethanolbusiness exposes the business to the risk of environmental and health and safety claims and property damage claims, such as failureto comply with environmental regulations. These types of claims could also be made against our ethanol business based upon theacts or omissions of other persons. Serious claims could have a material negative impact on our results of operations, financialposition and future cash flows.Our business is notdiversified. Our financial resultsdepend heavily on our ability to operate our ethanol plants profitably. Our lack of diversification could have a material negativeimpact on our results of operations, financial position and future cash flows should our ethanol plants operate unprofitably.We may have commitmentsto produce and sell ethanol.We may, at times, sellour products with forward contracts. If we are unable to produce the products due to economic conditions, business interruption,or other factors, we may incur additional costs or have to obtain commodities at unfavorable prices to meet our contractual commitments.This could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We may have commitmentsto purchase commodities.We may, at times, purchasecertain commodities with forward contracts without a corresponding quantity of ethanol sold via forward contracts at known prices.Should ethanol and by-product prices decline to levels that would lead to significant unprofitable results of operations, we mayincur additional costs and/or losses to meet our contractual commitments. This could have a material adverse effect on our resultsof operations.Our revenue from thesale of distillers grains depends upon its continued market acceptance as an animal feed.Distillers grains isa by-product from the fermentation of corn to produce ethanol. Antibiotics may be used during the fermentation process to controlbacterial contamination; therefore, antibiotics may be present in small quantities in distillers grains marketed as animal feed.The U. S. Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Veterinary Medicine has expressed concern about potential animal andhuman health hazards from the use of distillers grains as an animal feed due to the possibility of antibiotic residues. If thepublic became concerned about the impact of distillers grains in the food supply or as an acceptable animal feed, the market fordistillers grains could be negatively impacted, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. We may not beable to obtain a suitable replacement for antibiotics, should this be required, which would also negatively impact the market fordistillers grains.An estimated 30% of distillersgrains produced in the United States were exported in 2019. The price of distillers grains has benefitted from the exports of theproduct. In recent years, certain countries have refused to import U.S. distillers grains for a variety of reasons. If export shipmentsare rejected or delayed, the market price for distillers grains would be negatively impacted, which would have a negative impacton our ethanol results of operations.16 We extract non-food gradecorn oil immediately prior to the production of distillers grains. Several studies are attempting to determine whether non-foodgrade corn oil extraction may impact the nutritional value of the resulting distillers grains. If it is determined that non-foodgrade corn oil extraction adversely impacts the nutritional energy content of distillers grains, the value of the distillers grainswe sell may be negatively impacted, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations.We face significantcompetition in the ethanol industry.We face significantcompetition for new ethanol investment opportunities. There are varied enterprises seeking to participate in the ethanol industry.Some enterprises provide financial and management support similar to our business model. Other enterprises seek to acquire or developplants which they will directly own and operate. Many of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources and namerecognition than we do. We must compete for investment opportunities based on our strategy of supporting and enhancing local developmentof ethanol plant opportunities. We may not be successful in competing for investment opportunities based on our strategy.The ethanol industryis primarily comprised of entities that engage exclusively in ethanol production and large integrated grain companies that produceethanol along with their base grain business. Several large oil companies have entered the ethanol production market. If thesecompanies increase their ethanol plant ownership or if other oil companies seek to engage in direct ethanol production, there wouldbe less of a need to purchase ethanol from independent producers such as our ethanol plants. No assurance can be given that ourethanol plants will be able to compete successfully or that competition from larger companies with greater financial resourceswill not have a materially adverse impact on the results of our ethanol operations.We may face competitionfrom foreign producers.There is a riskof foreign competition in the ethanol industry. Brazil is presently the second largest producer of ethanol in the world. Brazil'sethanol production is sugarcane based, and, depending on feedstock prices, may be cheaper to produce than corn-derived ethanol.Under the RFS, certain parties were obligated to meet an advanced biofuel standard. In recent years, sugarcane based ethanol importedfrom Brazil has been one of the most economical means for obligated parties to comply with this standard.If significant additionalforeign ethanol production capacity is created, such facilities could create excess supplies of ethanol, which may result in lowerprices of ethanol. In addition, foreign ethanol producers may be able to produce ethanol at costs lower than ours. These riskscould have significant adverse effects on our financial performance.We are exposedto credit risk from our sales of ethanol and distillers grains to customers.The inability ofa customer to make payments to us for our accounts receivable may cause us to experience losses and may adversely impact our liquidityand our ability to make our payments when due.We may not beable to hire and retain qualified personnel to operate our ethanol plants.Our ability to attractand retain competent personnel has a significant impact on operating efficiencies and plant profitability. Competition for keyplant employees in the ethanol industry can be intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees. Failureto do so could have a negative impact on our financial results at individual plants.17 Our plants depend on an uninterrupted supply of energy and waterto operate. Unforeseen plant shutdowns could harm our business. Our plants require a significant and uninterruptedsupply of natural gas, electricity and water to operate. We generally rely on third parties to provide these resources. If thereis an interruption in the supply of energy or water for any reason, such as supply, delivery or mechanical problems and we areunable to secure an adequate alternative supply to sustain plant operations, we may be required to stop production. A productionhalt for an extended period of time could result in material losses. Potential business disruption from factorsoutside our control, including natural disasters, severe weather conditions, accidents, strikes, unexpected equipment failuresand unforeseen plant shutdowns, could adversely affect our cash flow and operating results. The debt agreements for certain of the ethanolplants limit, or otherwise restrict the amount of dividends and other payments the ethanol subsidiaries can transfer to their members. We are dependent on dividends from our ethanolsubsidiaries to generate cash flow. Presently our unconsolidated ethanol subsidiary has debt agreements that limit payments tomembers. Therefore, this company cannot distribute all of the cash it generates to its members. Furthermore, we may not be ableto use the excess cash flow from one subsidiary to fund corporate needs or needs of another operating ethanol subsidiary. We rely on information technology in ouroperations and financial reporting and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security breach of that technology couldharm our ability to efficiently operate our business and report our financial results accurately and timely. We rely heavily on information technology systemsacross our operations, including for management of inventory, purchase orders, production, invoices, shipping, accounting and variousother processes and transactions. Our ability to effectively manage our business, coordinate the production, distribution and saleof our products and ensure the timely and accurate recording and disclosure of financial information depends significantly on thereliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning toupgraded or replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems through a cyber-attack or otherwise could cause delaysand/or interruptions in plant operations, product sales, reduced efficiency of our operations and delays in reporting our financialresults. Significant capital investments could be required to remediate any such problem. Security breaches of employee informationor other confidential or proprietary data could also adversely impact our reputation and could result in litigation against usor the imposition of penalties. We are exposed to potential businessdisruption from factors outside our control, including natural disasters, severe weather conditions, accidents, pandemic diseasesand unforeseen operational failures any of which could negatively affect our transportation operations and could adversely affectour cash flows and operating results. Potentialbusiness disruption in available transportation due to natural disasters, severe weather conditions, the outbreak of a pandemicdisease, significant track damage resulting from a train derailment, strikes or other interruptions by our transportation providerscould result in delays in procuring and supplying raw materials to our ethanol facilities, or transporting ethanol and distillersgrains to our customers. Such business disruptions may result in our inability to meet customer demand or contract delivery requirements,as well as the potential loss of customers.18  Rail cars used to transport ethanol mayneed to be modified or replaced to meet proposed rail safety regulations. The leased rail cars we use to transport ethanolto market will need to be retrofitted or replaced as the Enhanced Tank Car Standards and Operation Controls for High-Hazard FlammableTrains adopted by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) imposes an enhanced tank car standard known as theDOT specification 117 and establishes a schedule to retrofit or replace older tank cars that carry crude oil and ethanol. The rulealso establishes braking standards intended to reduce the severity of accidents and new operational protocols. This could leadto increased rail car lease costs and delays in transportation of ethanol if rail cars are out of service for extended periodsof time. We operate in a capital intensiveindustry. Limitations on external financing could adversely affect our financial performance.We may need to incur additional financing tofund growth of our business or in times of increasing liquidity requirements (such as increases in raw material costs). Bankruptcyfilings by several ethanol companies in past years and capital market volatility has reduced available capital for the ethanolindustry. Any delays in obtaining additional financing, or our inability to do so, could have a material adverse impact on ourfinancial results. Risks Related to our Refined Coal Operations During the early months of 2020,a new strain of COVID-19 spread into the United States and other countries.In an effort to contain the spreadof this virus, there have been various government mandated restrictions, in addition to voluntary privately implemented restrictions,including limiting public gatherings, retail store closures, restrictions on employees working and the quarantining of people whomay have been exposed to the virus. The duration of the resulting downturn in economic activity is unknown both on a macro anda micro level. This could lead to prolonged production stoppages or interruptions at our refined coal plant and could result inan adverse material impact on the results of operations and on our financial position.Our refined coal investment is subject to various risks and uncertainties.We purchased a company that produces refined coal that we believe qualifies to earn tax credits under IRC Section 45 throughNovember 2021. Our ability to generate returns and avoid write-offs in connection with this investment is subject to various risksand uncertainties. These include, but are not limited to, the risks and uncertainties as set forth below.Availability of the tax credits under IRC Section 45. Our ability to claim tax credits under IRCSection 45 depends upon the operation which we have purchased satisfying certain ongoing conditions set forth in IRC Section 45.Furthermore, the tax credits under IRC Section 45 could be reduced or eliminated as a result of changes in income tax laws and/orregulations. The IRS could ultimately determine that therefined coal facility we purchased and/or its operations have not satisfied, or have not continued to satisfy, the conditions setforth in IRC Section 45. As our refined coal operation is expected to generate pre-tax losses, the unavailability of the tax creditsfor any reason could have a material impact on our results of operations. 19 IRC Section 45 phase out provisions. IRC Section 45 contains phase out provisionsbased upon the market price of coal such that, if the price of coal rises to specified levels, we could lose some or all of thetax credits we expect to receive from this operation.The refined coal operation depends on one customer. The refined coal operation receives tax creditsby selling its refined coal to an unrelated party. The unrelated party is not obligated to continue purchasing refined coal fromus. Our user of refined coal could convert its fuel source to natural gas, oil or some other source instead of coal depending onthe price of natural gas, oil or other sources relative to that of coal. If the unrelated party ceases to purchase refined coalfrom us, we would attempt to move our refined coal plant to a different location, which could require us to invest additional capital,or to find a different user to purchase our refined coal. In addition, we may not be able to find a suitable location to move ourrefined coal plant to or find a different user to purchase our refined coal in a timely manner, given that we only intend to operatethe refined coal plant until November 2021. Market demand for coal may also decline as a result of an economic slowdown. Sustainedlow natural gas prices may also cause users of coal to phase out or close existing coal using operations. If users of coal burnless coal or eliminate the use of coal, there would be less need for our product. A reduction or cessation of refined coal salescould have a material impact on our results of operations. Environmental concerns regarding coal could lead to reduced or suspended refined coal operations.  Environmental concerns about greenhouse gases,toxic wastewater discharges and the potentially hazardous nature of coal combustion waste could lead to regulations that discouragethe burning of coal. Such regulations could mandate that electric power generating companies purchase a minimum amount of powerfrom renewable energy sources such as wind, hydroelectric, solar and geothermal. This could result in utilities burning less coal,which could have a material impact on our results of operations. The refined coal operation in which we have invested and theby-products from such operations may result in environmental and product liability claims and environmental compliance costs. The construction and operation of refined coaloperations are subject to Federal, state and local laws, regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to theprotection or preservation of the environment, natural resources and human health and safety. Such laws and regulations generallyrequire the operations and/or the utilities at which the operations are located to obtain and comply with various environmentalregistrations, licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Such laws and regulations also impose liability, without regardto fault or the legality of a party’s conduct, on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to, or are otherwiseinvolved in, the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment. Such hazardous substances could bereleased as a result of burning refined coal in a number of ways, including air emissions, wastewater, and by-products such asfly ash. One party may, under certain circumstances, be required to bear more than its share or the entire share of investigationand cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtained from other responsible parties. We may be exposed tothe risk of becoming liable for environmental damage we may have had little, if any, involvement in creating. Such risk remainseven after production ceases at an operation to the extent the environmental damage can be traced to the types of chemicals orcompounds used or operations conducted in connection with the use of refined coal. No assurances can be given that contractualarrangements and precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators will result in that facilityowner or operator accepting full responsibility for any environmental damage. It is also not uncommon for private claims by thirdparties alleging contamination to also include claims for personal injury, property damage, diminution of property or similar claims.Furthermore, many environmental, health and safety laws authorize citizen suits,permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits and force compliance. Our insurance20 may not cover allenvironmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of an environmental claim. If significant uninsuredlosses arise from environmental damage or product liability claims, or if the costs of environmental compliance increase for anyreason, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. We rely on a third party to operate the refined coal facility. We rely on an unrelated third party to operatethe refined coal plant. Should the third party fail to perform or underperform in the operation, management or regulatory complianceof the facility, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected as we are not experienced in operatinga refined coal facility. We will have to generate taxable incometo utilize the Section 45 federal production tax credits. If we do not generate sufficient taxable incometo utilize the tax credits earned by our refined coal operation, we could incur write-offs of the related tax attributes whichcould adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, this could adversely reduce our liquidityreserves as we expect to incur operating losses sustained by the refined coal operation. Risks Related to our eSteam investment eSteam may not be a commercially viabletechnology. During fiscal year 2013, we invested in eSteam,a new technology utilizing steam to extract deep heavy oil. Cumulatively, we have paid and expensed approximately $2.4 millionon this patented but unproven technology. To date, we have not tested or proven the viability of the technology. In addition, lowenergy and crude oil prices may make eSteam technology less attractive to potential users. If we cannot demonstrate that the technologyis commercially feasible, we may incur additional losses. eSteam testing methods and results are notknown. We do not have specific testing methodologiesor specifications developed for testing the viability of the eSteam technology. The actual eSteam testing process could resultin injury to others, and property and other damages that could expose us to claims for damages from unrelated parties. Our eSteam technology may be subject topatent challenges. If our patents of the eSteam technology arechallenged, we could be required to spend considerable time and resources defending our patents. Operations utilizing our eSteam technologymay be subject to stringent environmental regulations. Use of the eSteam technology will require significantamounts of water and energy. If we or third parties are unable to obtain the proper permits and sources of water and energy, thenwe may not be able to commercialize the new technology, and thus, generate any revenue from our investment. Operations utilizing our eSteam technologymay cause environmental damage. When testing and operating the eSteam technology,we may cause environmental damage, as we would be injecting water and other fluids into the ground to generate underground steamin order to extract oil. We could be subject to significant penalties and fines if we were to cause environmental damage.21  Risks Related to REX and non-industry specificmatters Given the amount of our cash andshort-term investments, recent actions by the Federal Reserve, related to the COVID-19 outbreak, which have reduced interest ratesand could significantly reduce our interest income in future periods.Depending on the length of time interestrates remain at these levels, this could result in an adverse material impact on the results of operations and on our financialposition.We have concentrations of cash depositsat financial institutions that exceed federal insurance limits.  We generally have cash deposits that exceedfederal insurance limits. Should the financial institutions we deposit our cash in experience insolvency or other financial difficulty,our access to cash deposits could be limited. In extreme cases, we could lose our cash deposits entirely. This would negativelyimpact our liquidity and results of operations. We may fail to realize the anticipated benefitsof mergers, acquisitions, or other investments. We intend to continue seeking growth opportunities.Acquisitions and similar transactions involve many risks that could harm our business, which include:·The anticipated benefits of these transactions may not be fully realized, or take longer to realizethan expected,    ·Future acquisitions could result in operating losses or loss of investment, and    ·Future acquisitions may involve incurring debt to complete these transactions, which could havea material adverse effect on our financial condition. Federal, state and local jurisdictions maychallenge our tax return positions. We use significant judgments, estimates andinterpretation and application of complex tax laws in preparing the tax returns we file, and the positions contained therein. Webelieve that our tax return positions are fully supportable. However, certain positions may be successfully challenged by federal,state and local jurisdictions. This could result in material additional income tax payments we would have to make and higher incometax expense in future periods. "
10,REX,REX AMERICAN RESOURCES CORP,2019-03-29,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
 We encourage you to carefully considerthe risks described below and other information contained in this report when considering an investment decision in REX commonstock. Any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If one or more of these events do occur, our results ofoperations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In this instance, the trading price of REXstock could decline, and investors might lose all or part of their investment.8Risks Related to our Ethanol and by-ProductsBusiness The ethanol industry is changing rapidlywhich could result in unexpected developments that could negatively impact our operations. According to the RFA, the ethanol industryhas grown from approximately 1.5 billion gallons of domestic annual ethanol production in 1999 to approximately 16.1 billion gallonsin 2018. Thus, there have been significant changes in the supply and demand of ethanol over a relatively short period of time whichcould lead to difficulty in maintaining profitable operations at our ethanol plants. The financial returns on our ethanolinvestments are highly dependent on commodity prices, which are subject to significant volatility, uncertainty and regional supplyshortages, so our results could fluctuate substantially. The financial returnson our ethanol investments are highly dependent on commodity prices, especially prices for corn, natural gas, ethanol, dried distillersgrains, non-food grade corn oil and unleaded gasoline. As a result of the volatility of the prices for these items, our returnsmay fluctuate substantially and our investments could experience periods of declining prices for their products and increasingcosts for their raw materials, which could result in operating losses at our ethanol plants. Our returns onethanol investments are highly sensitive to grain prices. Corn is the principal raw material our ethanol plants use toproduce ethanol and co-products. As a result, changes in the price of corn can significantly affect our businesses. Rising cornprices result in higher production costs of ethanol and co-products. Because ethanol competes with non-corn-based fuels, our ethanolplants may not be able to pass along increased grain costs to our customers. At certain levels, grain prices may make ethanol uneconomicalto produce. The price of corn isinfluenced by weather conditions and other factors affecting crop yields, transportation costs, farmer planting decisions, exports,the value of the U.S. dollar and general economic, market and regulatory factors. These factors include government policies andsubsidies with respect to agriculture and international trade and global and local demand and supply. The significance and relativeeffect of these factors on the price of corn is difficult to predict. Any event that tends to negatively affect the supply of corn,such as adverse weather or crop disease, could increase corn prices and potentially harm the business of our ethanol plants. Increasingdomestic ethanol capacity could boost the demand for corn and result in increased corn prices. Much of the Midwestern United Statesexperienced drought conditions during 2012 which led to a smaller harvest of corn and increased corn prices. Our ethanol plantsmay also have difficulty, from time to time, in physically sourcing corn on economic terms due to regional supply shortages, transportationissues, or unfavorable local pricing. Such a shortage or price impact could require our ethanol plants to suspend operations whichwould have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. The spread betweenethanol and corn prices can vary significantly. The gross margin at our ethanol plants depends principally on the spreadbetween ethanol and corn prices. Fluctuations in the spread are likely to continue to occur. A sustained narrow or negative spread,whether as a result of sustained high or increased corn prices or sustained low or decreased ethanol prices, would adversely affectthe results of operations at our ethanol plants. Our risk managementstrategies may be ineffective and may expose us to decreased profitability and liquidity. In an attempt to partially offsetthe impact of volatility of commodity prices, we enter into forward contracts to sell a portion of our ethanol and distillers grainsproduction and to purchase a portion of our corn and natural gas requirements. The financial impact of these risk management activitiesis dependent upon,9among other items, theprices involved and our ability to receive or deliver the commodities involved. Risk management activities can result in financialloss when positions are purchased in a declining market or when positions are sold in an increasing market. In addition, we maynot be able to match the appropriate quantity of corn contracts with quantities of ethanol, distillers grains and non-food gradecorn oil contracts. We vary the amount of risk management techniques we utilize, and we may choose not to engage in any risk managementactivities. Should we fail to properly manage the inherent volatility of commodities prices, our results of operations and financialcondition may be adversely affected. The market fornatural gas is subject to market conditions that create uncertainty in the price and availability of the natural gas that our ethanolplants use in their manufacturing process. Our ethanol plants rely upon third parties for their supply of natural gas,which is consumed as fuel in the production process. The prices for and availability of natural gas are subject to volatile marketconditions. These market conditions often are affected by factors beyond the ethanol plants’ control, such as weather conditions,overall economic conditions and foreign and domestic governmental regulation and relations. Significant disruptions in the supplyof natural gas could impair or completely prevent the ethanol plants’ ability to economically manufacture ethanol for theircustomers. Furthermore, increases in natural gas prices or changes in our natural gas costs relative to natural gas costs paidby competitors may adversely affect results of operations and financial position at our ethanol plants. Fluctuations in the selling priceof commodities may reduce profit margins at our ethanol plants. Ethanol is marketed as a fuel additive to reduce vehicleemissions from gasoline, as an octane enhancer to improve the octane rating of gasoline with which it is blended and, to a lesserextent, as a gasoline substitute. As a result, ethanol prices are influenced by the supply and demand for gasoline and our ethanolplants’ results of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected if gasoline demand or prices decrease. Distillers grains compete with other proteinbased animal feed products. The price of distillers grains may decrease when the prices of competing feed products decrease. Theprices of competing animal feed products are based in part on the prices of the commodities from which their products are made.Historically, sales prices for distillers grains have tracked along with the price of corn. However, there have been instanceswhen the price increase for distillers grains has lagged price increases in corn prices. The production of distillers grains hasincreased as a result of increases in dry mill ethanol production in the United States. This could lead to price declines in whatwe can sell our distillers grains for in the future. Such declines could have an adverse material effect on our results of operations. Increased ethanolproduction or decreases in demand for ethanol may result in excess production capacity in the ethanol industry, which may causethe price of ethanol, distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil to decrease. According to the RFA,domestic ethanol production capacity is approximately 16.5 billion gallons per year as of January 2019. The RFA estimates that,as of January 2019, approximately 350 million gallons per year of additional production capacity is under construction or expansion.Certain operating plants have qualified as efficient ethanol producers through the EPA pathway assessment, and are expanding, orplanning to expand their capacity. The EPA set the RFS requirement to be satisfied by corn-derived ethanol at 15.0 billion gallonsfor 2018 and 2019. However, the RFS requirements have been reduced through small refiner waivers issued by the EPA. These waiverswere in the amount of approximately 2.6 billion gallons of ethanol for 2016 and 2017 combined. There have been no rulings on waiverrequests for subsequent years. Excess capacity in the ethanol industry could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations.In a manufacturing industry with excess capacity, producers have an incentive to manufacture additional products for so long asthe price exceeds the marginal cost of production (i.e., the cost of producing only the next unit, without regard for10interest, overhead orfixed costs). This incentive could result in the reduction of the market price of ethanol to a level that is inadequate to generatesufficient cash flow to cover costs. Excess capacity may alsoresult from decreases in the demand for ethanol, which could result from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, regulatorydevelopments and reduced U.S. gasoline consumption. Reduced gasoline consumption could occur as a result of increased prices forgasoline or crude oil, which could cause businesses and consumers to reduce driving or acquire vehicles with more favorable gasolinemileage or acquire non-gasoline powered vehicles. In addition, becauseethanol production produces distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil as co-products, increased ethanol production will alsolead to increased supplies of distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil. An increase in the supply of distillers grains andnon-food grade corn oil, without corresponding increases in demand, could lead to lower prices or an inability to sell our ethanolplants’ distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil production. A decline in the price of distillers grains or non-foodgrade corn oil could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations. The price of ethanol and distillersgrains may decline as a result of trade restrictions or duties on ethanol and distillers grains exports from the United Statesor from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. The United States exported approximately1.7 billion gallons of ethanol in 2018. If producers and exporters of ethanol are subject to trade restrictions, or additionalduties are imposed on exports, it may make it uneconomical to export ethanol. Brazil, China and the European Union all have tradebarriers or tariffs against U.S. fuel ethanol. In 2013, the European Union imposed a five year tariff of $83.33 per metric tonon U.S. fuel ethanol to discourage foreign competition. Effective January 1, 2017, China indicated its intention to raise its 5%tariff on U.S. and Brazil fuel ethanol to 30%. On April 1, 2018, China raised their tariff rate to 45%, and later raised it to70% in the U.S. and China trade war. On September 1, 2017, Brazil imposed a 20% tariff on U.S. fuel ethanol imports in excess of150 million liters, or 39.6 million gallons per quarter. The tariff is valid for two years. Furthermore, unfavorable changes inforeign currency exchange rates could reduce the demand for United States ethanol exports. This could result in an oversupply ofethanol in the United States which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations. Exports of distillers grains produced inthe United States have been increasing in recent years. In 2018, approximately 12.1 million metric tons (“mmt”) wereexported of the approximately 41.3 mmt produced in the U.S. However, the export market may be jeopardized if foreign governmentsimpose trade barriers or other measures to protect the foreign local markets. The Chinese export market became less than 2% ofglobal shipments in 2018 due to punitive tariffs established beginning January 2017 in effect for 5 years per the RFA. If producersand exporters of distillers grains are subjected to trade barriers when selling distillers grains to foreign customers, there maybe a reduction in the price of distillers grains in the United States. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuationscould reduce the demand for United States exports of distillers grains. Declines in the price we receive for our distillers grainscould lead to decreased revenues and may result in our inability to operate our ethanol plants profitably. Future demand for ethanol is uncertainand changes in overall consumer demand for transportation fuel could affect demand. There are limited markets for ethanol otherthat what is federally mandated. Increased consumer acceptance of E15 and E85 fuel is likely necessary in order for ethanol toachieve significant market share growth beyond federal mandate levels.11We depend on our partners to operatecertain of our ethanol investments. Our investments currently represent bothmajority and minority equity positions. Day-to-day operating control of minority owned plants generally remains with the localinvestor group. We do not have the ability to directly modify the operations of these plants in response to changes in the businessenvironment or in response to any deficiencies in local operations of the plants. In addition, local plant operators, who alsorepresent the primary suppliers of corn and other crops to the plants, may have interests, such as the price and sourcing of cornand other crops, that may differ from our interest, which is based solely on the operating profit of the plant. The limitationson our ability to control day-to-day plant operations could adversely affect plant results of operations. We may not successfully acquire or developadditional ethanol investments. The growth of our ethanolbusiness depends on our ability to identify and develop new ethanol investments. Our ethanol development strategy depends on referrals,and introductions, to new investment opportunities from industry participants, such as ethanol plant builders, financial institutions,marketing agents and others. We must continue to maintain favorable relationships with these industry participants, and a materialdisruption in these sources of referrals would adversely affect our ability to expand our ethanol investments. Any expansion strategywill depend on prevailing market conditions for the price of ethanol and the cost of corn and natural gas and the expectationsof future market conditions. There is increasing competition for suitable sites for ethanol plants. Even if suitable sites or opportunitiesare identified, we may not be able to secure the services and products from contractors, engineering firms, construction firmsand equipment suppliers necessary to build or expand ethanol plants on a timely basis or on acceptable economic terms. Constructioncosts may increase to levels that would make a new plant too expensive to complete or unprofitable to operate. Additional financingmay also be necessary to implement any expansion strategy, which may not be accessible or available on acceptable terms. New andmore stringent environmental regulations could increase the operating costs and risks of new plants, which, in turn could discourageus from further expansion. In addition, failure to adequately manage the risks associated with additional ethanol investments couldhave a material adverse effect on our business. Our ethanol plants may be adverselyaffected by technological advances and efforts to anticipate and employ such technological advances may prove unsuccessful. The development and implementation of newtechnologies may result in a significant reduction in the costs of ethanol production. For instance, any technological advancesin the efficiency or cost to produce ethanol from inexpensive cellulosic sources such as corn stalk, wheat, oat or barley strawcould have an adverse effect on our ethanol plants, because our plants are designed to produce ethanol from corn, which is, bycomparison, a raw material with other high value uses. We cannot predict when new technologies may become available, the rate ofacceptance of new technologies by competitors or the costs associated with new technologies. In addition, advances in the developmentof alternatives to ethanol could significantly reduce demand for or eliminate the need for ethanol. Any advances in technology which requiresignificant unanticipated capital expenditures to remain competitive or which reduce demand or prices for ethanol would have amaterial adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations. In addition, alternative fuels, additivesand oxygenates are continually under development. Alternative fuel additives that can replace ethanol may be developed, which maydecrease the demand for ethanol. It is also possible that technological advances in engine and exhaust system design and performancecould reduce the use of oxygenates, which would lower the demand for ethanol, and the results of our ethanol operations may bematerially adversely affected.12The U.S. ethanol industry is highlydependent upon a myriad of federal and state legislation and regulation and any changes in legislation or regulation could materiallyand adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. The Energy Independence and Security Actof 2007 (EISA) established RFS II, which modified the renewable fuel standard from prior legislation. EISA increased the amountof renewable fuel required to be blended into gasoline and required a minimum usage of corn-derived renewable fuels of 12.0 billiongallons in 2010, increasing annually by 600 million gallons to 15.0 billion gallons in 2015 through 2022, with no specified volumesubsequent to 2022. The EPA has the authority to assign the mandated amounts of renewable fuels to be blended into transportationfuel to individual fuel blenders. RFS II has been a primary factor in the growth of ethanol usage. Over the past several yearsvarious pieces of legislation have been introduced to the U.S. Congress that were intended to reduce or eliminate ethanol blendingrequirements. To date, none of the bills have been successful but they are an indication of the continued effort to undermine theEISA. For example, on January 3, 2017, the Leave Ethanol Volumes at Existing Levels (“LEVEL”) Act (H.R. 119) was introducedin the U.S. House of Representatives. The bill would freeze renewable fuel blending requirements under the RFS at 7.5 billion gallonsper year, prohibit the sale of gasoline containing more than 10% ethanol, and revoke the EPA’s approval of E15 blends. Inaddition, on January 31, 2017, a bill (H.R. 777) was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives that would require the EPAand National Academies of Sciences to conduct a study on the implication of the use of mid-level ethanol blends. A mid-level ethanolblend is an ethanol gasoline blend containing 10-20% ethanol by volume, including E15 and E20, that is intended to be used in anyconventional gasoline powered motor vehicle or non-road vehicle or engine. On March 2, 2017, a bill (H.R. 1315) was introducedin the U.S. House of Representatives that would limit the volume of ethanol in gasoline to 10%. On the same day, the RFS EliminationAct (H.R. 1314) was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives. The bill would fully repeal the RFS. Under EISA, the EPA has the authority towaive or modify the mandated RFS II requirements in whole or in part. In order to grant a waiver, the EPA administrator must determinein consultation with the Secretaries of Agriculture and Energy, that one of the following two conditions has been met: i) thereis inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply or ii) implementation of the requirement would severely harm the economy or environmentof a state, region or the country. In certain past years the EPA has taken action to reduce the mandated gallons called for underEISA for both conventional and advanced renewable fuels. Pursuant to RFS II, if mandatory renewablefuel volumes are reduced by at least 20% for two consecutive years, the EPA is required to modify, or reset, statutory volumesthrough 2022. While conventional ethanol was maintained at 15 billion gallons, 2019 is the second consecutive year the total proposedRVOs are more than 20% below statutory volumes levels. Thus, the EPA Administrator directed his staff to initiate the reset rulemakingprocess and the EPA will modify statutory volumes through 2022 based upon the same factors used to set the post 2022 RVOs. Thesefactors include environmental impact, domestic energy security, expected production, infrastructure, consumer costs, job creation,agriculture commodities, food prices and rural economic development. Obligated parties use renewable identificationnumbers (“RINs”) to show compliance with RFS-mandated volumes. RINs are attached to renewable fuels by producers anddetached when the renewable fuel is blended with transportation fuel or traded in the open market. The market price of detachedRINs affects the price of ethanol in certain markets and influences the purchasing decisions by obligated parties. As a resultof fluctuations in RINs pricing, certain obligated parties have petitioned the EPA and filed court actions to change the pointof obligation or to seek relief from their obligation. The EPA has granted small refiner waivers for 2016 and 2017 totaling approximately2.6 billion gallons. This action has already led to reduced values for RINs and further action could decrease RIN values and ethanolpricing.13In March 2019, the EPA sent reformmeasures to the White House to control speculation in RIN values by barring trading from non-industry participants, publicizinglarge RIN positions, limiting the length of time a non-obligated party can hold RINs and increasing the compliance frequency toquarterly rather than annually. This could provide for further uncertainty in RIN values. If the United States were to withdraw fromor materially modify the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) or certain other international trade agreements,our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Ethanol and other productsthat we produce are sold into Canada, Mexico and other countries with trade agreements with the United States. If tariffs wereraised on the foreign-sourced goods that lead to retaliatory actions, it could have material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition and results of operations. The inability to generate or obtainRINs could adversely affect our operating results. Virtually all of our ethanol is sold with RINs that are used by customersto comply with RFS II. If our production does not meet EPA requirements for RIN generation in the future, we would have to purchaseRINs in the open market or sell our ethanol at substantially lower prices to adjust for the absence of RINs. The price of RINsvaries based on many factors and cannot be predicted. Failure to obtain sufficient RINS or reliance on invalid RINs could subjectus to fines and penalties imposed by the EPA. Changes in corporate average fueleconomy standards could adversely impact ethanol prices. Flexible fuel vehicles receive preferential treatment in meetingfederally mandated corporate average fuel economy (“CAFE”) standards for automobiles manufactured by car makers. Highblend ethanol fuels such as E-85 result in lower fuel efficiencies. Absent the CAFE preferences, car makers would not likely buildflexible-fuel vehicles. Any change in CAFE preferences could reduce the growth of E-85 markets and result in lower ethanol prices. Various studies have criticized theefficiency of ethanol, in general, and corn-based ethanol in particular, which could lead to the reduction or repeal of incentivesand tariffs that promote the use and domestic production of ethanol or otherwise negatively impact public perception and acceptanceof ethanol as an alternative fuel. Although many trade groups, academics andgovernmental agencies have supported ethanol as a fuel additive that promotes a cleaner environment, others have criticized ethanolproduction as consuming considerably more energy and emitting more greenhouse gases than other biofuels and as potentially depletingwater resources. Other studies have suggested that corn-based ethanol is less efficient than ethanol produced from switchgrassor wheat grain and that it negatively impacts consumers by causing prices for dairy, meat and other foodstuffs from livestock thatconsume corn to increase. On February 22, 2019, the U.S. EPA publisheda notice in the Federal Register announcing a proposed consent decree that would require the agency to complete an anti-backslidingstudy on the RFS by March 30, 2020. A public comment period on the notice is open through March 25, 2019. According to informationreleased by the EPA, the anti-backsliding study will consider whether the renewable fuel volumes required under the RFS by theClean Air Act adversely impact air quality as a result of changes in vehicle and engine air pollutant emissions. If these views gain acceptance, supportfor existing measures promoting use and domestic production of corn-based ethanol could decline, leading to reduction or repealof these measures. These views could also negatively impact public perception of the ethanol industry and acceptance of ethanolas an alternative fuel. Federal support of cellulosic ethanolmay result in reduced incentives to corn-derived ethanol producers. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and EISAprovide funding opportunities in support of cellulosic ethanol obtained from biomass sources such as switchgrass and poplar trees.The amended RFS mandates an increasing level of production of non-corn-derived biofuels. These federal policies may suggest14a long-term political preference for cellulosicprocesses using alternative feedstocks such as switchgrass, silage or wood chips. Cellulosic ethanol has a smaller carbon footprintthan corn-derived ethanol, and is unlikely to divert foodstuff from the market. Several cellulosic ethanol plants are under developmentand there is a risk that cellulosic ethanol could displace corn ethanol. Our plants are designed as single-feedstock facilities,located in corn production areas with limited alternative feedstock nearby, and would require significant additional investmentto convert to the production of cellulosic ethanol. The adoption of cellulosic ethanol as the preferred form of ethanol could havea significant adverse effect on our ethanol business. Our ethanol business is affected by environmental and otherregulations which could impede or prohibit our ability to successfully operate our plants. Our ethanol production facilities are subjectto extensive air, water and other environmental regulations. We have had to obtain numerous permits to construct and operate ourplants. Regulatory agencies could impose conditions or other restrictions in the permits that are detrimental, or which increaseour costs. More stringent federal or state environmental regulations could be adopted which could significantly increase our operatingcosts or require us to expend considerable resources. Our ethanol plants emit various airbornepollutants as by-products of the ethanol production process, including carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas). In 2007, the U.S. SupremeCourt classified carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act in a case seeking to require the EPA to regulate carbondioxide in vehicle emissions. In February 2010, the EPA released its final regulations on the Renewable Fuel Standard program.We believe our plants are grandfathered up to certain operating capacity, but recent plant expansion requires us to meet a 20%threshold reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from a 2005 baseline measurement to produce ethanol eligible for the RFSII mandate. To further expand our plant capacity, we may be required to obtain additional permits, install advanced technologyequipment, or reduce drying of certain amounts of distillers grains. We may also be required to install carbon dioxide mitigationequipment or take other steps in order to comply with future laws or regulations. Compliance with future laws or regulations ofcarbon dioxide, or if we choose to expand capacity at certain of our plants, compliance with then-current regulations of carbondioxide, could be costly and may prevent us from operating our plants as profitably, which may have a negative impact on our financialperformance. We also face the risk of ethanol production above our grandfathered capacity not qualifying for RINS if the plantsdo not meet certain emission requirements. The California Air Resources Board (“CARB”)has adopted a Low Carbon Fuel Standard (“LCFS”) requiring a 10% reduction in GHG emissions from transportation fuelsby 2020. An Indirect Land Use Charge is included in this lifecycle GHG emission calculation. After a series of rulings that temporarilyprevented CARB from enforcing these regulations, the State of California Office of Administrative Law approved the LCFS on November26, 2012 and revised LCFS regulations took effect in January 2013. This standard could have an adverse impact on the market forcorn-based ethanol in California if corn-based ethanol fails to achieve lifecycle GHG emission reductions. This could have a negativeimpact on our financial performance. Our ethanol business may become subjectto various environmental and health and safety and property damage claims and liabilities. Operation of our ethanol business exposesthe business to the risk of environmental and health and safety claims and property damage claims, such as failure to comply withenvironmental regulations. These types of claims could also be made against our ethanol business based upon the acts or omissionsof other persons. Serious claims could have a material negative impact on our results of operations, financial position and futurecash flows.15Our business is not significantly diversified. Our financial results depend heavily onour ability to operate our ethanol plants profitably. Our lack of significant diversification could have a material negative impacton our results of operations, financial position and future cash flows should our ethanol plants operate unprofitably. We may have commitments to produce andsell ethanol. We may, at times, sell our products withforward contracts. If we are unable to produce the products due to economic conditions, business interruption, or other factors,we may incur additional costs or have to obtain commodities at unfavorable prices to meet our contractual commitments. This couldhave a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our revenue from the sale of distillersgrains depends upon its continued market acceptance as an animal feed. Distillers grains is a co-product fromthe fermentation of corn to produce ethanol. Antibiotics may be used during the fermentation process to control bacterial contamination;therefore antibiotics may be present in small quantities in distillers grains marketed as animal feed. The U. S. Food and DrugAdministration’s Center for Veterinary Medicine has expressed concern about potential animal and human health hazards fromthe use of distillers grains as an animal feed due to the possibility of antibiotic residues. If the public became concerned aboutthe impact of distillers grains in the food supply or as an acceptable animal feed, the market for distillers grains could be negativelyimpacted, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. We may not be able to obtain a suitable replacementfor antibiotics, should this be required, which would also negatively impact the market for distillers grains. An estimated 29% of distillers grains producedin the United States were exported in 2018. The price of distillers grains has benefitted from the exports of the product. In recentyears, certain countries have refused to import U.S. distillers grains for a variety of reasons. If export shipments are rejectedor delayed, the market price for distillers grains would be negatively impacted, which would have a negative impact on our ethanolresults of operations. At certain of our plants, we extract andsell non-food grade corn oil immediately prior to the production of distillers grains. Several studies are attempting to determinewhether non-food grade corn oil extraction may impact the nutritional value of the resulting distillers grains. If it is determinedthat non-food grade corn oil extraction adversely impacts the nutritional energy content of distillers grains, the value of thedistillers grains we sell may be negatively impacted, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. We face significantcompetition in the ethanol industry. We face significant competitionfor new ethanol investment opportunities. There are varied enterprises seeking to participate in the ethanol industry. Some enterprisesprovide financial and management support similar to our business model. Other enterprises seek to acquire or develop plants whichthey will directly own and operate. Many of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources and name recognitionthan we do. We must compete for investment opportunities based on our strategy of supporting and enhancing local development ofethanol plant opportunities. We may not be successful in competing for investment opportunities based on our strategy. The ethanol industryis primarily comprised of entities that engage exclusively in ethanol production and large integrated grain companies that produceethanol along with their base grain business. Several large oil companies have entered the ethanol production market. If thesecompanies increase their ethanol plant ownership or if other oil companies seek to engage in direct ethanol production, there wouldbe less of a need16to purchase ethanol fromindependent producers such as our ethanol plants. No assurance can be given that our ethanol plants will be able to compete successfullyor that competition from larger companies with greater financial resources will not have a materially adverse impact on the resultsof our ethanol operations. We may face competitionfrom foreign producers. There is a risk of foreigncompetition in the ethanol industry. Brazil is presently the second largest producer of ethanol in the world. Brazil’s ethanolproduction is sugarcane based, and, depending on feedstock prices, may be cheaper to produce than corn-derived ethanol. Under theRFS, certain parties were obligated to meet an advanced biofuel standard. In recent years, sugarcane based ethanol imported fromBrazil has been one of the most economical means for obligated parties to comply with this standard. If significant additionalforeign ethanol production capacity is created, such facilities could create excess supplies of ethanol, which may result in lowerprices of ethanol. In addition, foreign ethanol producers may be able to produce ethanol at costs lower than ours. These riskscould have significant adverse effects on our financial performance. We are exposed tocredit risk from our sales of ethanol and distillers grains to customers. The inability of a customerto make payments to us for our accounts receivable may cause us to experience losses and may adversely impact our liquidity andour ability to make our payments when due. We may not be ableto hire and retain qualified personnel to operate our ethanol plants. Our ability to attractand retain competent personnel has a significant impact on operating efficiencies and plant profitability. Competition for keyplant employees in the ethanol industry can be intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees. Failureto do so could have a negative impact on our financial results at individual plants. Our plants depend on an uninterrupted supply of energy andwater to operate. Unforeseen plant shutdowns could harm our business. Our plants require a significant and uninterruptedsupply of natural gas, electricity and water to operate. We generally rely on third parties to provide these resources. If thereis an interruption in the supply of energy or water for any reason, such as supply, delivery or mechanical problems and we areunable to secure an adequate alternative supply to sustain plant operations, we may be required to stop production. A productionhalt for an extended period of time could result in material losses. Potential business disruption from factorsoutside our control, including natural disasters, severe weather conditions, accidents, strikes, unexpected equipment failuresand unforeseen plant shutdowns, could adversely affect our cash flow and operating results. The debt agreements for certain of theethanol plants limit, or otherwise restrict the amount of dividends and other payments the ethanol subsidiaries can transfer totheir members. We are dependent on dividends from ourethanol subsidiaries to generate cash flow. Presently our unconsolidated ethanol subsidiary has debt agreements that limit paymentsto members. Therefore, this company cannot distribute all of the cash it generates to its members. Furthermore, we may not be ableto use the excess cash flow from one subsidiary to fund corporate needs or needs of another operating ethanol subsidiary.17We rely on information technology inour operations and financial reporting and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security breach of that technologycould harm our ability to efficiently operate our business and report our financial results accurately and timely. We rely heavily on information technologysystems across our operations, including for management of inventory, purchase orders, production, invoices, shipping, accountingand various other processes and transactions. Our ability to effectively manage our business, coordinate the production, distributionand sale of our products and ensure the timely and accurate recording and disclosure of financial information depends significantlyon the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioningto upgraded or replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems through a cyber-attack or otherwise could cause delaysin product sales, reduced efficiency of our operations and delays in reporting our financial results. Significant capital investmentscould be required to remediate any such problem. Security breaches of employee information or other confidential or proprietarydata could also adversely impact our reputation, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. We are exposed to potential businessdisruption from factors outside our control, including natural disasters, severe weather conditions, accidents, and unforeseenoperational failures any of which could negatively affect our transportation operations and could adversely affect our cash flowsand operating results. Potential business disruption in availabletransportation due to natural disasters, severe weather conditions, significant track damage resulting from a train derailment,strikes or other interruptions by our transportation providers could result in delays in procuring and supplying raw materialsto our ethanol facilities, or transporting ethanol and distillers grains to our customers. Such business disruptions may resultin our inability to meet customer demand or contract delivery requirements, as well as the potential loss of customers. Rail cars used to transport ethanolmay need to be modified or replaced to meet proposed rail safety regulations. The leased rail cars we use to transportethanol to market will need to be retrofitted or replaced as the Enhanced Tank Car Standards and Operation Controls for High-HazardFlammable Trains adopted by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) imposes an enhanced tank car standard knownas the DOT specification 117 and establishes a schedule to retrofit or replace older tank cars that carry crude oil and ethanol.The rule also establishes braking standards intended to reduce the severity of accidents and new operational protocols. This couldlead to increased rail car lease costs and delays in transportation of ethanol if rail cars are out of service for extended periodsof time. We operate in a capital intensive industry.Limitations on external financing could adversely affect our financial performance. We may need to incur additional financingto fund growth of our business or in times of increasing liquidity requirements (such as increases in raw material costs). Bankruptcyfilings by several ethanol companies in past years and capital market volatility has reduced available capital for the ethanolindustry. Any delays in obtaining additional financing, or our inability to do so, could have a material adverse impact on ourfinancial results.18Risks Related to our Refined Coal Operations Our refined coal investment is subject to various risks anduncertainties. We purchased a company that produces refinedcoal that we believe qualifies to earn tax credits under IRC Section 45 through November 2021. Our ability to generate returnsand avoid write-offs in connection with this investment is subject to various risks and uncertainties. These include, but are notlimited to, the risks and uncertainties as set forth below. Availability of the tax credits under IRC Section 45. Our ability to claim tax credits underIRC Section 45 depends upon the operation which we have purchased satisfying certain ongoing conditions set forth in IRC Section45. Furthermore, the tax credits under IRC Section 45 could be reduced or completely eliminated as a result of changes in incometax laws and/or regulations. The IRS could ultimately determine thatthe refined coal facility we purchased and/or its operations have not satisfied, or have not continued to satisfy, the conditionsset forth in IRC Section 45. As our refined coal operation is expected to generate pre-tax losses, the unavailability of the taxcredits for any reason could have a material impact on our results of operations. IRC Section 45 phase out provisions. IRC Section 45 contains phase out provisionsbased upon the market price of coal such that, if the price of coal rises to specified levels, we could lose some or all of thetax credits we expect to receive from this operation.The refined coal operation depends on one customer. The refined coal operation receives taxcredits by selling its refined coal to an unrelated party. The unrelated party is not obligated to continue purchasing refinedcoal from us. Our user of refined coal could convert its fuel source to natural gas, oil or some other source instead of coal dependingon the price of natural gas, oil or other sources relative to that of coal. If the unrelated party ceases to purchase refined coalfrom us, we would attempt to move our refined coal plant to a different location, which could require us to invest additional capital,or to find a different user to purchase our refined coal. In addition, we may not be able to find a suitable location to move ourrefined coal plant to or find a different user to purchase our refined coal in a timely manner. Market demand for coal may alsodecline as a result of an economic slowdown. Sustained low natural gas prices may also cause users of coal to phase out or closeexisting coal using operations. If users of coal burn less coal or eliminate the use of coal there would be less need for our product.A reduction or cessation of refined coal sales could have a material impact on our results of operations. Environmental concerns regarding coalcould lead to reduced or suspended refined coal operations. Environmental concerns about greenhousegases, toxic wastewater discharges and the potential hazardous nature of coal combustion waste could lead to regulations that discouragethe burning of coal. Such regulations could mandate that electric power generating companies purchase a minimum amount of powerfrom renewable energy sources such as wind, hydroelectric, solar and geothermal. This could result in utilities burning less coal,which could have a material impact on our results of operations. The refined coal operation in which we have invested andthe by-products from such operations may result in environmental and product liability claims and environmental compliance costs. The construction and operation of refinedcoal operations are subject to Federal, state and local laws, regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating tothe protection or preservation of the19environment, natural resources and humanhealth and safety. Such laws and regulations generally require the operations and/or the utilities at which the operations arelocated to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations, licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Suchlaws and regulations also impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of a party’s conduct, on certain entitiesthat are considered to have contributed to, or are otherwise involved in, the release or threatened release of hazardous substancesinto the environment. Such hazardous substances could be released as a result of burning refined coal in a number of ways, includingair emissions, waste water, and by-products such as fly ash. One party may, under certain circumstances, be required to bear morethan its share or the entire share of investigation and cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtainedfrom other responsible parties. We may be exposed to the risk of becoming liable for environmental damage we may have had little,if any, involvement in creating. Such risk remains even after production ceases at an operation to the extent the environmentaldamage can be traced to the types of chemicals or compounds used or operations conducted in connection with the use of refinedcoal. No assurances can be given that contractualarrangements and precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators will result in that facilityowner or operator accepting full responsibility for any environmental damage. It is also not uncommon for private claims by thirdparties alleging contamination to also include claims for personal injury, property damage, diminution of property or similar claims.Furthermore, many environmental, health and safety laws authorize citizen suits, permitting third parties to make claims for violationsof laws or permits and force compliance. Our insurance may not cover all environmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficientcoverage in the event of an environmental claim. If significant uninsured losses arise from environmental damage or product liabilityclaims, or if the costs of environmental compliance increase for any reason, our results of operations and financial conditioncould be adversely affected. We rely on a third party to operate the refined coal facility. We rely on an unrelated third party tooperate the refined coal plant. Should the third party fail to perform or underperform in the operation, management or regulatorycompliance of the facility, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected as we are not experiencedin operating a refined coal facility. We will have to generate taxable incometo utilize the Section 45 federal production tax credits. If we do not generate sufficient taxableincome to utilize the tax credits earned by our refined coal operation, we could incur write-offs of the related tax attributeswhich could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, this could adversely reduce our liquidityreserves as we expect to incur operating losses sustained by the refined coal operation.20Risks Related to our eSteam investment eSteam may not be a commercially viabletechnology. During fiscal year 2013, we invested ineSteam, a new technology utilizing steam to extract deep heavy oil. Cumulatively, we have spent approximately $2.0 million on thispatented but unproven technology. To date, we have not tested or proven the viability of the technology. In addition, low energyand crude oil prices may make eSteam technology less attractive to potential users. If we cannot demonstrate that the technologyis commercially feasible, we may incur additional losses. eSteam testing methods and results arenot known. We do not have specific testing methodologiesor specifications developed for testing the viability of the eSteam technology. The actual eSteam testing process could resultin injury to others, and property and other damages that could expose us to claims for damages from unrelated parties. Our eSteam technology may be subjectto patent challenges. If our patents of the eSteam technologyare challenged, we could be required to spend considerable time and resources defending our patents. Operations utilizing our eSteam technologymay be subject to stringent environmental regulations. Use of the eSteam technology will requiresignificant amounts of water and energy. If we or third parties are unable to obtain the proper permits and sources of water andenergy, then we may not be able to commercialize the new technology, and thus, generate any revenue from our investment. Operations utilizing our eSteam technologymay cause environmental damage. When testing and operating the eSteam technology,we may cause environmental damage, as we would be injecting water and other fluids into the ground to generate underground steamin order to extract oil. We could be subject to significant penalties and fines if we were to cause environmental damage. Risks Related to REX and non-industryspecific matters. We have concentrations of cash depositsat financial institutions that exceed federal insurance limits. We generally have cash deposits that exceedfederal insurance limits. Should the financial institutions we deposit our cash in experience insolvency or other financial difficulty,our access to cash deposits could be limited. In extreme cases, we could lose our cash deposits entirely. This would negativelyimpact our liquidity and results of operations. We may fail to realize the anticipatedbenefits of mergers, acquisitions, or other investments. We intend to continue seeking growth opportunities.Acquisitions and similar transactions involve many risks that could harm our business, which include: ·The anticipated benefits of these transactions may not be fully realized, or take longer to realizethan expected,·Future acquisitions could result in operating losses or loss of investment, and·Future acquisitions may involve incurring debt to complete these transactions, which could havea material adverse effect on our financial condition.21"
11,REX,REX AMERICAN RESOURCES CORP,2018-03-29,"Risk Factors
 We encourage you to carefully considerthe risks described below and other information contained in this report when considering an investment decision in REX commonstock. Any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If one or more of these events do occur, our results ofoperations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In this instance, the trading price of REXstock could decline, and investors might lose all or part of their investment. Risks Related to our Ethanol andby-Products Business The ethanol industry is changing rapidlywhich could result in unexpected developments that could negatively impact our operations. According to the RFA, the ethanol industryhas grown from approximately 1.5 billion gallons of domestic annual ethanol production in 1999 to approximately 15.8 billion gallonsin 2017. Thus, there have been significant changes in the supply and demand of ethanol over a relatively short period of timewhich could lead to difficulty in maintaining profitable operations at our ethanol plants. The financial returns on our ethanolinvestments are highly dependent on commodity prices, which are subject to significant volatility, uncertainty and regional supplyshortages, so our results could fluctuate substantially. The financial returnson our ethanol investments are highly dependent on commodity prices, especially prices for corn, natural gas, ethanol, dried distillersgrains, non-food grade corn oil and unleaded gasoline. As a result of the volatility of the prices for these items, our returnsmay fluctuate substantially and our investments could experience periods of declining prices for their products and increasingcosts for their raw materials, which could result in operating losses at our ethanol plants. Our returns onethanol investments are highly sensitive to grain prices.  Corn is the principal raw material our ethanol plants use toproduce ethanol and co-products. As a result, changes in the price of corn can significantly affect our businesses. Rising cornprices result in higher production costs of ethanol and co-products. Because ethanol competes with non-corn-based fuels, our ethanolplants may not be able to pass along increased grain costs to our customers. At certain levels, grain prices may make ethanoluneconomical to produce. The price of corn isinfluenced by weather conditions and other factors affecting crop yields, transportation costs, farmer planting decisions, exports,the value of the U.S. dollar and general economic, market and regulatory factors. These factors include government policies andsubsidies with respect to agriculture and international trade and global and local demand and supply. The significance and relativeeffect of these factors on the price of corn is difficult to predict. Any event that tends to negatively affect the supply ofcorn, such as adverse weather or crop disease, could increase corn prices and potentially harm the business of our ethanol plants.Increasing domestic ethanol capacity could boost the demand for corn and result in increased corn prices. Much of the MidwesternUnited States experienced drought conditions during 2012 which led to a smaller harvest of corn and increased corn prices. Ourethanol plants may also have difficulty, from time to time, in physically sourcing corn on economic terms due to regional supplyshortages or unfavorable local pricing. Such a shortage or price impact could require our ethanol plants to suspend operations which would havea material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.8The spread betweenethanol and corn prices can vary significantly. The gross margin at our ethanol plants depends principally on the spreadbetween ethanol and corn prices. Fluctuations in the spread are likely to continue to occur. A sustained narrow or negative spread,whether as a result of sustained high or increased corn prices or sustained low or decreased ethanol prices, would adversely affectthe results of operations at our ethanol plants. Our risk managementstrategies may be ineffective and may expose us to decreased profitability and liquidity. In an attempt to partially offsetthe impact of volatility of commodity prices, we enter into forward contracts to sell a portion of our ethanol and distillersgrains production and to purchase a portion of our corn and natural gas requirements. The financial impact of these risk managementactivities is dependent upon, among other items, the prices involved and our ability to receive or deliver the commodities involved.Risk management activities can result in financial loss when positions are purchased in a declining market or when positions aresold in an increasing market. In addition, we may not be able to match the appropriate quantity of corn contracts with quantitiesof ethanol, distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil contracts. We vary the amount of risk management techniques we utilize,and we may choose not to engage in any risk management activities. Should we fail to properly manage the inherent volatility ofcommodities prices, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. The market fornatural gas is subject to market conditions that create uncertainty in the price and availability of the natural gas that ourethanol plants use in their manufacturing process. Our ethanol plants rely upon third parties for their supply of naturalgas, which is consumed as fuel in the production process. The prices for and availability of natural gas are subject to volatilemarket conditions. These market conditions often are affected by factors beyond the ethanol plants’ control, such as weatherconditions, overall economic conditions and foreign and domestic governmental regulation and relations. Significant disruptionsin the supply of natural gas could impair or completely prevent the ethanol plants’ ability to economically manufactureethanol for their customers. Furthermore, increases in natural gas prices or changes in our natural gas costs relative to naturalgas costs paid by competitors may adversely affect results of operations and financial position at our ethanol plants. Fluctuations in the selling priceof commodities may reduce profit margins at our ethanol plants. Ethanol is marketed as a fuel additive to reduce vehicleemissions from gasoline, as an octane enhancer to improve the octane rating of gasoline with which it is blended and, to a lesserextent, as a gasoline substitute. As a result, ethanol prices are influenced by the supply and demand for gasoline and our ethanolplants’ results of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected if gasoline demand or prices decrease. Distillers grains compete with other proteinbased animal feed products. The price of distillers grains may decrease when the prices of competing feed products decrease. Theprices of competing animal feed products are based in part on the prices of the commodities from which their products are made.Historically, sales prices for distillers grains have tracked along with the price of corn. However, there have been instanceswhen the price increase for distillers grains has lagged price increases in corn prices. The production of distillers grains hasincreased as a result of increases in dry mill ethanol production in the United States. This could lead to price declines in whatwe can sell our distillers grains for in the future. Such declines could have an adverse material effect on our results of operations. Increased ethanolproduction or decreases in demand for ethanol may result in excess production capacity in the ethanol industry, which may causethe price of ethanol, distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil to decrease. 9According to the RFA,domestic ethanol production capacity is approximately 16.2 billion gallons per year as of January 2018. The RFA estimates that,as of January 2018, approximately 465 million gallons per year of additional production capacity is under construction or expansion.In addition, certain operating plants have qualified as efficient ethanol producers through the EPA pathway assessment, and areexpanding, or planning to expand their capacity. The EPA set the RFS requirement to be satisfied by corn-derived ethanol at 15.0billion gallons for 2017 and 2018. Excess capacity in the ethanol industry could have an adverse effect on the results of ouroperations. In a manufacturing industry with excess capacity, producers have an incentive to manufacture additional products forso long as the price exceeds the marginal cost of production (i.e., the cost of producing only the next unit, without regard forinterest, overhead or fixed costs). This incentive could result in the reduction of the market price of ethanol to a level thatis inadequate to generate sufficient cash flow to cover costs. Excess capacity mayalso result from decreases in the demand for ethanol, which could result from a number of factors, including, but not limitedto, regulatory developments and reduced U.S. gasoline consumption. Reduced gasoline consumption could occur as a result of increasedprices for gasoline or crude oil, which could cause businesses and consumers to reduce driving or acquire vehicles with more favorablegasoline mileage or acquire non-gasoline powered vehicles. In addition, becauseethanol production produces distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil as co-products, increased ethanol production will alsolead to increased supplies of distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil. An increase in the supply of distillers grains andnon-food grade corn oil, without corresponding increases in demand, could lead to lower prices or an inability to sell our ethanolplants’ distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil production. A decline in the price of distillers grains or non-foodgrade corn oil could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations. The price of ethanol and distillersgrains may decline as a result of trade restrictions or duties on ethanol and distillers grains exports from the United Statesor from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.  The United States exportedapproximately 1.3 billion gallons of ethanol in 2017. If producers and exporters of ethanol are subject to traderestrictions, or additional duties are imposed on exports, it may make it uneconomical to export ethanol. China raised its 5%tariff on U.S. fuel ethanol to 30%, effective January 1, 2017 and has threatened additional tariff increases in response torecently announced U.S. tariffs. Furthermore, unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates could reduce the demand forUnited States ethanol exports. This could result in an oversupply of ethanol in the United States which could have a materialadverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations. Exports of distillers grains producedin the United States have been increasing in recent years. However, the export market may be jeopardized if foreign governmentsimpose trade barriers or other measures to protect the foreign local markets. In January 2016, the China Ministry of Commerceannounced it had initiated anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations of U.S. dried distillers grains exports to China.China also announced it had established anti-dumping duties on imports of U.S. dried distillers grains that range from 42.2% to53.7% and also had established countervailing duties that range from 11.2% to 12%. If producers and exporters of distillers grainsare subjected to trade barriers when selling distillers grains to foreign customers, there may be a reduction in the price ofdistillers grains in the United States. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could reduce the demand for UnitedStates exports of distillers grains. Declines in the price we receive for our distillers grains could lead to decreased revenuesand may result in our inability to operate our ethanol plants profitably. Future demand for ethanol is uncertainand changes in overall consumer demand for transportation fuel could affect demand.10There are limited markets for ethanolother that what is federally mandated. Increased consumer acceptance of E15 and E85 fuel is likely necessary in order for ethanolto achieve significant market share growth beyond federal mandate levels. We depend on our partners to operatecertain of our ethanol investments. Our investments currently represent bothmajority and minority equity positions. Day-to-day operating control of minority owned plants generally remains with the localinvestor group. We do not have the ability to directly modify the operations of these plants in response to changes in the businessenvironment or in response to any deficiencies in local operations of the plants. In addition, local plant operators, who alsorepresent the primary suppliers of corn and other crops to the plants, may have interests, such as the price and sourcing of cornand other crops, that may differ from our interest, which is based solely on the operating profit of the plant. The limitationson our ability to control day-to-day plant operations could adversely affect plant results of operations. We may not successfully acquire ordevelop additional ethanol investments. The growth of our ethanolbusiness depends on our ability to identify and develop new ethanol investments. Our ethanol development strategy depends on referrals,and introductions, to new investment opportunities from industry participants, such as ethanol plant builders, financial institutions,marketing agents and others. We must continue to maintain favorable relationships with these industry participants, and a materialdisruption in these sources of referrals would adversely affect our ability to expand our ethanol investments. Any expansion strategywill depend on prevailing market conditions for the price of ethanol and the cost of corn and natural gas and the expectationsof future market conditions. There is increasing competition for suitable sites for ethanol plants. Even if suitable sites oropportunities are identified, we may not be able to secure the services and products from contractors, engineering firms, constructionfirms and equipment suppliers necessary to build or expand ethanol plants on a timely basis or on acceptable economic terms. Constructioncosts may increase to levels that would make a new plant too expensive to complete or unprofitable to operate. Additional financingmay also be necessary to implement any expansion strategy, which may not be accessible or available on acceptable terms. New andmore stringent environmental regulations could increase the operating costs and risks of new plants, which, in turn could discourageus from further expansion. In addition, failure to adequately manage the risks associated with additional ethanol investmentscould have a material adverse effect on our business. Our ethanol plants may be adverselyaffected by technological advances and efforts to anticipate and employ such technological advances may prove unsuccessful.  The development and implementation ofnew technologies may result in a significant reduction in the costs of ethanol production. For instance, any technological advancesin the efficiency or cost to produce ethanol from inexpensive cellulosic sources such as corn stalk, wheat, oat or barley strawcould have an adverse effect on our ethanol plants, because our plants are designed to produce ethanol from corn, which is, bycomparison, a raw material with other high value uses. We cannot predict when new technologies may become available, the rateof acceptance of new technologies by competitors or the costs associated with new technologies. In addition, advances in the developmentof alternatives to ethanol could significantly reduce demand for or eliminate the need for ethanol. Any advances in technology which requiresignificant unanticipated capital expenditures to remain competitive or which reduce demand or prices for ethanol would have amaterial adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations.11In addition, alternative fuels, additivesand oxygenates are continually under development. Alternative fuel additives that can replace ethanol may be developed, whichmay decrease the demand for ethanol. It is also possible that technological advances in engine and exhaust system design and performancecould reduce the use of oxygenates, which would lower the demand for ethanol, and the results of our ethanol operations may bematerially adversely affected. The U.S. ethanol industry is highlydependent upon a myriad of federal and state legislation and regulation and any changes in legislation or regulation could materiallyand adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. The Energy Independence and Security Actof 2007 (EISA) established RFS II, which modified the renewable fuel standard from prior legislation. EISA increased the amountof renewable fuel required to be blended into gasoline and required a minimum usage of corn-derived renewable fuels of 12.0 billiongallons in 2010, increasing annually by 600 million gallons to 15.0 billion gallons in 2015 through 2022, with no specified volumesubsequent to 2022. The EPA has the authority to assign the mandated amounts of renewable fuels to be blended into transportationfuel to individual fuel blenders. RFS II has been a primary factor in the growth of ethanol usage. Over the past several yearsvarious pieces of legislation have been introduced to the U.S. Congress that were intended to reduce or eliminate ethanol blendingrequirements. To date, none of the bills have been successful but they are an indication of the continued effort to underminethe EISA. For example, on January 3, 2017, the Leave Ethanol Volumes at Existing Levels (“LEVEL”) Act (H.R. 119) wasintroduced in the U.S. House of Representatives. The bill would freeze renewable fuel blending requirements under the RFS at 7.5billion gallons per year, prohibit the sale of gasoline containing more than 10% ethanol, and revoke the EPA’s approvalof E15 blends. In addition, on January 31, 2017, a bill (H.R. 777) was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives that wouldrequire the EPA and National Academies of Sciences to conduct a study on the implication of the use of mid-level ethanol blends.A mid-level ethanol blend is an ethanol gasoline blend containing 10-20% ethanol by volume, including E15 and E20, that is intendedto be used in any conventional gasoline powered motor vehicle or non-road vehicle or engine. On March 2, 2017, a bill (H.R. 1315)was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives that would limit the volume of ethanol in gasoline to 10%. On the same day,the RFS Elimination Act (H.R. 1314) was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives. The bill would fully repeal the RFS. Under EISA, the EPA has the authorityto waive or modify the mandated RFS II requirements in whole or in part. In order to grant a waiver, the EPA administrator mustdetermine in consultation with the Secretaries of Agriculture and Energy, that one of the following two conditions has been met:i) there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply or ii) implementation of the requirement would severely harm the economyor environment of a state, region or the country. In certain past years the EPA has taken action to reduce the mandated gallonscalled for under EISA for both conventional and advanced renewable fuels. Pursuant to RFS II, if mandatory renewablefuel volumes are reduced by at least 20% for two consecutive years, the EPA is required to modify, or reset, statutory volumesthrough 2022. While conventional ethanol maintained 15 billion gallons, 2018 is the first year the total proposed renewable volumeobligations (“RVOs”) RVOs are more than 20% below statutory volumes levels. Thus, the EPA Administrator directed hisstaff to initiate the required technical analysis to perform any future reset consistent with the reset rules. The reset willbe triggered if the 2019 RVOs continue to be more than 20% below the statutory levels, and the EPA will be required to modifystatutory volumes through 2022 within one year of the trigger event, based on the same factors used to set the RVOs post-2022.The EPA has maintained the statutory 15.0 billion gallons requirement for conventional renewable fuels but reduced the statutoryrequirement for advanced biofuels based upon supply limitations for 2017 and 2018.12Obligated parties use renewable identificationnumbers (“RINs”) to show compliance with RFS-mandated volumes. RINs are attached to renewable fuels by producers anddetached when the renewable fuel is blended with transportation fuel or traded in the open market. The market price of detachedRINs affects the price of ethanol in certain markets and influences the purchasing decisions by obligated parties. As a resultof fluctuations in RINs pricing, certain obligated parties have petitioned the EPA and filed court actions to change the pointof obligation or to seek relief from their obligation. If this action leads to reduced values for RINs, it could negatively impactthe price we receive for ethanol sales. If the United States were to withdrawfrom or materially modify the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) or certain other international trade agreements,our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Ethanol and other productsthat we produce are sold into Canada, Mexico and other countries with trade agreements with the United States. If tariffs wereraised on the foreign-sourced goods that lead to retaliatory actions, it could have material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition and results of operations. The inability to generate or obtainRINs could adversely affect our operating results. Virtually all of our ethanol is sold with RINs that are used by customersto comply with RFS II. If our production does not meet EPA requirements for RIN generation in the future, we would have to purchaseRINs in the open market or sell our ethanol at substantially lower prices to adjust for the absence of RINs. The price of RINsvaries based on many factors and cannot be predicted. Failure to obtain sufficient RINS or reliance on invalid RINs could subjectus to fines and penalties imposed by the EPA. Changes in corporate average fueleconomy standards could adversely impact ethanol prices. Flexible fuel vehicles receive preferential treatment in meetingfederally mandated corporate average fuel economy (“CAFE”) standards for automobiles manufactured by car makers. Highblend ethanol fuels such as E-85 result in lower fuel efficiencies. Absent the CAFE preferences, car makers would not likely buildflexible-fuel vehicles. Any change in CAFE preferences could reduce the growth of E-85 markets and result in lower ethanol prices. Various studies have criticized theefficiency of ethanol, in general, and corn-based ethanol in particular, which could lead to the reduction or repeal of incentivesand tariffs that promote the use and domestic production of ethanol or otherwise negatively impact public perception and acceptanceof ethanol as an alternative fuel.  Although many trade groups, academicsand governmental agencies have supported ethanol as a fuel additive that promotes a cleaner environment, others have criticizedethanol production as consuming considerably more energy and emitting more greenhouse gases than other biofuels and as potentiallydepleting water resources. Other studies have suggested that corn-based ethanol is less efficient than ethanol produced from switchgrassor wheat grain and that it negatively impacts consumers by causing prices for dairy, meat and other foodstuffs from livestockthat consume corn to increase. If these views gain acceptance, support for existing measures promoting use and domestic productionof corn-based ethanol could decline, leading to reduction or repeal of these measures. These views could also negatively impactpublic perception of the ethanol industry and acceptance of ethanol as an alternative fuel. Federal support of cellulosic ethanolmay result in reduced incentives to corn-derived ethanol producers.  The American Recovery and ReinvestmentAct of 2009 and EISA provide funding opportunities in support of cellulosic ethanol obtained from biomass sources such as switchgrassand poplar trees. The amended RFS mandates an increasing level of production of non-corn-derived biofuels. These federal policiesmay suggest13a long-term politicalpreference for cellulosic processes using alternative feedstocks such as switchgrass, silage or wood chips. Cellulosic ethanolhas a smaller carbon footprint than corn-derived ethanol, and is unlikely to divert foodstuff from the market. Several cellulosicethanol plants are under development and there is a risk that cellulosic ethanol could displace corn ethanol. Our plants are designedas single-feedstock facilities, located in corn production areas with limited alternative feedstock nearby, and would requiresignificant additional investment to convert to the production of cellulosic ethanol. The adoption of cellulosic ethanol as thepreferred form of ethanol could have a significant adverse effect on our ethanol business. Our ethanol business is affected by environmental and otherregulations which could impede or prohibit our ability to successfully operate our plants. Our ethanol production facilities aresubject to extensive air, water and other environmental regulations. We have had to obtain numerous permits to construct and operateour plants. Regulatory agencies could impose conditions or other restrictions in the permits that are detrimental or which increaseour costs. More stringent federal or state environmental regulations could be adopted which could significantly increase our operatingcosts or require us to expend considerable resources. Our ethanol plants emit various airbornepollutants as by-products of the ethanol production process, including carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas). In 2007, the U.S. SupremeCourt classified carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act in a case seeking to require the EPA to regulate carbondioxide in vehicle emissions. In February 2010, the EPA released its final regulations on the Renewable Fuel Standard program.We believe our plants are grandfathered up to certain operating capacity, but recent plant expansion requires us to meet a 20%threshold reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from a 2005 baseline measurement to produce ethanol eligible for the RFSII mandate. To further expand our plant capacity, we may be required to obtain additional permits, install advanced technologyequipment, or reduce drying of certain amounts of distillers grains. We may also be required to install carbon dioxide mitigationequipment or take other steps in order to comply with future laws or regulations. Compliance with future laws or regulations ofcarbon dioxide, or if we choose to expand capacity at certain of our plants, compliance with then-current regulations of carbondioxide, could be costly and may prevent us from operating our plants as profitably, which may have a negative impact on our financialperformance. We also face the risk of ethanol production above our grandfathered capacity not qualifying for RINS if the plantsdo not meet certain emission requirements. The California Air Resources Board (“CARB”)has adopted a Low Carbon Fuel Standard (“LCFS”) requiring a 10% reduction in GHG emissions from transportation fuelsby 2020. An Indirect Land Use Charge is included in this lifecycle GHG emission calculation. After a series of rulings that temporarilyprevented CARB from enforcing these regulations, the State of California Office of Administrative Law approved the LCFS on November26, 2012 and revised LCFS regulations took effect in January 2013. This standard could have an adverse impact on the market forcorn-based ethanol in California if corn-based ethanol fails to achieve lifecycle GHG emission reductions. This could have a negativeimpact on our financial performance. Our ethanol business may become subjectto various environmental and health and safety and property damage claims and liabilities.  Operation of our ethanol business exposesthe business to the risk of environmental and health and safety claims and property damage claims, such as failure to comply withenvironmental regulations. These types of claims could also be made against our ethanol business based upon the acts or omissionsof other persons.14Serious claims couldhave a material negative impact on our results of operations, financial position and future cash flows. Our business is not significantly diversified. Our financial results depend heavily onour ability to operate our ethanol plants profitably. Our lack of significant diversification could have a material negative impacton our results of operations, financial position and future cash flows should our ethanol plants operate unprofitably. We may have commitments to produceand sell ethanol. We may, at times, sell our products withforward contracts. If we are unable to produce the products due to economic conditions, business interruption, or other factors,we may incur additional costs or have to obtain commodities at unfavorable prices to meet our contractual commitments. This couldhave a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our revenue from the sale of distillersgrains depends upon its continued market acceptance as an animal feed. Distillers grains is a co-product fromthe fermentation of corn to produce ethanol. Antibiotics may be used during the fermentation process to control bacterial contamination;therefore antibiotics may be present in small quantities in distillers grains marketed as animal feed. The U. S. Food and DrugAdministration’s Center for Veterinary Medicine has expressed concern about potential animal and human health hazards from theuse of distillers grains as an animal feed due to the possibility of antibiotic residues. If the public became concerned aboutthe impact of distillers grains in the food supply or as an acceptable animal feed, the market for distillers grains could benegatively impacted, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. We may not be able to obtain a suitablereplacement for antibiotics, should this be required, which would also negatively impact the market for distillers grains. An estimated 29% of distillers grainsproduced in the United States were exported in 2017. The price of distillers grains has benefitted from the exports of the product.In recent years, certain countries have refused to import U.S. distillers grains for a variety of reasons. If export shipmentsare rejected or delayed, the market price for distillers grains would be negatively impacted, which would have a negative impacton our ethanol results of operations. At certain of our plants, we extract andsell non-food grade corn oil immediately prior to the production of distillers grains. Several studies are attempting to determinewhether non-food grade corn oil extraction may impact the nutritional value of the resulting distillers grains. If it is determinedthat non-food grade corn oil extraction adversely impacts the nutritional energy content of distillers grains, the value of thedistillers grains we sell may be negatively impacted, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. We face significantcompetition in the ethanol industry. We face significantcompetition for new ethanol investment opportunities. There are varied enterprises seeking to participate in the ethanol industry.Some enterprises provide financial and management support similar to our business model. Other enterprises seek to acquire ordevelop plants which they will directly own and operate. Many of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resourcesand name recognition than we do. We must compete for investment opportunities based on our strategy of supporting and enhancinglocal development of ethanol plant opportunities. We may not be successful in competing for investment opportunities based onour strategy.15The ethanol industryis primarily comprised of entities that engage exclusively in ethanol production and large integrated grain companies that produceethanol along with their base grain business. Several large oil companies have entered the ethanol production market. If thesecompanies increase their ethanol plant ownership or if other oil companies seek to engage in direct ethanol production, therewould be less of a need to purchase ethanol from independent producers such as our ethanol plants. No assurance can be given thatour ethanol plants will be able to compete successfully or that competition from larger companies with greater financial resourceswill not have a materially adverse impact on the results of our ethanol operations. We may face competitionfrom foreign producers. There is a risk of foreigncompetition in the ethanol industry. Brazil is presently the second largest producer of ethanol in the world. Brazil’s ethanolproduction is sugarcane based, and, depending on feedstock prices, may be cheaper to produce than corn-derived ethanol. Underthe RFS, certain parties were obligated to meet an advanced biofuel standard. In recent years, sugarcane based ethanol importedfrom Brazil has been one of the most economical means for obligated parties to comply with this standard. If significant additionalforeign ethanol production capacity is created, such facilities could create excess supplies of ethanol, which may result in lowerprices of ethanol. In addition, foreign ethanol producers may be able to produce ethanol at costs lower than ours. These riskscould have significant adverse effects on our financial performance. We are exposed tocredit risk from our sales of ethanol and distillers grains to customers. The inability of a customerto make payments to us for our accounts receivable may cause us to experience losses and may adversely impact our liquidity andour ability to make our payments when due. We may not be ableto hire and retain qualified personnel to operate our ethanol plants. Our ability to attractand retain competent personnel has a significant impact on operating efficiencies and plant profitability. Competition for keyplant employees in the ethanol industry can be intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees. Failureto do so could have a negative impact on our financial results at individual plants. Our plants depend on an uninterrupted supply of energy andwater to operate. Unforeseen plant shutdowns could harm our business. Our plants require a significant and uninterruptedsupply of natural gas, electricity and water to operate. We generally rely on third parties to provide these resources. If thereis an interruption in the supply of energy or water for any reason, such as supply, delivery or mechanical problems and we areunable to secure an adequate alternative supply to sustain plant operations, we may be required to stop production. A productionhalt for an extended period of time could result in material losses. Potential business disruption from factorsoutside our control, including natural disasters, severe weather conditions, accidents, strikes, unexpected equipment failuresand unforeseen plant shutdowns, could adversely affect our cash flow and operating results. The debt agreements for certain ofthe ethanol plants limit, or otherwise restrict the amount of dividends and other payments the ethanol subsidiaries can transferto their members. 16We are dependent on dividends from ourethanol subsidiaries to generate cash flow. Presently our unconsolidated ethanol subsidiary has debt agreements that limit paymentsto members. Therefore, this company cannot distribute all of the cash it generates to its members. Furthermore, we may not beable to use the excess cash flow from one subsidiary to fund corporate needs or needs of another operating ethanol subsidiary. We rely on information technology inour operations and financial reporting and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security breach of that technologycould harm our ability to efficiently operate our business and report our financial results accurately and timely. We rely heavily on information technologysystems across our operations, including for management of inventory, purchase orders, production, invoices, shipping, accountingand various other processes and transactions. Our ability to effectively manage our business, coordinate the production, distributionand sale of our products and ensure the timely and accurate recording and disclosure of financial information depends significantlyon the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioningto upgraded or replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems through a cyber-attack or otherwise could cause delaysin product sales, reduced efficiency of our operations and delays in reporting our financial results. Significant capital investmentscould be required to remediate any such problem. Security breaches of employee information or other confidential or proprietarydata could also adversely impact our reputation, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. We are exposed to potential businessdisruption from factors outside our control, including natural disasters, severe weather conditions, accidents, and unforeseenoperational failures any of which could negatively affect our transportation operations and could adversely affect our cash flowsand operating results. Potential businessdisruption in available transportation due to natural disasters, severe weather conditions, significant track damage resultingfrom a train derailment, strikes or other interruptions by our transportation providers could result in delays in procuring andsupplying raw materials to our ethanol facilities, or transporting ethanol and distillers grains to our customers. Such businessdisruptions may result in our inability to meet customer demand or contract delivery requirements, as well as the potential lossof customers. Rail cars used to transport ethanolmay need to be modified or replaced to meet proposed rail safety regulations. The leased rail cars we use to transportethanol to market will need to be retrofitted or replaced as the Enhanced Tank Car Standards and Operation Controls for High-HazardFlammable Trains adopted by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) imposes an enhanced tank car standard knownas the DOT specification 117 and establishes a schedule to retrofit or replace older tank cars that carry crude oil and ethanol.The rule also establishes braking standards intended to reduce the severity of accidents and new operational protocols. This couldlead to increased rail car lease costs and delays in transportation of ethanol if rail cars are out of service for extended periodsof time. We operate in a capital intensive industry.Limitations on external financing could adversely affect our financial performance. We may need to incur additional financingto fund growth of our business or in times of increasing liquidity requirements (such as increases in raw material costs). Bankruptcyfilings by several ethanol companies in17past years and capitalmarket volatility has reduced available capital for the ethanol industry. Any delays in obtaining additional financing, or ourinability to do so, could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. Risks Related to our Refined Coal Operations Our refined coal investment is subject to various risksand uncertainties. We purchased a company that produces refined coal that we believe qualifies to earn tax credits under IRC Section 45 through November2021. Our ability to generate returns and avoid write-offs in connection with this investment is subject to various risks anduncertainties. These include, but are not limited to, the risks and uncertainties as set forth below. Availability of the tax credits under IRC Section 45. Our ability to claim tax credits underIRC Section 45 depends upon the operation which we have purchased satisfying certain ongoing conditions set forth in IRC Section45. Furthermore, the tax credits under IRC Section 45 could be reduced or completely eliminated as a result of changes in incometax laws and/or regulations. The IRS could ultimately determine thatthe refined coal facility we purchased and/or its operations have not satisfied, or have not continued to satisfy, the conditionsset forth in IRC Section 45. As our refined coal operation is expected to generate pre-tax losses, the unavailability of the taxcredits for any reason could have a material impact on our results of operations. IRC Section 45 phase out provisions. IRC Section 45 contains phase out provisionsbased upon the market price of coal such that, if the price of coal rises to specified levels, we could lose some or all of thetax credits we expect to receive from this operation. The refined coal operation dependson one customer. The refined coal operation receives taxcredits by selling its refined coal to an unrelated party. The unrelated party is not obligated to continue purchasing refinedcoal from us. Our user of refined coal could convert its fuel source to natural gas or oil instead of coal depending on the priceof natural gas and/or oil relative to that of coal. If the unrelated party ceases to purchase refined coal from us, we would attemptto move our refined coal plant to a different location, which could require us to invest additional capital, or to find a differentuser to purchase our refined coal. In addition, we may not be able to find a suitable location to move our refined coal plantto or find a different user to purchase our refined coal in a timely manner. Market demand for coal may also decline as a resultof an economic slowdown. Sustained low natural gas prices may also cause users of coal to phase out or close existing coal usingoperations. If users of coal burn less coal or eliminate the use of coal there would be less need for our product. A reductionor cessation of refined coal sales could have a material impact on our results of operations. Environmental concerns regarding coalcould lead to reduced or suspended refined coal operations.  Environmental concerns about greenhousegases, toxic wastewater discharges and the potential hazardous nature of coal combustion waste could lead to regulations thatdiscourage the burning of coal. Such regulations could mandate that electric power generating companies purchase a minimum amountof power18from renewable energy sources such aswind, hydroelectric, solar and geothermal. This could result in utilities burning less coal, which could have a material impacton our results of operations. The refined coal operation in which we have invested andthe by-products from such operations may result in environmental and product liability claims and environmental compliance costs. The construction and operation of refinedcoal operations are subject to Federal, state and local laws, regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relatingto the protection or preservation of the environment, natural resources and human health and safety. Such laws and regulationsgenerally require the operations and/or the utilities at which the operations are located to obtain and comply with various environmentalregistrations, licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Such laws and regulations also impose liability, without regardto fault or the legality of a party’s conduct, on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to, or are otherwiseinvolved in, the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment. Such hazardous substances could bereleased as a result of burning refined coal in a number of ways, including air emissions, waste water, and by-products such asfly ash. One party may, under certain circumstances, be required to bear more than its share or the entire share of investigationand cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtained from other responsible parties. We may be exposedto the risk of becoming liable for environmental damage we may have had little, if any, involvement in creating. Such risk remainseven after production ceases at an operation to the extent the environmental damage can be traced to the types of chemicals orcompounds used or operations conducted in connection with the use of refined coal. No assurances can be given that contractualarrangements and precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators will result in that facilityowner or operator accepting full responsibility for any environmental damage. It is also not uncommon for private claims by thirdparties alleging contamination to also include claims for personal injury, property damage, diminution of property or similarclaims. Furthermore, many environmental, health and safety laws authorize citizen suits,permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits and force compliance. Our insurance may not cover allenvironmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of an environmental claim. If significant uninsuredlosses arise from environmental damage or product liability claims, or if the costs of environmental compliance increase for anyreason, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. We rely on a third party to operate the refined coal facility. We rely on an unrelated third party tooperate the refined coal plant. Should the third party fail to perform or underperform in the operation, management or regulatorycompliance of the facility, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected as we are not experiencedin operating a refined coal facility. We will have to generate taxable incometo utilize the Section 45 federal income tax credits. If we do not generate sufficient taxableincome to utilize the tax credits earned by our refined coal operation, we could incur write-offs of the related tax attributeswhich could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, this could adversely reduce our liquidityreserves as we expect to incur operating losses sustained by the refined coal operation.19Risks Related to our eSteam investment eSteam may not be a commercially viabletechnology. During fiscal year 2013, we invested ineSteam, a new technology utilizing steam to extract deep heavy oil. Cumulatively, we have spent approximately $1.8 million onthis patented but unproven technology. To date, we have not tested or proven the viability of the technology. In addition, lowenergy and crude oil prices may make eSteam technology less attractive to potential users. If we cannot demonstrate that the technologyis commercially feasible, we may incur additional losses. eSteam testing methods and resultsare not known. We do not have specific testing methodologiesor specifications developed for testing the viability of the eSteam technology. The actual eSteam testing process could resultin injury to others, and property and other damages that could expose us to claims for damages from unrelated parties. Our eSteam technology may be subjectto patent challenges. If our patents of the eSteam technologyare challenged, we could be required to spend considerable time and resources defending our patents. Operations utilizing our eSteam technologymay be subject to stringent environmental regulations. Use of the eSteam technology will requiresignificant amounts of water and energy. If we or third parties are unable to obtain the proper permits and sources of water andenergy, then we may not be able to commercialize the new technology, and thus, generate any revenue from our investment. Operations utilizing our eSteam technologymay cause environmental damage. When testing and operating the eSteamtechnology, we may cause environmental damage, as we would be injecting water into the ground in order to extract oil. We couldbe subject to significant penalties and fines if we were to cause environmental damage. Risks Related to REX and non-industryspecific matters. We have concentrations of cash depositsat financial institutions that exceed federal insurance limits.  We generally have cash deposits that exceedfederal insurance limits. Should the financial institutions we deposit our cash in experience insolvency or other financial difficulty,our access to cash deposits could be limited. In extreme cases, we could lose our cash deposits entirely. This would negativelyimpact our liquidity and results of operations. We may fail to realize the anticipatedbenefits of mergers, acquisitions, or other investments. We intend to continue seeking growth opportunities.Acquisitions and similar transactions involve many risks that could harm our business, which include:  •The anticipated benefits of these transactions    may not be fully realized, or take longer to realize than expected, •Future acquisitions could result in operating losses    or loss of investment,20 •Future acquisitions may involve incurring    debt to complete these transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.  "
13,REX,REX AMERICAN RESOURCES CORP,2017-03-27,"Risk Factors
 We encourage you to carefully consider therisks described below and other information contained in this report when considering an investment decision in REX common stock.Any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If one or more of these events do occur, our results of operations,financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In this instance, the trading price of REX stock coulddecline, and investors might lose all or part of their investment. We have concentrations of cash depositsat financial institutions that exceed federal insurance limits.  We generally have cash deposits that exceedfederal insurance limits. Should the financial institutions we deposit our cash in experience insolvency or other financial difficulty,our access to cash deposits could be limited. In extreme cases, we could lose our cash deposits entirely. This would negativelyimpact our liquidity and results of operations. The current interest rate environment hasresulted in lower yields on our excess cash. We have experienced lower yields on our excesscash compared to historical yields. Should the present economic conditions result in a sustained period of historically low interestrates, our interest income would be negatively impacted. Risks Related to our Alternative EnergyBusiness The ethanol industry is changing rapidlywhich could result in unexpected developments that could negatively impact our operations. According to the RFA, the ethanol industryhas grown from approximately 1.5 billion gallons of domestic annual ethanol production in 1999 to approximately 15.3 billion gallonsin 2016. Thus, there have been significant changes in the supply and demand of ethanol over a relatively short period of time whichcould lead to difficulty in maintaining profitable operations at our ethanol plants.7We operate in a capital intensive industry.Limitations to external financing could adversely affect our financial performance. We may need to incur additional financing tofund growth of our business or in times of increasing liquidity requirements (such as increases in raw material costs). Bankruptcyfilings by several ethanol companies in past years and capital market volatility has reduced available capital for the ethanolindustry. Any delays in obtaining additional financing, or our inability to do so, could have a material adverse impact on ourfinancial results. The financial returns on our ethanol investmentsare highly dependent on commodity prices, which are subject to significant volatility and uncertainty, and the availability ofsupplies, so our results could fluctuate substantially. The financial returns onour ethanol investments are highly dependent on commodity prices, especially prices for corn, natural gas, ethanol, dried distillersgrains, non-food grade corn oil and unleaded gasoline. As a result of the volatility of the prices for these items, the returnsmay fluctuate substantially and our investments could experience periods of declining prices for their products and increasingcosts for their raw materials, which could result in operating losses at our ethanol plants. Our returns on ethanolinvestments are highly sensitive to grain prices.  Corn is the principal raw material our ethanol plants use to produceethanol and co-products. As a result, changes in the price of corn can significantly affect our businesses. Rising corn pricesresult in higher production costs of ethanol and co-products. Because ethanol competes with non-corn-based fuels, our ethanol plantsmay not be able to pass along increased grain costs to our customers. At certain levels, grain prices may make ethanol uneconomicalto produce. The price of corn is influencedby weather conditions and other factors affecting crop yields, transportation costs, farmer planting decisions, exports, the valueof the U.S. dollar and general economic, market and regulatory factors. These factors include government policies and subsidieswith respect to agriculture and international trade and global and local demand and supply. The significance and relative effectof these factors on the price of corn is difficult to predict. Any event that tends to negatively affect the supply of corn, suchas adverse weather or crop disease, could increase corn prices and potentially harm the business of our ethanol plants. Increasingdomestic ethanol capacity could boost the demand for corn and result in increased corn prices. Much of the Midwestern United Statesexperienced drought conditions during 2012 which led to a smaller harvest of corn and increased corn prices. Our ethanol plantsmay also have difficulty, from time to time, in physically sourcing corn on economical terms due to regional supply shortages.Such a shortage could require our ethanol plants to suspend operations which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidatedresults of operations. The spread betweenethanol and corn prices can vary significantly. The gross margin at our ethanol plants depends principally on the spreadbetween ethanol and corn prices. Fluctuations in the spread are likely to continue to occur. A sustained narrow or negative spread,whether as a result of sustained high or increased corn prices or sustained low or decreased ethanol prices, would adversely affectthe results of operations at our ethanol plants.8Our risk managementstrategies may be ineffective and may expose us to decreased profitability and liquidity. In an attempt to partially offsetthe impact of volatility of commodity prices, we enter into forward contracts to sell a portion of our ethanol and distillers grainsproduction and to purchase a portion of our corn and natural gas requirements. The financial impact of these risk management activitiesis dependent upon, among other items, the prices involved and our ability to receive or deliver the commodities involved. Riskmanagement activities can result in financial loss when positions are purchased in a declining market or when positions are soldin an increasing market. In addition, we may not be able to match the appropriate quantity of corn contracts with quantities ofethanol, distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil contracts. We vary the amount of risk management techniques we utilize,and we may choose not to engage in any risk management activities. Should we fail to properly manage the inherent volatility ofcommodities prices, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. The market for naturalgas is subject to market conditions that create uncertainty in the price and availability of the natural gas that our ethanol plantsuse in their manufacturing process. Our ethanol plants rely upon third parties for their supply of natural gas, which isconsumed as fuel in the production process. The prices for and availability of natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions.These market conditions often are affected by factors beyond the ethanol plants’ control, such as weather conditions, overalleconomic conditions and foreign and domestic governmental regulation and relations. Significant disruptions in the supply of naturalgas could impair or completely prevent the ethanol plants’ ability to economically manufacture ethanol for their customers.Furthermore, increases in natural gas prices or changes in our natural gas costs relative to natural gas costs paid by competitorsmay adversely affect results of operations and financial position at our ethanol plants. Fluctuations in the selling price ofcommodities may reduce profit margins at our ethanol plants. Ethanol is marketed as a fuel additive to reduce vehicle emissionsfrom gasoline, as an octane enhancer to improve the octane rating of gasoline with which it is blended and, to a lesser extent,as a gasoline substitute. As a result, ethanol prices are influenced by the supply and demand for gasoline and our ethanol plants’results of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected if gasoline demand or prices decrease. Distillers grains compete with other proteinbased animal feed products. The price of distillers grains may decrease when the prices of competing feed products decrease. Theprices of competing animal feed products are based in part on the prices of the commodities from which their products are made.Historically, sales prices for distillers grains have tracked along with the price of corn. However, there have been instanceswhen the price increase for distillers grains has lagged price increases in corn prices. The production of distillers grains has increasedas a result of increases in dry mill ethanol production in the United States. This could lead to price declines in what we cansell our distillers grains for in the future. Such declines could have an adverse material effect on our results of operations. Increased ethanol productionor decreases in demand for ethanol may result in excess production capacity in the ethanol industry, which may cause the priceof ethanol, distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil to decrease.  According to the RFA,domestic ethanol production capacity is approximately 16.0 billion gallons per year at January 2017. The RFA estimates that,as of January 2017, approximately 91 million gallons per year of additional production capacity is under construction orexpansion. In addition, certain operating plants have qualified as efficient ethanol producers through the EPA pathwayassessment, and are expanding, or planning to expand their capacity. The EPA set the RFS requirement to be satisfied by cornderived ethanol at 15.0 billion gallons for 2017. The Trump administration imposed a government wide freeze on new andpending regulations which includes the 2017 RFS requirement. The freeze expired on March 21, 2017 with no change tothe previously announced requirement. Excess capacity in the ethanol industry could have an adverse effect on the results ofour operations. In a manufacturing industry with excess capacity, producers have an incentive to manufacture additionalproducts for so long as the price exceeds the marginal cost of production (i.e., the cost of producing only the next unit,without regard for interest, overhead or fixed costs). This incentive could result in the reduction of the market price ofethanol to a level that is inadequate to generate sufficient cash flow to cover costs.9Excess capacity may alsoresult from decreases in the demand for ethanol, which could result from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, regulatorydevelopments and reduced U.S. gasoline consumption. Reduced gasoline consumption could occur as a result of increased prices forgasoline or crude oil, which could cause businesses and consumers to reduce driving or acquire vehicles with more favorable gasolinemileage or acquire hybrid vehicles. In addition, because ethanolproduction produces distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil as co-products, increased ethanol production will also lead toincreased supplies of distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil. An increase in the supply of distillers grains and non-foodgrade corn oil, without corresponding increases in demand, could lead to lower prices or an inability to sell our ethanol plants’distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil production. A decline in the price of distillers grains or non-food grade corn oilcould have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations. The price of ethanol and distillers grainsmay decline as a result of trade restrictions or duties on ethanol and distillers grains exports from the United States or fromunfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.  Exports of distillers grains produced in theUnited States have been increasing in recent years. However, the export market may be jeopardized if foreign governments imposetrade barriers or other measures to protect the foreign local markets. In January 2016, the China Ministry of Commerce announcedit has initiated anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations of U.S. dried distillers grains exports to China. China alsoannounced it has established anti-dumping duties on imports of U.S. dried distillers grains that range from 42.2% to 53.7% andalso established countervailing duties that range from 11.2% to 12%. If producers and exporters of distillers grains are subjectedto trade barriers when selling distillers grains to foreign customers, there may be a reduction in the price of distillers grainsin the United States. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could reduce the demand for United States exportsof distillers grains. Declines in the price we receive for our distillers grains could lead to decreased revenues and may resultin our inability to operate our ethanol plants profitably. The United States exported approximately onebillion gallons of ethanol in 2016. If producers and exporters of ethanol are subject to trade restrictions, or additional dutiesare imposed on exports, it may make it uneconomical to export ethanol. China raised its 5% tariff on U.S. fuel ethanol to 30%,effective January 1, 2017. Furthermore, unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates could reduce the demand for UnitedStates ethanol exports. This could result in an oversupply of ethanol in the United States which could have a material adverseeffect on the results of our ethanol operations. Future demand for ethanol is uncertain andchanges in overall consumer demand for transportation fuel could affect demand. There are limited markets for ethanol otherthat what is federally mandated. Increased consumer acceptance of E15 and E85 fuel is likely necessary in order for ethanol toachieve significant market share growth beyond federal mandate levels. We depend on our partners to operate certainof our ethanol investments. Our investments currently represent both majorityand minority equity positions. Day-to-day operating control of minority owned plants generally remains with the local farmers’cooperative or investor group that has promoted the plant. We do not have the ability to directly modify the operations of theseplants in response to changes in the business environment or in response to any deficiencies in local operations of the plants.In addition, local plant operators, who also represent the primary suppliers of corn and other crops to the plants, may have interests,such as the price and sourcing of corn and other crops, that may differ from our interest, which is based solely on the operatingprofit of the plant. The limitations on our ability to control day-to-day plant operations could adversely affect plant resultsof operations.10We may not successfully acquire or developadditional ethanol investments. The growth of our ethanolbusiness depends on our ability to identify and develop new ethanol investments. Our ethanol development strategy depends on referrals,and introductions, to new investment opportunities from industry participants, such as ethanol plant builders, financial institutions,marketing agents and others. We must continue to maintain favorable relationships with these industry participants, and a materialdisruption in these sources of referrals would adversely affect our ability to expand our ethanol investments. Any expansion strategy willdepend on prevailing market conditions for the price of ethanol and the costs of corn and natural gas and the expectations of futuremarket conditions. There is increasing competition for suitable sites for ethanol plants. Even if suitable sites or opportunitiesare identified, we may not be able to secure the services and products from contractors, engineering firms, construction firmsand equipment suppliers necessary to build or expand ethanol plants on a timely basis or on acceptable economic terms. Constructioncosts may increase to levels that would make a new plant too expensive to complete or unprofitable to operate. Additional financingmay also be necessary to implement any expansion strategy, which may not be accessible or available on acceptable terms. New andmore stringent environmental regulations could increase the operating costs and risks of new plants, which, in turn could discourageus from further expansion. In addition, failure to adequately manage the risks associated with additional ethanol investments couldhave a material adverse effect on our business. Our ethanol plants may be adversely affectedby technological advances and efforts to anticipate and employ such technological advances may prove unsuccessful.  The development and implementation of new technologiesmay result in a significant reduction in the costs of ethanol production. For instance, any technological advances in the efficiencyor cost to produce ethanol from inexpensive, cellulosic sources such as corn stalk, wheat, oat or barley straw could have an adverseeffect on our ethanol plants, because those facilities are designed to produce ethanol from corn, which is, by comparison, a rawmaterial with other high value uses. We cannot predict when new technologies may become available, the rate of acceptance of newtechnologies by competitors or the costs associated with new technologies. In addition, advances in the development of alternativesto ethanol could significantly reduce demand for or eliminate the need for ethanol. Any advances in technology which require significantunanticipated capital expenditures to remain competitive or which reduce demand or prices for ethanol would have a material adverseeffect on the results of our ethanol operations. In addition, alternative fuels, additives andoxygenates are continually under development. Alternative fuel additives that can replace ethanol may be developed, which may decreasethe demand for ethanol. It is also possible that technological advances in engine and exhaust system design and performance couldreduce the use of oxygenates, which would lower the demand for ethanol, and the results of our ethanol operations may be materiallyadversely affected.11The U.S. ethanol industry is highly dependentupon a myriad of federal and state legislation and regulation and any changes in legislation or regulation could materially andadversely affect our results of operations and financial position. The Energy Independence and Security Act of2007 (EISA) established RFS II, which modified the renewable fuel standard from prior legislation. EISA increased the amount ofrenewable fuel required to be blended into gasoline and required a minimum usage of corn derived renewable fuels of 12.0 billiongallons in 2010, increasing annually by 600 million gallons to 15.0 billion gallons in 2015. The EPA has the authority to assignthe mandated amounts of renewable fuels to be blended into transportation fuel to individual fuel blenders. RFS II has been a primaryfactor in the growth of ethanol usage. Over the past several years various pieces of legislation have been introduced to the U.S.Congress that were intended to reduce or eliminate ethanol blending requirements. Most recently, on January 3, 2017, the LeaveEthanol Volumes at Existing Levels (“LEVEL”) Act (H.R. 119) was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives. Thebill would freeze renewable fuel blending requirements under the RFS at 7.5 billion gallons per year, prohibit the sale of gasolinecontaining more than 10% ethanol, and revoke the EPA’s approval of E15 blends. On January 31, 2017, a bill (H.R. 777) wasintroduced in the U.S. House of Representatives. The bill would require the EPA and National Academies of Sciences to conduct astudy on the implication of the use of mid-level ethanol blends. A mid-level ethanol blend is an ethanol gasoline blend containing10-20% ethanol by volume, including E15 and E20, that is intended to be used in any conventional gasoline powered motor vehicleor non-road vehicle or engine. On March 2, 2017, a bill (H.R. 1315) was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives that wouldlimit the volume of ethanol in gasoline to 10%. On the same day, the RFS Elimination ACT (H.R. 1314) was introduced in the U.S.House of Representatives. The bill would fully repeal the RFS. Under EISA, the EPA has the authority to waiveor modify the mandated RFS II requirements in whole or in part. In order to grant a waiver, the EPA administrator must determinein consultation with the Secretaries of Agriculture and Energy, that one of the following two conditions has been met: i) thereis inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply or ii) implementation of the requirement would severely harm the economy or environmentof a state, region or the country. During fiscal year 2012, several waiver requests were submitted to the EPA based on droughtconditions, which were subsequently denied by the EPA. The RFS II mandate increased to 14.4 billiongallons of corn derived renewable fuel for 2014 and 15.0 billion gallons in 2015 and was to remain at that level until 2022, subsequentto which time, no specific amount was established. In November of 2013, the EPA released a proposal that included several approachesfor establishing the 2014 standards. The proposal was for approximately 15.2 billion gallons, including approximately 13.0 billiongallons of corn derived renewable fuel. The proposal addresses two constraints of RFS II: i) limitations in the volume of ethanolthat can be consumed in gasoline given the practical constraints on the supply of higher ethanol blends to the vehicles that canuse them and ii) limitations in the ability of the industry to produce sufficient volumes of qualifying renewable fuel. In November2014, the EPA rescinded its 2013 proposal. Furthermore, the EPA did not finalize the 2014 standard under the RFS program beforethe end of that year. On November 30, 2015, the EPAannounced final volume requirements for conventional ethanol of 13.61 billion gallons, 14.05 billion gallons and 14.50billion gallons for 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. In November 2016, the EPA announced the 2017 requirement of 15.0billion gallons for conventional renewable fuels which equals the original statutory requirement. The Trump administrationimposed a government wide freeze on new and pending regulations which includes the 2017 RFS requirement. The freeze expiredon March 21, 2017 with no change to the previously announced requirement. On January 18, 2017, Valero Energy Corporationfiled an action against the EPA to compel the EPA to perform certain duties required by the Clean Air Act. The filed action claimsthat the EPA has failed to perform these duties, principally, periodic reviews of the feasibility of achieving compliance withthe requirements and impact of the requirements on each individual and entity regulated under the program since 2010.12Several amendments to the Energy Policy ModernizationAct were introduced in the U.S. Senate that were removed from consideration in February 2016, including amendments to repeal RFSII, eliminate the corn ethanol mandate in RFS II and prohibit the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture from using Commodity Credit Corporationor other funds to construct blender pumps. To document compliance with RFS II, renewableidentification numbers (“RINs”), are generated and attached to renewable fuels, and detached when the renewable fuelis blended into the transportation fuel supply. Detached RINs may be retired by obligated parties to demonstrate compliance withRFS II or may be separately traded in the market. The market price of detached RINs may affect the price of ethanol in certainU.S. markets as obligated parties may factor these costs into their purchasing decisions. Moreover, at certain price levels forvarious types of RINs, it becomes more economical to import foreign sugar cane ethanol. If changes to RFS II result in significantchanges in the price of various types of RINs, it could negatively affect the price of ethanol and our ethanol business. Furthermore,in November 2016, the EPA proposed denying a petition to change the point of obligation under RFSII to the parties that own thegasoline before it is sold. The point of obligation does not directly impact ethanol producers; however, moving the point of obligationcould indirectly affect ethanol producers. The inability to generate or obtain RINscould adversely affect our operating results. Virtually all of our ethanol is sold with RINs that are used by customersto comply with RFS II. If our production does not meet EPA requirements for RIN generation in the future, we would have to purchaseRINs in the open market or sell our ethanol at substantially lower prices to adjust for the absence of RINs. The price of RINsvaries based on many factors and cannot be predicted. Failure to obtain sufficient RINS or reliance on invalid RINs could subjectus to fines and penalties imposed by the EPA. Changes in corporate average fuel economystandards could adversely impact ethanol prices. Flexible fuel vehicles receive preferential treatment in meeting federallymandated corporate average fuel economy (“CAFE”) standards for automobiles manufactured by car makers. High blend ethanolfuels such as E-85 result in lower fuel efficiencies. Absent the CAFE preferences, car makers would not likely build flexible-fuelvehicles. Any change in CAFE preferences could reduce the growth of E-85 markets and result in lower ethanol prices. Various studies have criticized the efficiencyof ethanol, in general, and corn-based ethanol in particular, which could lead to the reduction or repeal of incentives and tariffsthat promote the use and domestic production of ethanol or otherwise negatively impact public perception and acceptance of ethanolas an alternative fuel.  Although many trade groups, academics and governmentalagencies have supported ethanol as a fuel additive that promotes a cleaner environment, others have criticized ethanol productionas consuming considerably more energy and emitting more greenhouse gases than other biofuels and as potentially depleting waterresources. Other studies have suggested that corn-based ethanol is less efficient than ethanol produced from switchgrass or wheatgrain and that it negatively impacts consumers by causing prices for dairy, meat and other foodstuffs from livestock that consumecorn to increase. If these views gain acceptance, support for existing measures promoting use and domestic production of corn-basedethanol could decline, leading to reduction or repeal of these measures. These views could also negatively impact public perceptionof the ethanol industry and acceptance of ethanol as an alternative fuel.13Federal support of cellulosic ethanol mayresult in reduced incentives to corn-derived ethanol producers.  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Actof 2009 and EISA provide funding opportunities in support of cellulosic ethanol obtained from biomass sources such as switchgrassand poplar trees. The amended RFS mandates an increasing level of production of non-corn derived biofuels. These federal policiesmay suggest a long-term political preference for cellulosic processes using alternative feedstocks such as switchgrass, silageor wood chips. Cellulosic ethanol has a smaller carbon footprint and is unlikely to divert foodstuff from the market. Several cellulosicethanol plants are under development and there is a risk that cellulosic ethanol could displace corn ethanol. Our plants are designedas single-feedstock facilities, located in corn production areas with limited alternative feedstock nearby, and would require significantadditional investment to convert to the production of cellulosic ethanol. The adoption of cellulosic ethanol as the preferred formof ethanol could have a significant adverse effect on our ethanol business. Our ethanol business is affected by environmental and other regulationswhich could impede or prohibit our ability to successfully operate our plants. Our ethanol production facilities are subjectto extensive air, water and other environmental regulations. We have had to obtain numerous permits to construct and operate ourplants. Regulatory agencies could impose conditions or other restrictions in the permits that are detrimental or which increaseour costs. More stringent federal or state environmental regulations could be adopted which could significantly increase our operatingcosts or require us to expend considerable resources. Our ethanol plants emit various airborne pollutantsas by-products of the ethanol production process, including carbon dioxide. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court classified carbon dioxideas an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act in a case seeking to require the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide in vehicle emissions.In February 2010, the EPA released its final regulations on the Renewable Fuel Standard program. We believe our plants are grandfatheredat their current operating capacity, but plant expansion will need to meet a 20% threshold reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissionsfrom a 2005 baseline measurement to produce ethanol eligible for the RFS II mandate. To expand our plant capacity, we may be requiredto obtain additional permits, install advanced technology equipment, or reduce drying of certain amounts of distillers grains.We may also be required to install carbon dioxide mitigation equipment or take other steps in order to comply with future lawsor regulations. Compliance with future laws or regulations of carbon dioxide, or if we choose to expand capacity at certain ofour plants, compliance with then-current regulations of carbon dioxide, could be costly and may prevent us from operating our plantsas profitably, which may have a negative impact on our financial performance. We also face the risk of ethanol production aboveour grandfathered capacity not qualifying for RINS if the plants do not meet certain emission requirements. The California Air Resources Board (“CARB”)has adopted a Low Carbon Fuel Standard (“LCFS”) requiring a 10% reduction in GHG emissions from transportation fuelsby 2020. An Indirect Land Use Charge is included in this lifecycle GHG emission calculation. After a series of rulings that temporarilyprevented CARB from enforcing these regulations, the State of California Office of Administrative Law approved the LCFS on November26, 2012 and revised LCFS regulations took effect in January 2013. This standard could have an adverse impact on the market forcorn-based ethanol in California if corn-based ethanol fails to achieve lifecycle GHG emission reductions. This could have a negativeimpact on our financial performance. Our ethanol business may become subjectto various environmental and health and safety and property damage claims and liabilities.  Operations of our ethanol business will exposethe business to the risk of environmental and health and safety claims and property damage claims, such as failure to comply withenvironmental regulations. These types of claims could also be made against our ethanol business based upon the acts or omissionsof other persons. Serious claims could have a material negative impact on our results of operations, financial position and futurecash flows.14Our business is not significantly diversified. Our financial results depend heavily on ourability to operate our ethanol plants profitably. We do not have other lines of business or other sources of revenue to dependupon if we are unable to operate our ethanol plants profitably. Such lack of significant diversification could have a materialnegative impact on our results of operations, financial position and future cash flows should our ethanol plants operate unprofitably. We may have commitments to produce and sellethanol. We may, at times, sell our productswith forward contracts. If we are unable to produce the products due to economical conditions, business interruption, orother factors, we may incur additional costs or have to obtain commodities at unfavorable prices. This could have a materialadverse effect on our results of operations. Our revenue from the sale of distillersgrains depends upon its continued market acceptance as an animal feed. Distillers grains is a co-product from thefermentation of corn to produce ethanol. Antibiotics may be used during the fermentation process to control bacterial contamination;therefore antibiotics may be present in small quantities in distillers grains marketed as animal feed. The U. S. Food and DrugAdministration’s Center for Veterinary Medicine has expressed concern about potential animal and human health hazards from theuse of distillers grains as an animal feed due to the possibility of antibiotic residues. If the public became concerned aboutthe impact of distillers grains in the food supply or as an acceptable animal feed, the market for distillers grains could be negativelyimpacted, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. We may not be able to obtain a suitable replacementfor antibiotics, should this be required, which would also negatively impact the market for distillers grains. Exports of distillers grains produced in theUnited States have been increasing in recent years. The price of distillers grains has benefitted from the increased exports ofthe product, with China being the largest importer. In 2013, China rejected certain shipments of distillers grains due to the presenceof unapproved genetically modified organisms. If shipments to China or other countries are rejected or delayed, the market pricefor distillers grains would be negatively impacted, which would have a negative impact on our ethanol results of operations. At certain of our plants, we extract and sellnon-food grade corn oil immediately prior to the production of distillers grains. Several studies are trying to determine how non-foodgrade corn oil extraction may impact the nutritional value of the resulting distillers grains. If it is determined that non-foodgrade corn oil extraction adversely impacts the nutritional energy content of distillers grains, the value of the distillers grainswe sell may be negatively impacted, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. We face significant competitionin the ethanol industry. We face significant competitionfor new ethanol investment opportunities. There are varied enterprises seeking to participate in the ethanol industry. Some enterprisesprovide financial and management support similar to our business model. Other enterprises seek to acquire or develop plants whichthey will directly own and operate. Many of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources and name recognitionthan we do. We must compete for investment opportunities based on our strategy of supporting and enhancing local development ofethanol plant opportunities. We may not be successful in competing for investment opportunities based on our strategy.15The ethanol industry is primarilycomprised of entities that engage exclusively in ethanol production and large integrated grain companies that produce ethanol alongwith their base grain business. Several large oil companies have entered the ethanol production market. If these companies increasetheir ethanol plant ownership or other oil companies seek to engage in direct ethanol production, there would be less of a needto purchase ethanol from independent producers like our ethanol plants. Plants sold as part of abankruptcy proceeding may have significantly lower fixed costs than our ethanol plants. Absent significant growth and diversification,our ethanol plants may not be able to operate profitably in a more competitive environment. No assurance can be given that ourethanol plants will be able to compete successfully or that competition from larger companies with greater financial resourceswill not have a materially adverse impact on the results of our ethanol operations. We may face competitionfrom foreign companies. There is a risk of foreigncompetition in the ethanol industry. Brazil is presently the second largest producer of ethanol in the world. Brazil’s ethanolproduction is sugarcane based, and, depending on feedstock prices, may be cheaper to produce. Under the RFS, certain parties wereobligated to meet an advanced biofuel standard. In recent years, sugarcane based ethanol imported from Brazil has been one of themost economical means for obligated parties to comply with this standard. If significant additionalforeign ethanol production capacity is created, such facilities could create excess supplies of ethanol, which may result in lowerprices of ethanol. In addition, foreign ethanol producers may be able to produce ethanol at costs lower than ours. These riskscould have significant adverse effects on our financial performance. In addition, the tariff thatprotected the U.S. ethanol industry expired at the end of 2011. The expiration of the tariff could lead to increases in the importof ethanol produced outside of the U.S. We are exposed to creditrisk from our sales of ethanol and distillers grains to customers. The inability of a customerto make payments to us for our accounts receivable may cause us to experience losses and may adversely impact our liquidity andour ability to make our payments when due. We may not be able tohire and retain qualified personnel to operate our ethanol plants. Our ability to attract andretain competent personnel has a significant impact on operating efficiencies and plant profitability. Competition for key plantemployees in the ethanol industry can be intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees. Failure todo so could have a negative impact on our financial results at individual plants. Our plants depend on an uninterrupted supply of energy and waterto operate. Unforeseen plant shutdowns could harm our business. Our plants require a significant and uninterruptedsupply of natural gas, electricity and water to operate. We generally rely on third parties to provide these resources. If thereis an interruption in the supply of energy or water for any reason, such as supply, delivery or mechanical problems and we areunable to secure an adequate alternative supply to sustain plant operations, we may be required to stop production. A productionhalt for an extended period of time could result in material losses.16Potential business disruption from factorsoutside our control, including natural disasters, severe weather conditions, accidents, strikes, unexpected equipment failuresand unforeseen plant shutdowns, could adversely affect our cash flow and operating results. The debt agreements for certain of the ethanolplants limit, or otherwise restrict the amount of dividends and other payments the ethanol subsidiaries can transfer to their members. We are dependent on dividends from our ethanolsubsidiaries to generate cash flow. Presently our unconsolidated ethanol subsidiary has debt agreements that limit payments tomembers. Therefore, this company cannot distribute all of the cash it generates to its members. Furthermore, we may not be ableto use the excess cash flow from one subsidiary to fund corporate needs or needs of another operating ethanol subsidiary. We rely on information technology in ouroperations and financial reporting and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security breach of that technology couldharm our ability to efficiently operate our business and report our financial results accurately and timely. We rely heavily on information technology systemsacross our operations, including for management of inventory, purchase orders, production, invoices, shipping, accounting and variousother processes and transactions. Our ability to effectively manage our business, coordinate the production, distribution and saleof our products and ensure the timely and accurate recording and disclosure of financial information depends significantly on thereliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning toupgraded or replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems through a cyber-attack or otherwise could cause delaysin product sales, reduced efficiency of our operations and delays in reporting our financial results. Significant capital investmentscould be required to remediate any such problem. Security breaches of employee information or other confidential or proprietarydata could also adversely impact our reputation, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. We are exposed to potential business disruptionfrom factors outside our control, including natural disasters, severe weather conditions, accidents, and unforeseen operationalfailures any of which could negatively affect our transportation operations and could adversely affect our cash flows and operatingresults.  Potential businessdisruption in available transportation due to natural disasters, severe weather conditions, significant track damage resultingfrom a train derailment, strikes or other interruptions by our transportation providers could result in delays in procuring andsupplying raw materials to our ethanol facilities, or transporting ethanol and distillers grains to our customers. Such businessdisruptions may result in our inability to meet customer demand or contract delivery requirements, as well as the potential lossof customers. Rail cars used to transport ethanol mayneed to be modified or replaced to meet proposed rail safety regulations. The leased rail cars we use to transport ethanolto market will need to be retrofitted or replaced as the Enhanced Tank Car Standards and Operation Controls for High-Hazard FlammableTrains adopted by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) calls for an enhanced tank car standard known as theDOT specification 117 and establishes a schedule to retrofit or replace older tank cars that carry crude oil and ethanol. The rulealso establishes braking standards intended to reduce the severity of accidents and new operational protocols. This could leadto increased rail car lease costs and delays in transportation of ethanol if rail cars are out of service for extended periodsof time.17Risks Related to our eSteam investmentsand operations. eSteam may not be commercially viable technology. During fiscal year 2013, we invested in eSteam,a new technology utilizing steam to extract deep heavy oil. Cumulatively, we have spent approximately $1.7 million on this patentedbut unproven technology. Low energy and crude oil prices may make eSteam technology less attractive to potential users. To date,we have not tested or proven the viability of the technology. If we cannot demonstrate that the technology is commercially feasible,we may incur additional losses. Our eSteam technology may be subject topatent challenges. We could be required to spend considerabletime and resources defending our technology from patent challenges. Operations utilizing our eSteam technologymay be subject to stringent environmental regulations. These operations will require significant amountsof water and energy. If we are unable to obtain the proper permits and sources of water and energy, then we may not be able tooperate the new technologies, and thus, generate any revenue. Operations utilizing our eSteam technologymay cause environmental damage. When operating the eSteam technology, we maycause environmental damage, as we would be injecting water into the ground in order to extract oil. We could be subject to significantpenalties and fines if we were to cause environmental damage. "
7,REX,REX AMERICAN RESOURCES CORP,2016-03-25,"Risk Factors
 We encourage you to carefully consider therisks described below and other information contained in this report when considering an investment decision in REX common stock.Any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If one or more of these events do occur, our results of operations,financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In this instance, the trading price of REX stock coulddecline, and investors might lose all or part of their investment. We have concentrations of cash depositsat financial institutions that exceed federal insurance limits.  We generally have cash deposits that exceedfederal insurance limits. Should the financial institutions we deposit our cash at experience insolvency or other financial difficulty,our access to cash deposits could be limited. In extreme cases, we could lose our cash deposits entirely. This would negativelyimpact our liquidity and results of operations. The current interest rate environment hasresulted in lower yields on our excess cash.  We have experienced lower yields on our excesscash compared to historical yields. Should the present economic conditions result in a sustained period of historically low interestrates, our interest income would be negatively impacted. Risks Related to our Alternative EnergyBusiness The ethanol industry is changing rapidlywhich could result in unexpected developments that could negatively impact our operations.7According to the RFA, the ethanol industry hasgrown from approximately 1.5 billion gallons of domestic annual ethanol production in 1999 to approximately 14.8 billion gallonsin 2015. Thus, there have been significant changes in the supply and demand of ethanol over a relatively short period of time whichcould lead to difficulty in maintaining profitable operations at our ethanol plants. We operate in a capital intensive industry.Limitations to external financing could adversely affect our financial performance. We may need to incur additional financing tofund growth of our business or in times of increasing liquidity requirements (such as increases in raw material costs). Bankruptcyfilings by several ethanol companies over the past several years and capital market volatility has reduced available capital forthe ethanol industry. Any delays in obtaining additional financing, or our inability to do so, could have a material adverse impacton our financial results. The financial returns on our ethanol investmentsare highly dependent on commodity prices, which are subject to significant volatility and uncertainty, and the availability ofsupplies, so our results could fluctuate substantially. The financial returns onour ethanol investments are highly dependent on commodity prices, especially prices for corn, natural gas, ethanol, dried distillersgrains, non-food grade corn oil and unleaded gasoline. As a result of the volatility of the prices for these items, the returnsmay fluctuate substantially and our investments could experience periods of declining prices for their products and increasingcosts for their raw materials, which could result in operating losses at our ethanol plants. Our returns on ethanolinvestments are highly sensitive to grain prices. Corn is the principal raw material our ethanol plants use to produceethanol and co-products. As a result, changes in the price of corn can significantly affect our businesses. Rising corn pricesresult in higher costs of ethanol and co-products. Because ethanol competes with non-corn-based fuels, our ethanol plants may notbe able to pass along increased grain costs to our customers. At certain levels, grain prices may make ethanol uneconomical toproduce. The price of corn is influencedby weather conditions and other factors affecting crop yields, transportation costs, farmer planting decisions, exports, the valueof the U.S. dollar and general economic, market and regulatory factors. These factors include government policies and subsidieswith respect to agriculture and international trade and global and local demand and supply. The significance and relative effectof these factors on the price of corn is difficult to predict. Any event that tends to negatively affect the supply of corn, suchas adverse weather or crop disease, could increase corn prices and potentially harm the business of our ethanol plants. Increasingdomestic ethanol capacity could boost the demand for corn and result in increased corn prices. Much of the Midwestern United Statesexperienced drought conditions during 2012 which led to a smaller harvest of corn and increased corn prices. Our ethanol plantsmay also have difficulty, from time to time, in physically sourcing corn on economical terms due to supply shortages. Such a shortagecould require our ethanol plants to suspend operations which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results ofoperations. The spread betweenethanol and corn prices can vary significantly. The gross margin at our ethanol plants depends principally on the spreadbetween ethanol and corn prices. Fluctuations in the spread are likely to continue to occur. A sustained narrow or negative spread,whether as a result of sustained high or increased corn prices or sustained low or decreased ethanol prices, would adversely affectthe results of operations at our ethanol plants.8Our risk management strategies may beineffective and may expose us to decreased profitability and liquidity. In an attempt to partially offset the impact ofvolatility of commodity prices, we enter into forward contracts to sell a portion of our ethanol and distillers grains productionand to purchase a portion of our corn and natural gas requirements. The financial impact of these risk management activities isdependent upon, among other items, the prices involved and our ability to receive or deliver the commodities involved. Risk managementactivities can result in financial loss when positions are purchased in a declining market or when positions are sold in an increasingmarket. In addition, we may not be able to match the appropriate quantity of corn contracts with quantities of ethanol, distillersgrains and non-food grade corn oil contracts. We vary the amount of risk management techniques we utilize, and we may choose notto engage in any risk management activities. Should we fail to properly manage the inherent volatility of commodities prices, ourresults of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. The market for naturalgas is subject to market conditions that create uncertainty in the price and availability of the natural gas that our ethanol plantsuse in their manufacturing process. Our ethanol plants rely upon third parties for their supply of natural gas, which isconsumed as fuel in the production of ethanol. The prices for and availability of natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions.These market conditions often are affected by factors beyond the ethanol plants’ control, such as weather conditions, overalleconomic conditions and foreign and domestic governmental regulation and relations. Significant disruptions in the supply of naturalgas could impair or completely prevent the ethanol plants’ ability to economically manufacture ethanol for their customers.Furthermore, increases in natural gas prices or changes in our natural gas costs relative to natural gas costs paid by competitorsmay adversely affect results of operations and financial position at our ethanol plants. Fluctuations in the selling price ofcommodities may reduce profit margins at our ethanol plants. Ethanol is marketed as a fuel additive to reduce vehicle emissionsfrom gasoline, as an octane enhancer to improve the octane rating of gasoline with which it is blended and, to a lesser extent,as a gasoline substitute. As a result, ethanol prices are influenced by the supply and demand for gasoline and our ethanol plants’results of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected if gasoline demand or prices decrease. Distillers grains compete with other proteinbased animal feed products. The price of distillers grains may decrease when the prices of competing feed products decrease. Theprices of competing animal feed products are based in part on the prices of the commodities from which their products are made.Historically, sales prices for distillers grains have tracked along with the price of corn. However, there have been instanceswhen the price increase for distillers grains has lagged price increases in corn prices. The production of distillers grains has increasedas a result of increases in dry mill ethanol production in the United States. This could lead to price declines in what we cansell our distillers grains for in the future. Such declines could have an adverse material effect on our results of operations. Increased ethanol productionor decreases in demand for ethanol may result in excess production capacity in the ethanol industry, which may cause the priceof ethanol, distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil to decrease. According to the RFA, domesticethanol production nameplate capacity is approximately 15.6 billion gallons per year at January 2016. The RFA estimates that, asof January 2016, approximately 162 million gallons per year of additional production capacity is under construction or expansion.In addition, certain operating plants have qualified as efficient ethanol producers through the EPA pathway assessment, and areexpanding, or planning to expand their capacity. The EPA set the RFS requirement to be satisfied by corn derived ethanol at 14.5billion gallons for 2016. Excess capacity in the ethanol industry could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations.In a manufacturing industry with excess capacity, producers9have an incentive to manufactureadditional products for so long as the price exceeds the marginal cost of production (i.e., the cost of producing only the nextunit, without regard for interest, overhead or fixed costs). This incentive could result in the reduction of the market price ofethanol to a level that is inadequate to generate sufficient cash flow to cover costs. Excess capacity may alsoresult from decreases in the demand for ethanol, which could result from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, regulatorydevelopments and reduced U.S. gasoline consumption. Reduced gasoline consumption could occur as a result of increased prices forgasoline or crude oil, which could cause businesses and consumers to reduce driving or acquire vehicles with more favorable gasolinemileage or acquire hybrid vehicles. In addition, because ethanolproduction produces distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil as co-products, increased ethanol production will also lead toincreased supplies of distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil. An increase in the supply of distillers grains and non-foodgrade corn oil, without corresponding increases in demand, could lead to lower prices or an inability to sell our ethanol plants’distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil production. A decline in the price of distillers grains or non-food grade corn oilcould have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations. Trade restrictions on ethanol exports andunfavorable foreign currency exchange rates could reduce the demand for ethanol. The United States exported approximately 844million gallons of ethanol in 2015. If producers and exporters of ethanol are subject to trade restrictions, or additional dutiesare imposed on exports, it may make it uneconomical to export ethanol. Furthermore, unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchangerates could reduce the demand for United States ethanol exports. This could result in an oversupply of ethanol in the United Stateswhich could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations. We depend on our partners to operate certainof our ethanol investments. Our investments currently represent both majorityand minority equity positions. Day-to-day operating control of minority owned plants generally remains with the local farmers’cooperative or investor group that has promoted the plant. We do not have the ability to directly modify the operations of theseplants in response to changes in the business environment or in response to any deficiencies in local operations of the plants.In addition, local plant operators, who also represent the primary suppliers of corn and other crops to the plants, may have interests,such as the price and sourcing of corn and other crops, that may differ from our interest, which is based solely on the operatingprofit of the plant. The limitations on our ability to control day-to-day plant operations could adversely affect plant resultsof operations. We may not successfully acquire or developadditional ethanol investments. The growth of our ethanolbusiness depends on our ability to identify and develop new ethanol investments. Our ethanol development strategy depends on referrals,and introductions, to new investment opportunities from industry participants, such as ethanol plant builders, financial institutions,marketing agents and others. We must continue to maintain favorable relationships with these industry participants, and a materialdisruption in these sources of referrals would adversely affect our ability to expand our ethanol investments. Any expansion strategy willdepend on prevailing market conditions for the price of ethanol and the costs of corn and natural gas and the expectations of futuremarket conditions. There is increasing competition for suitable sites for ethanol plants. Even if suitable sites or opportunitiesare identified, we may not be able to secure the services and products from contractors, engineering firms, construction firmsand equipment10suppliers necessary to buildor expand ethanol plants on a timely basis or on acceptable economic terms. Construction costs associated with expansion may increaseto levels that would make a new plant too expensive to complete or unprofitable to operate. Additional financing may also be necessaryto implement any expansion strategy, which may not be accessible or available on acceptable terms. New and more stringent environmentalregulations could increase the operating costs and risks of new plants, which, in turn could discourage us from further expansion. Our ethanol plants may be adversely affectedby technological advances and efforts to anticipate and employ such technological advances may prove unsuccessful. The development and implementation of new technologiesmay result in a significant reduction in the costs of ethanol production. For instance, any technological advances in the efficiencyor cost to produce ethanol from inexpensive, cellulosic sources such as corn stalk, wheat, oat or barley straw could have an adverseeffect on our ethanol plants, because those facilities are designed to produce ethanol from corn, which is, by comparison, a rawmaterial with other high value uses. We cannot predict when new technologies may become available, the rate of acceptance of newtechnologies by competitors or the costs associated with new technologies. In addition, advances in the development of alternativesto ethanol could significantly reduce demand for or eliminate the need for ethanol. Any advances in technology which require significantunanticipated capital expenditures to remain competitive or which reduce demand or prices for ethanol would have a material adverseeffect on the results of our ethanol operations. In addition, alternative fuels, additives andoxygenates are continually under development. Alternative fuel additives that can replace ethanol may be developed, which may decreasethe demand for ethanol. It is also possible that technological advances in engine and exhaust system design and performance couldreduce the use of oxygenates, which would lower the demand for ethanol, and the results of our ethanol operations may be materiallyadversely affected. The U.S. ethanol industry is highly dependentupon a myriad of federal and state legislation and regulation and any changes in legislation or regulation could materially andadversely affect our results of operations and financial position. The Energy Independence and Security Act of2007 (EISA) established RFS II, which modified the renewable fuel standard from prior legislation. EISA increased the amount ofrenewable fuel required to be blended into gasoline and required a minimum usage of corn derived renewable fuels of 12.0 billiongallons in 2010, increasing annually by 600 million gallons to 15.0 billion gallons in 2015. The EPA has the authority to assignthe mandated amounts of renewable fuels to be blended into transportation fuel to individual fuel blenders. RFS II has been a primaryfactor in the growth of ethanol usage. On April 10, 2013, the Renewable Fuel Standard Elimination Act was introduced as H.R. 1461to target the repeal of RFS II. Also introduced on April 10, 2013 was the RFS Reform Bill, H.R. 1462, which would prohibit morethan ten percent ethanol in gasoline and reduce the RFS II required volume of renewable fuel. On May 14, 2013, the Domestic AlternativesFuels Act of 2013 was introduced in the United States House of Representatives as H.R. 1959 to permit ethanol produced from naturalgas to be used to meet the RFS II mandate. These bills failed to make it out of congressional committees and were not finalizedinto law. H.R. 21 was introduced on January 6, 2015 to provide for a comprehensive assessment of the scientific and technical researchon the implication of the use of mid-level ethanol blends. This bill seeks to eliminate the waiver granted by the EPA to allowE15 fuel in 2001 and newer model cars and trucks. H.R. 434 was introduced on January 21, 2015 which seeks to modify the Clean AirAct by limiting or removing the authority of the EPA to grant waivers for higher blends of ethanol in domestic gasoline supply.This bill also repeals existing waivers11already granted by the EPA regarding E15 fuel.H.R. 704 was introduced February 4, 2015 and it is similar to H.R. 21 as it proposes limiting ethanol blends higher than 10% indomestic fuel supply and seeks to repeal the RFS. Under EISA, the EPA has the authority to waiveor modify the mandated RFS II requirements in whole or in part. In order to grant a waiver, the EPA administrator must determinein consultation with the Secretaries of Agriculture and Energy, that one of the following two conditions has been met: i) thereis inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply or ii) implementation of the requirement would severely harm the economy or environmentof a state, region or the country. During fiscal year 2012, several waiver requests were submitted to the EPA based on droughtconditions, which were subsequently denied by the EPA. The RFS II mandate increased to 14.4 billiongallons of corn derived renewable fuel for 2014 and 15.0 billion gallons in 2015 and was to remain at that level until 2022, subsequentto which time, no specific amount was established. In November of 2013, the EPA released a proposal that included several approachesfor establishing the 2014 standards. The proposal was for approximately 15.2 billion gallons, including approximately 13.0 billiongallons of corn derived renewable fuel. The proposal addresses two constraints of RFS II: i) limitations in the volume of ethanolthat can be consumed in gasoline given the practical constraints on the supply of higher ethanol blends to the vehicles that canuse them and ii) limitations in the ability of the industry to produce sufficient volumes of qualifying renewable fuel. In November2014, the EPA rescinded its 2013 proposal. Furthermore, the EPA did not finalize the 2014 standard under the RFS program beforethe end of that year. On June 10, 2015, the EPA proposed volume targetsfor conventional ethanol of 13.25 billion gallons, 13.40 billion gallons and 14.00 billion gallons for 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.On November 30, 2015, the EPA announced final volume requirements for conventional ethanol that were higher than levels proposedin June of 13.61 billion gallons, 14.05 billion gallons and 14.50 billion gallons for 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. The EPAhas not announced its proposed volume requirements for subsequent years. To document compliance with RFS II, renewableidentification numbers (“RINs”), are generated and attached to renewable fuels, and detached when the renewable fuelis blended into the transportation fuel supply. Detached RINs may be retired by obligated parties to demonstrate compliance withRFS II or may be separately traded in the market. The market price of detached RINs may affect the price of ethanol in certainU.S. markets as obligated parties may factor these costs into their purchasing decisions. Moreover, at certain price levels forvarious types of RINs, it becomes more economical to import foreign sugar cane ethanol. If changes to RFS II result in significantchanges in the price of various types of RINs, it could negatively affect the price of ethanol and our ethanol business. Changes in corporate average fuel economystandards could adversely impact ethanol prices. Flexible fuel vehicles receive preferential treatment in meeting federallymandated corporate average fuel economy (“CAFE”) standards for automobiles manufactured by car makers. High blend ethanolfuels such as E-85 result in lower fuel efficiencies. Absent the CAFE preferences, car makers would not likely build flexible-fuelvehicles. Any change in CAFE preferences could reduce the growth of E-85 markets and result in lower ethanol prices. Various studies have criticized the efficiencyof ethanol, in general, and corn-based ethanol in particular, which could lead to the reduction or repeal of incentives and tariffsthat promote the use and domestic production of ethanol or otherwise negatively impact public perception and acceptance of ethanolas an alternative fuel.12Although many trade groups, academics and governmentalagencies have supported ethanol as a fuel additive that promotes a cleaner environment, others have criticized ethanol productionas consuming considerably more energy and emitting more greenhouse gases than other biofuels and as potentially depleting waterresources. Other studies have suggested that corn-based ethanol is less efficient than ethanol produced from switchgrass or wheatgrain and that it negatively impacts consumers by causing prices for dairy, meat and other foodstuffs from livestock that consumecorn to increase. If these views gain acceptance, support for existing measures promoting use and domestic production of corn-basedethanol could decline, leading to reduction or repeal of these measures. These views could also negatively impact public perceptionof the ethanol industry and acceptance of ethanol as an alternative fuel. Federal support of cellulosic ethanol mayresult in reduced incentives to corn-derived ethanol producers. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Actof 2009 and EISA provide funding opportunities in support of cellulosic ethanol obtained from biomass sources such as switchgrassand poplar trees. The amended RFS mandates an increasing level of production of non-corn derived biofuels. These federal policiesmay suggest a long-term political preference for cellulosic processes using alternative feedstocks such as switchgrass, silageor wood chips. Cellulosic ethanol has a smaller carbon footprint and is unlikely to divert foodstuff from the market. Several cellulosicethanol plants are under development and there is a risk that cellulosic ethanol could displace corn ethanol. Our plants are designedas single-feedstock facilities, located in corn production areas with limited alternative feedstock nearby, and would require significantadditional investment to convert to the production of cellulosic ethanol. The adoption of cellulosic ethanol as the preferred formof ethanol could have a significant adverse effect on our ethanol business. Our ethanol business is affected by environmental and other regulationswhich could impede or prohibit our ability to successfully operate our plants. Our ethanol production facilities are subjectto extensive air, water and other environmental regulations. We have had to obtain numerous permits to construct and operate ourplants. Regulatory agencies could impose conditions or other restrictions in the permits that are detrimental or which increaseour costs. More stringent federal or state environmental regulations could be adopted which could significantly increase our operatingcosts or require us to expend considerable resources. Our ethanol plants emit various airborne pollutantsas by-products of the ethanol production process, including carbon dioxide. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court classified carbon dioxideas an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act in a case seeking to require the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide in vehicle emissions.In February 2010, the EPA released its final regulations on the Renewable Fuel Standard program. We believe our plants are grandfatheredat their current operating capacity, but plant expansion will need to meet a 20% threshold reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissionsfrom a 2005 baseline measurement to produce ethanol eligible for the RFS II mandate. To expand our plant capacity, we may be requiredto obtain additional permits, install advanced technology equipment, or reduce drying of certain amounts of distillers grains.We may also be required to install carbon dioxide mitigation equipment or take other steps in order to comply with future lawsor regulations. Compliance with future laws or regulations of carbon dioxide, or if we choose to expand capacity at certain ofour plants, compliance with then-current regulations of carbon dioxide, could be costly and may prevent us from operating our plantsas profitably, which may have a negative impact on our financial performance. We also face the risk of ethanol production aboveour grandfathered capacity not qualifying for RINS if the plants do not meet certain emission requirements. The California Air Resources Board (“CARB”)has adopted a Low Carbon Fuel Standard (“LCFS”) requiring a 10% reduction in GHG emissions from transportation fuelsby 2020. An Indirect Land Use13Charge is included in this lifecycle GHG emissioncalculation. After a series of rulings that temporarily prevented CARB from enforcing these regulations, the State of CaliforniaOffice of Administrative Law approved the LCFS on November 26, 2012 and revised LCFS regulations took effect in January 2013. Thisstandard could have an adverse impact on the market for corn-based ethanol in California if corn-based ethanol fails to achievelifecycle GHG emission reductions. This could have a negative impact on our financial performance. Our ethanol business may become subjectto various environmental and health and safety and property damage claims and liabilities. Operations of our ethanol business will exposethe business to the risk of environmental and health and safety claims and property damage claims, such as failure to comply withenvironmental regulations. These types of claims could also be made against our ethanol business based upon the acts or omissionsof other persons. Serious claims could have a material negative impact on our results of operations, financial position and futurecash flows. Our business is not significantly diversified. Our financial results depend heavily on ourability to operate our ethanol plants profitably. We do not have other lines of business or other sources of revenue to dependupon if we are unable to operate our ethanol plants profitably. Such lack of significant diversification could have a materialnegative impact on our results of operations, financial position and future cash flows should our ethanol plants operate unprofitably. Our revenue from the sale of distillersgrains depends upon its continued market acceptance as an animal feed. Distillers grains is a co-product from thefermentation of corn to produce ethanol. Antibiotics may be used during the fermentation process to control bacterial contamination;therefore antibiotics may be present in small quantities in distillers grains marketed as animal feed. The U. S. Food and DrugAdministration’s, or FDA’s, Center for Veterinary Medicine has expressed concern about potential animal and human healthhazards from the use of distillers grains as an animal feed due to the possibility of antibiotic residues. If the public becameconcerned about the impact of distillers grains in the food supply or as an acceptable animal feed, the market for distillers grainscould be negatively impacted, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. We may not be able to obtain a suitablereplacement for antibiotics, should this be required, which would also negatively impact the market for distillers grains. Exports of distillers grains produced in theUnited States have been increasing in recent years. The price of distillers grains has benefitted from the increased exports ofthe product, with China being the largest importer. In 2013, China rejected certain shipments of distillers grains due to the presenceof unapproved genetically modified organisms. If shipments to China or other countries are rejected or delayed, the market pricefor distillers grains would be negatively impacted, which would have a negative impact on our ethanol results of operations. At certain of our plants, we extract and sellnon-food grade corn oil immediately prior to the production of distillers grains. Several studies are trying to determine how non-foodgrade corn oil extraction may impact the nutritional value of the resulting distillers grains. If it is determined that non-foodgrade corn oil extraction adversely impacts the nutritional energy content of distillers grains, the value of the distillers grainswe sell may be negatively impacted, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations.14The price of distillers grains may declineas a result of restrictions or duties on distillers grains exports from the United States or from unfavorable changes in foreigncurrency exchange rates. Exports of distillers grains produced in theUnited States have been increasing in recent years. However, the export market may be jeopardized if foreign governments imposetrade barriers or other measures to protect the foreign local markets. In January 2016, the China’ Ministry of Commerce announcedit has initiated anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations of U.S. dried distillers grains exports to China. If producersand exporters of distillers grains are subjected to trade barriers when selling distillers grains to foreign customers, there maybe a reduction in the price of distillers grains in the United States. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuationscould reduce the demand for United States exports of distillers grains. Declines in the price we receive for our distillers grainscould lead to decreased revenues and may result in our inability to operate our ethanol plants profitably. We face significant competitionin the ethanol industry. We face significant competitionfor new ethanol investment opportunities. There are varied enterprises seeking to participate in the ethanol industry. Some enterprisesprovide financial and management support similar to our business model. Other enterprises seek to acquire or develop plants whichthey will directly own and operate. Many of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources and name recognitionthan we do. We must compete for investment opportunities based on our strategy of supporting and enhancing local development ofethanol plant opportunities. We may not be successful in competing for investment opportunities based on our strategy. The ethanol industry is primarilycomprised of entities that engage exclusively in ethanol production and large integrated grain companies that produce ethanol alongwith their base grain business. Several large oil companies have entered the ethanol production market. If these companies increasetheir ethanol plant ownership or other oil companies seek to engage in direct ethanol production, there would be less of a needto purchase ethanol from independent producers like our ethanol plants. Plants sold as part of abankruptcy proceeding may have significantly lower fixed costs than our ethanol plants. Absent significant growth and diversification,our ethanol plants may not be able to operate profitably in a more competitive environment. No assurance can be given that ourethanol plants will be able to compete successfully or that competition from larger companies with greater financial resourceswill not have a materially adverse impact on the results of our ethanol operations. We may face competitionfrom foreign companies. There is a risk of foreigncompetition in the ethanol industry. Brazil is presently the second largest producer of ethanol in the world. Brazil’s ethanolproduction is sugarcane based, and, depending on feedstock prices, may be cheaper to produce. Under the RFS, certain parties wereobligated to meet an advanced biofuel standard. In recent years, sugarcane based ethanol imported from Brazil has been one of themost economical means for obligated parties to comply with this standard. If significant additionalforeign ethanol production capacity is created, such facilities could create excess supplies of ethanol, which may result in lowerprices of ethanol. In addition, foreign ethanol producers may be able to produce ethanol at costs lower than ours. These riskscould have significant adverse effects on our financial performance. In addition, the tariff thatprotected the U.S. ethanol industry expired at the end of 2011. The expiration of the tariff could lead to increases in the importof ethanol produced outside of the U.S.15We are exposed to creditrisk from our sales of ethanol and distillers grains to customers. The inability of a customerto make payments to us for our accounts receivable may cause us to experience losses and may adversely impact our liquidity andour ability to make our payments when due. We may not be able tohire and retain qualified personnel to operate our ethanol plants. Our ability to attract andretain competent personnel has a significant impact on operating efficiencies and plant profitability. Competition for key plantemployees in the ethanol industry can be intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees. Failure todo so could have a negative impact on our financial results at individual plants. Our plants depend on an uninterrupted supply of energy and waterto operate. Unforeseen plant shutdowns could harm our business.  Our plants require a significant and uninterruptedsupply of natural gas, electricity and water to operate. We generally rely on third parties to provide these resources. If thereis an interruption in the supply of energy or water for any reason, such as supply, delivery or mechanical problems and we areunable to secure an adequate alternative supply to sustain plant operations, we may be required to stop production. A productionhalt for an extended period of time could result in material losses. Potential business disruption from factorsoutside our control, including natural disasters, severe weather conditions, accidents, strikes, unexpected equipment failuresand unforeseen plant shutdowns, could adversely affect our cash flow and operating results. The debt agreements for certain of the ethanolplants limit, or otherwise restrict the amount of dividends and other payments the ethanol subsidiaries can transfer to their members. We are dependent on dividends from our ethanolsubsidiaries to generate cash flow. Presently our unconsolidated ethanol subsidiary has debt agreements that limit payments tomembers. Therefore, this company cannot distribute all of the cash it generates to their members. Furthermore, we may not be ableto use the excess cash flow from one subsidiary to fund corporate needs or needs of another operating ethanol subsidiary. We rely on information technology in ouroperations and financial reporting and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security breach of that technology couldharm our ability to efficiently operate our business and report our financial results accurately and timely.  We rely heavily on information technology systemsacross our operations, including for management of inventory, purchase orders, production, invoices, shipping, accounting and variousother processes and transactions. Our ability to effectively manage our business, coordinate the production, distribution and saleof our products and ensure the timely and accurate recording and disclosure of financial information depends significantly on thereliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning toupgraded or replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems through a cyber-attack or otherwise could cause delaysin product sales, reduced efficiency of our operations and delays in reporting our financial results. Significant capital investmentscould be required to remediate any such problem. Security breaches of employee information or other confidential or proprietarydata could also adversely impact our reputation, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties.16We are exposed to potential business disruptionfrom factors outside our control, including natural disasters, severe weather conditions, accidents, and unforeseen operationalfailures any of which could negatively affect our transportation operations and could adversely affect our cash flows and operatingresults. Potential business disruption in availabletransportation due to natural disasters, significant track damage resulting from a train derailment, strikes or other interruptionsby our transportation providers could result in delays in procuring and supplying raw materials to our ethanol facilities, or transportingethanol and distillers grains to our customers. Such business disruptions may result in our inability to meet customer demand orcontract delivery requirements, as well as the potential loss of customers. Rail cars used to transport ethanol mayneed to be modified or replaced to meet proposed rail safety regulations.  The leased rail cars we use to transport ethanolto market will need to be retrofitted or replaced as the Enhanced Tank Car Standards and Operation Controls for High-Hazard FlammableTrains adopted by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) calls for an enhanced tank car standard known as theDOT specification 117 and establishes a schedule to retrofit or replace older tank cars that carry crude oil and ethanol. The rulealso establishes braking standards intended to reduce the severity of accidents and new operational protocols. This could leadto increased rail car lease costs and delays in transportation of ethanol if rail cars are out of service for extended periodsof time. Risks Related to our eSteam investmentsand operations.eSteam may not be commercially viable technology. During fiscal year 2013, we invested in eSteam,a new technology utilizing steam to extract deep heavy oil. Cumulatively, we have spent approximately $1.6 million on this patentedbut unproven technology. Low energy and crude oil prices may make eSteam technology less attractive to potential users. If we cannotdemonstrate that the technology is commercially feasible, we may incur additional losses. Our eSteam technology may be subject topatent challenges.  We could be required to spend considerabletime and resources defending our technology from patent challenges. Operations utilizing our eSteam technologymay be subject to stringent environmental regulations.  These operations will require significant amountsof water and energy. If we are unable to obtain the proper permits and sources of water and energy, then we may not be able tooperate the new technologies, and thus, generate any revenue. Operations utilizing our eSteam technologymay cause environmental damage.  When operating the eSteam technology, we maycause environmental damage, as we would be injecting water into the ground in order to extract oil. We could be subject to significantpenalties and fines if we were to cause environmental damage. "
4,REX,REX AMERICAN RESOURCES CORP,2015-03-31,"Risk Factors
 We encourage you to carefully consider therisks described below and other information contained in this report when considering an investment decision in REX common stock.Any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If one or more of these events do occur, our results of operations,financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In this instance, the trading price of REX stock coulddecline, and investors might lose all or part of their investment. We have concentrations of cash depositsat financial institutions that exceed federal insurance limits. We generally have cash deposits that exceedfederal insurance limits. Should the financial institutions we deposit our cash at experience insolvency or other financial difficulty,our access to cash deposits could be limited. In extreme cases, we could lose our cash deposits entirely. This would negativelyimpact our liquidity and results of operations. The current interest rate environment hasresulted in lower yields on our excess cash. We have experienced lower yields on our excesscash compared to historical yields. Should the present economic conditions result in a sustained period of historically low interestrates, our interest income would be negatively impacted. Risks Related to our AlternativeEnergy Business The ethanol industry is changing rapidlywhich could result in unexpected developments that could negatively impact our operations. According to the RFA, the ethanol industryhas grown from approximately 1.5 billion gallons of annual ethanol production in 1999 to approximately 14.3 billion gallons ofannual ethanol production in 2014. Thus, there have been significant changes in the supply and demand of ethanol over a relativelyshort period of time which could lead to difficulty in maintaining profitable operations at our ethanol plants. If cash flow from operations of our ethanolplants is not sufficient to service debt, the plants could fail and we could lose our entire investment. The ethanol companies we are invested in haveor have had varying levels of long term debt. The ability of each company owning the plant to repay borrowings incurred will dependupon the plant’s financial and operating performance. The cash flows and capital resources of an ethanol plant may be insufficientto repay7its debt obligations. If a plant cannot service its debt, it may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sellassets, restructure its indebtedness or seek additional capital. If unable to do so, the value of our investment could declinesignificantly. The institutional senior lenders to certaincompanies which own and operate our ethanol plants hold or have had held liens on the plant’s assets. If a company failsto make its debt service payments, the senior lender will have the right to repossess the plant’s assets in addition to otherremedies, which are superior to our rights as an equity investor. Such action could have a material adverse impact on our investmentin the ethanol plant. We operate in a capital intensive industry.Limitations to external financing could adversely affect our financial performance. We may need to incur additional financing tofund growth of our business or in times of increasing liquidity requirements (such as increases in raw material costs). Any delaysin obtaining additional financing, or our inability to do so, could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. The financial returns on our ethanol investmentsare highly dependent on commodity prices, which are subject to significant volatility and uncertainty, and the availability ofsupplies, so our results could fluctuate substantially. The financial returnson our ethanol investments are highly dependent on commodity prices, especially prices for corn or other feedstock, natural gas,ethanol and unleaded gasoline. As a result of the volatility of the prices for these items, the returns may fluctuate substantiallyand our investments could experience periods of declining prices for their products and increasing costs for their raw materials,which could result in operating losses at our ethanol plants. Our returnson ethanol investments are highly sensitive to grain prices. Corn is the principal raw material our ethanol plants useto produce ethanol and co-products. As a result, changes in the price of corn can significantly affect our businesses. Rising cornprices result in higher costs of ethanol and co-products. Because ethanol competes with non-corn-based fuels, our ethanol plantsmay not be able to pass along increased grain costs to our customers. At certain levels, grain prices may make ethanol uneconomicalto produce. The price of cornis influenced by weather conditions and other factors affecting crop yields, transportation costs, farmer planting decisions, exports,the value of the U.S. dollar and general economic, market and regulatory factors. These factors include government policies andsubsidies with respect to agriculture and international trade and global and local demand and supply. The significance and relativeeffect of these factors on the price of corn is difficult to predict. Any event that tends to negatively affect the supply of corn,such as adverse weather or crop disease, could increase corn prices and potentially harm the business of our ethanol plants. Increasingdomestic ethanol capacity could boost the demand for corn and result in increased corn prices. Much of the Midwestern United Statesexperienced drought conditions during 2012 which led to a smaller harvest of corn and increased corn prices. Our ethanol plantsmay also have difficulty, from time to time, in physically sourcing corn on economical terms due to supply shortages. Such a shortagecould require our ethanol plants to suspend operations which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results ofoperations. The spread betweenethanol and corn prices can vary significantly. The gross margin at our ethanol plants depends principally on the spreadbetween ethanol and corn prices. Fluctuations in the spread are likely to continue to occur. A sustained narrow or negative spread,whether as a result of sustained high or increased8corn prices or sustained low or decreased ethanol prices, would adversely affectthe results of operations at our ethanol plants. Our risk managementstrategies may be ineffective and may expose us to decreased profitability and liquidity. In an attempt to partially offsetthe impact of volatility of commodity prices, we enter into forward contracts to sell a portion of our ethanol and distillers grainsproduction and to purchase a portion of our corn and natural gas requirements. The financial impact of these risk management activitiesis dependent upon, among other items, the prices involved and our ability to receive or deliver the commodities involved. Riskmanagement activities can result in financial loss when positions are purchased in a declining market or when positions are soldin an increasing market. We vary the amount of risk management techniques we utilize, and we may choose not to engage in any riskmanagement activities. Should we fail to properly manage the inherent volatility of commodities prices, our results of operationsand financial condition may be adversely affected. The market fornatural gas is subject to market conditions that create uncertainty in the price and availability of the natural gas that our ethanolplants use in their manufacturing process. Our ethanol plants rely upon third parties for their supply of natural gas,which is consumed as fuel in the production of ethanol. The prices for and availability of natural gas are subject to volatilemarket conditions. These market conditions often are affected by factors beyond the ethanol plants’ control, such as weatherconditions, overall economic conditions and foreign and domestic governmental regulation and relations. Significant disruptionsin the supply of natural gas could impair the ethanol plants’ ability to economically manufacture ethanol for their customers.Furthermore, increases in natural gas prices or changes in our natural gas costs relative to natural gas costs paid by competitorsmay adversely affect results of operations and financial position at our ethanol plants. Fluctuations in the selling priceof commodities may reduce profit margins at our ethanol plants. Ethanol is marketed as a fuel additive to reduce vehicleemissions from gasoline, as an octane enhancer to improve the octane rating of gasoline with which it isblended and, to a lesser extent, as a gasoline substitute. As a result, ethanol prices are influenced by the supply and demandfor gasoline and our ethanol plants’ results of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected ifgasoline demand or prices decrease. Distillers grains compete with otherprotein based animal feed products. The price of distillers grains may decrease when the prices of competing feed products decrease.The prices of competing animal feed products are based in part on the prices of the commodities from which their products are made.Historically, sales prices for distillers grains have tracked along with the price of corn. However, there have been instanceswhen the price increase for distillers grains has lagged price increases in corn prices. The production of distillers grainshas increased as a result of increases in dry mill ethanol production in the United States. This could lead to price declines inwhat we can sell our distillers grains for in the future. Such declines could have an adverse material effect on our results ofoperations. Increased ethanolproduction or decreases in demand for ethanol may result in excess production capacity in the ethanol industry, which may causethe price of ethanol, distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil to decrease. According to the RFA,domestic ethanol production nameplate capacity is approximately 15.1 billion gallons per year at January 2015. The RFA estimatesthat, as of January 2015, approximately 100 million gallons per year of additional production capacity is under construction orexpansion. The EPA proposed setting the RFS requirement to be satisfied by corn derived ethanol at 13.0 billion gallons for 2014.Excess capacity in the ethanol industry could have an adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations. In a manufacturing9industry with excess capacity, producers have an incentive to manufacture additional products for so long as the price exceedsthe marginal cost of production (i.e., the cost of producing only the next unit, without regard for interest, overhead or fixedcosts). This incentive could result in the reduction of the market price of ethanol to a level that is inadequate to generate sufficientcash flow to cover costs. Excess capacity mayalso result from decreases in the demand for ethanol, which could result from a number of factors, including, but not limited to,regulatory developments and reduced U.S. gasoline consumption. Reduced gasoline consumption could occur as a result of increasedprices for gasoline or crude oil, which could cause businesses and consumers to reduce driving or acquire vehicles with more favorablegasoline mileage or acquire hybrid vehicles. In addition, becauseethanol production produces distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil as co-products, increased ethanol production will alsolead to increased supplies of distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil. An increase in the supply of distillers grains andnon-food grade corn oil, without corresponding increases in demand, could lead to lower prices or an inability to sell our ethanolplants’ distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil production. A decline in the price of distillers grains or non-foodgrade corn oil could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations. Trade restrictions on ethanol exportscould reduce the demand for ethanol. The European Union began imposing atariff, on ethanol imported from the United States, of $83.03 per metric ton effective February 23, 2013. If producers and exportersof ethanol are subject to trade restrictions, or additional duties are imposed on exports, it may make it uneconomical to exportethanol. This could result in an oversupply of ethanol in the United States which could have a material adverse effect on the resultsof our ethanol operations. We depend on our partners to operatecertain of our ethanol investments. Our investments currently representboth majority and minority equity positions. Day-to-day operating control of minority owned plants generally remains with the localfarmers’ cooperative or investor group that has promoted the plant. We may not have the ability to directly modify the operationsof these plants in response to changes in the business environment or in response to any deficiencies in local operations of theplants. In addition, local plant operators, who also represent the primary suppliers of corn and other crops to the plants, mayhave interests, such as the price and sourcing of corn and other crops, that may differ from our interest, which is based solelyon the operating profit of the plant. The limitations on our ability to control day-to-day plant operations could adversely affectplant results of operations. We may not successfully acquire ordevelop additional ethanol investments. The growth of ourethanol business depends on our ability to identify and develop new ethanol investments. Our ethanol development strategy dependson referrals, and introductions, to new investment opportunities from industry participants, such as ethanol plant builders, financialinstitutions, marketing agents and others. We must continue to maintain favorable relationships with these industry participants,and a material disruption in these sources of referrals would adversely affect our ability to expand our ethanol investments. Any expansion strategywill depend on prevailing market conditions for the price of ethanol and the costs of corn and natural gas and the expectationsof future market conditions. There is increasing competition for suitable sites for ethanol plants. Even if suitable sites or opportunitiesare identified, we may not be able to secure the services and products from contractors, engineering firms, construction firmsand equipment suppliers necessary to build or expand ethanol plants on a timely basis or on acceptable economic terms.10Constructioncosts associated with expansion may increase to levels that would make a new plant too expensive to complete or unprofitable tooperate. Additional financing may also be necessary to implement any expansion strategy, which may not be accessible or availableon acceptable terms. New and more stringent environmental regulations could increase the operating costs of new plants, which,in turn could discourage us from further expansion. Our ethanol plantsmay be adversely affected by technological advances and efforts to anticipate and employ such technological advances may proveunsuccessful. The development and implementationof new technologies may result in a significant reduction in the costs of ethanol production. For instance, any technological advancesin the efficiency or cost to produce ethanol from inexpensive, cellulosic sources such as wheat, oat or barley straw could havean adverse effect on our ethanol plants, because those facilities are designed to produce ethanol from corn, which is, by comparison,a raw material with other high value uses. We cannot predict when new technologies may become available, the rate of acceptanceof new technologies by competitors or the costs associated with new technologies. In addition, advances in the development of alternativesto ethanol could significantly reduce demand for or eliminate the need for ethanol. Any advances in technologywhich require significant unanticipated capital expenditures to remain competitive or which reduce demand or prices for ethanolwould have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations. In addition, alternativefuels, additives and oxygenates are continually under development. Alternative fuel additives that can replace ethanol may be developed,which may decrease the demand for ethanol. It is also possible that technological advances in engine and exhaust system designand performance could reduce the use of oxygenates, which would lower the demand for ethanol, and the results of our ethanol operationsmay be materially adversely affected. The U.S. ethanol industry is highly dependentupon a myriad of federal and state legislation and regulation and any changes in legislation or regulation could materially andadversely affect our results of operations and financial position. The Energy Independence and Security Act of2007 (EISA) established RFS II, which modified the renewable fuel standard from prior legislation. EISA increased the amount ofrenewable fuel required to be blended into gasoline and required a minimum usage of corn derived renewable fuels of 12.0 billiongallons in 2010, increasing annually by 600 million gallons to 15.0 billion gallons in 2015. The EPA has the authority to assignthe mandated amounts of renewable fuels to be blended into transportation fuel to individual fuel blenders. RFS II has been a primaryfactor in the growth of ethanol usage. On April 10, 2013, the Renewable Fuel Standard Elimination Act was introduced as H.R. 1461to target the repeal of RFS II. Also introduced on April 10, 2013 was the RFS Reform Bill, H.R. 1462, which would prohibit morethan ten percent ethanol in gasoline and reduce the RFS II required volume of renewable fuel. On May 14, 2013, the Domestic AlternativesFuels Act of 2013 was introduced in the United States House of Representatives as H.R. 1959 to permit ethanol produced from naturalgas to be used to meet the RFS II mandate. These bills failed to make it out of congressional committees and were not finalizedinto law. H.R. 21 was introduced on January 6, 2015 to provide for a comprehensive assessment of the scientific and technical researchon the implication of the use of mid-level ethanol blends. This bill seeks to eliminatethe waiver granted by the EPA to allow E15 fuel in 2001 and newer model cars and trucks. H.R. 434 was introduced on January 21,2015 which seeks to modify the Clean Air Act by limiting or removing the authority of the EPA to grant waivers for higher blendsof ethanol in domestic gasoline supply. This bill also repeals existing waivers already granted by the EPA regarding E15 fuel.H.R. 704 was introduced February 4, 2015 and it is similar11to H.R. 21 as it proposes limiting ethanol blends higher than 10% indomestic fuel supply and seeks to repeal the RFS. Under EISA, the EPA has the authority to waiveor modify the mandated RFS II requirements in whole or in part. In order to grant a waiver, the EPA administrator must determinein consultation with the Secretaries of Agriculture and Energy, that one of the following two conditions has been met: i) thereis inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply or ii) implementation of the requirement would severely harm the economy or environmentof a state, region or the country. During fiscal year 2012, several waiver requests were submitted to the EPA based on droughtconditions, which were subsequently denied by the EPA. TheRFS II mandate increased to 14.4 billion gallons of corn derived renewable fuel for 2014 and increases to 15.0 billion gallonsin 2015. In November of 2013, the EPA released a proposal that included several approaches for establishing the 2014 standards.The proposal was for approximately 15.2 billion gallons, including approximately 13.0 billion gallons of corn derived renewablefuel. The proposal addresses two constraints of RFS II: i) limitations in the volume of ethanol that can be consumed in gasoline given the practical constraints on the supply of higher ethanol blendsto the vehicles that can use them and ii) limitations in the ability of the industry to produce sufficient volumes of qualifyingrenewable fuel. The EPA has never finalized the RFS for 2014 creating uncertainty for the industry. The EPA plans to offer a proposalfor RFS II for 2014, 2015 and 2016 in the spring of 2015. If the EPA reduces the mandate levels for conventional biofuels or grantsa waiver in the future, our ethanol business could be adversely affected. To document compliancewith RFS II, renewable identification numbers (“RINs”), are generated and attached to renewable fuels, and detachedwhen the renewable fuel is blended into the transportation fuel supply. Detached RINs may be retired by obligated parties to demonstratecompliance with RFS II or may be separately traded in the market. The market price of detached RINs may affect the price of ethanolin certain U.S. markets as obligated parties may factor these costs into their purchasing decisions. Moreover, at certain pricelevels for various types of RINs, it becomes more economical to import foreign sugar cane ethanol. If changes to RFS II resultin significant changes in the price of various types of RINs, it could negatively affect the price of ethanol and our ethanol business. Changes in corporate average fuel economystandards could adversely impact ethanol prices. Flexible fuel vehicles receive preferential treatment in meeting federallymandated corporate average fuel economy (“CAFE”) standards for automobiles manufactured by car makers. High blend ethanolfuels such as E-85 result in lower fuel efficiencies. Absent the CAFE preferences, car makers would not likely build flexible-fuelvehicles. Any change in CAFE preferences could reduce the growth of E-85 markets and result in lower ethanol prices. Various studies havecriticized the efficiency of ethanol, in general, and corn-based ethanol in particular, which could lead to the reduction or repealof incentives and tariffs that promote the use and domestic production of ethanol or otherwise negatively impact public perceptionand acceptance of ethanol as an alternative fuel. Although many trade groups, academics and governmentalagencies have supported ethanol as a fuel additive that promotes a cleaner environment, others have criticized ethanol productionas consuming considerably more energy and emitting more greenhouse gases than other biofuels and as potentially depleting waterresources. Other studies have suggested that corn-based ethanol is less efficient than ethanol produced from switchgrass or wheatgrain and that it negatively impacts consumers by causing prices for dairy, meat and other foodstuffs from livestock that consumecorn to increase. If these views gain acceptance, support for existing measures promoting use and domestic production of corn-basedethanol12could decline, leading to reduction or repeal of these measures. These views could also negatively impact public perceptionof the ethanol industry and acceptance of ethanol as an alternative fuel. Federal support ofcellulosic ethanol may result in reduced incentives to corn-derived ethanol producers. The American Recoveryand Reinvestment Act of 2009 and EISA provide funding opportunities in support of cellulosic ethanol obtained from biomass sourcessuch as switchgrass and poplar trees. The amended RFS mandates an increasing level of production of non-corn derived biofuels.These federal policies may suggest a long-term political preference for cellulosic processes using alternative feedstocks suchas switchgrass, silage or wood chips. Cellulosic ethanol has a smaller carbon footprint and is unlikely to divert foodstuff fromthe market. Several cellulosic ethanol plants are under development and there is a risk that cellulosic ethanol could displacecorn ethanol. Our plants are designed as single-feedstock facilities, located in corn production areas with limited alternativefeedstock nearby, and would require significant additional investment to convert to the production of cellulosic ethanol. The adoptionof cellulosic ethanol as the preferred form of ethanol could have a significant adverse effect on our ethanol business. Our ethanol business is affected by environmental and other regulationswhich could impede or prohibit our ability to successfully operate our plants. Our ethanol productionfacilities are subject to extensive air, water and other environmental regulations. We have had to obtain numerous permits to constructand operate our plants. Regulatory agencies could impose conditions or other restrictions in the permits that are detrimental orwhich increase our costs. More stringent federal or state environmental regulations could be adopted which could significantlyincrease our operating costs or require us to expend considerable resources. Our ethanol plants emitvarious airborne pollutants as by-products of the ethanol production process, including carbon dioxide. In 2007, the U.S. SupremeCourt classified carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act in a case seeking to require the EPA to regulate carbondioxide in vehicle emissions. In February 2010, the EPA released its final regulations on the Renewable Fuel Standard program.We believe our plants are grandfathered at their current operating capacity, but plant expansion will need to meet a 20% thresholdreduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from a 2005 baseline measurement to produce ethanol eligible for the RFS II mandate.To expand our plant capacity, we may be required to obtain additional permits, install advanced technology equipment, or reducedrying of certain amounts of distillers grains. We may also be required to install carbon dioxide mitigation equipment or takeother steps in order to comply with future laws or regulations. Compliance with future laws or regulations of carbon dioxide, orif we choose to expand capacity at certain of our plants, compliance with then-current regulations of carbon dioxide, could becostly and may prevent us from operating our plants as profitably, which may have a negative impact on our financial performance. The California Air ResourcesBoard (“CARB”) has adopted a Low Carbon Fuel Standard (“LCFS”) requiring a 10% reduction in GHG emissionsfrom transportation fuels by 2020. An Indirect Land Use Charge is included in this lifecycle GHG emission calculation. After aseries of rulings that temporarily prevented CARB from enforcing these regulations, the State of California Office of AdministrativeLaw approved the LCFS on November 26, 2012 and revised LCFS regulations took effect in January 2013. This standard could have anadverse impact on the market for corn-based ethanol in California if corn-based ethanol fails to achieve lifecycle GHG emissionreductions. This could have a negative impact on our financial performance.13Our ethanol businessmay become subject to various environmental and health and safety and property damage claims and liabilities. Operations of our ethanolbusiness will expose the business to the risk of environmental and health and safety claims and property damage claims, such asfailure to comply with environmental regulations. These types of claims could also be made against our ethanol business based uponthe acts or omissions of other persons. Serious claims could have a material negative impact on our results of operations, financialposition and future cash flows. Our business is notsignificantly diversified. Our financial resultsdepend heavily on our ability to operate our ethanol plants profitably. We do not have other lines of business or other sourcesof revenue to depend upon if we are unable to operate our ethanol plants profitably. Such lack of significant diversification couldhave a material negative impact on our results of operations, financial position and future cash flows should our ethanol plantsoperate unprofitably. Our revenue from thesale of distillers grains depends upon its continued market acceptance as an animal feed. Distillers grains isa co-product from the fermentation of corn to produce ethanol. Antibiotics may be used during the fermentation process to controlbacterial contamination; therefore antibiotics may be present in small quantities in distillers grains marketed as animal feed.The U. S. Food and Drug Administration’s, or FDA’s, Center for Veterinary Medicine has expressed concern about potentialanimal and human health hazards from the use of distillers grains as an animal feed due to the possibility of antibiotic residues.If the public became concerned about the impact of distillers grains in the food supply or as an acceptable animal feed, the marketfor distillers grains could be negatively impacted, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. Exports of distillersgrains produced in the United States have been increasing in recent years. The price of distillers grains has benefitted from theincreased exports of the product, with China being the largest importer. In 2013, China rejected certain shipments of distillersgrains due to the presence of unapproved genetically modified organisms. If shipments to China or other countries are rejectedor delayed, the market price for distillers grains would be negatively impacted, which would have a negative impact on our ethanolresults of operations. At certain of our plants,we extract and sell non-food grade corn oil immediately prior to the production of distillers grains. Several studies are tryingto determine how non-food grade corn oil extraction may impact the nutritional value of the resulting distillers grains. If itis determined that non-food grade corn oil extraction adversely impacts the energy content of distillers grains, the value of thedistillers grains we sell may be negatively impacted, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. The price of distillersgrains may decline as a result of restrictions or duties on distillers grains exports from the United States. Exports of distillergrains produced in the United States have been increasing in recent years. However, the export market may be jeopardized if foreigngovernments impose trade barriers or other measures to protect the foreign local markets. If producers and exporters of distillersgrains are subjected to trade barriers when selling distillers grains to foreign customers, there may be a reduction in the priceof distillers grains in the United States. Declines in the price we receive for our distillers grains could lead to decreased revenuesand may result in our inability to operate our ethanol plants profitably.14We face significantcompetition in the ethanol industry. We face significantcompetition for new ethanol investment opportunities. There are varied enterprises seeking to participate in the ethanol industry.Some enterprises provide financial and management support similar to our business model. Other enterprises seek to acquire or developplants which they will directly own and operate. Many of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources and namerecognition than we do. We must compete for investment opportunities based on our strategy of supporting and enhancing local developmentof ethanol plant opportunities. We may not be successful in competing for investment opportunities based on our strategy. The ethanol industryis primarily comprised of smaller entities that engage exclusively in ethanol production and large integrated grain companies thatproduce ethanol along with their base grain business. Several large oil companies have entered the ethanol production market. Ifthese companies increase their ethanol plant ownership or other oil companies seek to engage in direct ethanol production, therewould be less of a need to purchase ethanol from independent producers like our ethanol plants. Plants sold as partof a bankruptcy proceeding may have significantly lower fixed costs than our ethanol plants. Absent significant growth and diversification,our ethanol plants may not be able to operate profitably in a more competitive environment. No assurance can be given that ourethanol plants will be able to compete successfully or that competition from larger companies with greater financial resourceswill not have a materially adverse impact on the results of our ethanol operations. We may face competitionfrom foreign companies. There is a risk offoreign competition in the ethanol industry. Brazil is presently the second largest producer of ethanol in the world. Brazil’sethanol production is sugarcane based, and, depending on feedstock prices, may be cheaper to produce. Under the RFS, certain partieswere obligated to meet an advanced biofuel standard. In recent years, sugarcane based ethanol imported from Brazil has been oneof the most economical means for obligated parties to comply with this standard. If significant additionalforeign ethanol production capacity is created, such facilities could create excess supplies of ethanol, which may result in lowerprices of ethanol. In addition, foreign ethanol producers may be able to produce ethanol at costs lower than ours. These riskscould have significant adverse effects on our financial performance. In addition, the tariffthat protected the U.S. ethanol industry expired at the end of 2011. The expiration of the tariff could lead to increases in theimport of ethanol produced outside of the U.S. We are exposedto credit risk from our sales of ethanol and distillers grains to customers. The inability of acustomer to make payments to us for our accounts receivable may cause us to experience losses and may adversely impact our liquidityand our ability to make our payments when due. We may not be ableto hire and retain qualified personnel to operate our ethanol plants. Our ability to attractand retain competent personnel has a significant impact on operating efficiencies and plant profitability. Competition for keyplant employees in the ethanol industry can be intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees. Failureto do so could have a negative impact on our financial results at individual plants.15Our plants depend on an uninterrupted supply of energy and waterto operate. Unforeseen plant shutdowns could harm our business. Our plants require a significant and uninterruptedsupply of natural gas, electricity and water to operate. We generally rely on third parties to provide these resources. If thereis an interruption in the supply of energy or water for any reason, such as supply, delivery or mechanical problems and we areunable to secure an adequate alternative supply to sustain plant operations, we may be required to stop production. A productionhalt for an extended period of time could result in material losses. Potential business disruption from factorsoutside our control, including natural disasters, severe weather conditions, accidents, strikes, unexpected equipment failuresand unforeseen plant shutdowns, could adversely affect our cash flow and operating results. Certain of the debt agreements for the ethanolplants contain restrictive financial and performance covenants. Our subsidiaries that operate ethanol plants(“ethanol subsidiaries”) have or have had debt agreements that contain covenants with several financial and performancerestrictions. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the applicable agreement. If a default were tooccur, the ethanol subsidiary would likely seek a waiver of that default, attempt to reset the covenant, or refinance the instrumentand accompanying obligations. If the ethanol subsidiary was unable to obtain this relief, the default could result in the accelerationof the total due related to that debt obligation. If a default were to occur, the ethanol subsidiary may not be able to pay itsdebts or borrow sufficient funds to refinance them. In addition, certain lease agreements could also be in default if a defaultof the debt agreement occurs. In the past, we have received waivers fromour lenders for failure to meet certain financial covenants and have amended our subsidiary loan agreements to change these covenants.No assurance can be given that, if we are unable to comply with these covenants in the future, we will be able to obtain the necessarywaivers or amend our subsidiary loan agreements to prevent a default. Any of these events, if they occur, could materiallyadversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The debt agreements for certain of the ethanolplants limit, or otherwise restrict the amount of dividends and other payments the ethanol subsidiaries can transfer to their members. We are dependent on dividends from our ethanolsubsidiaries to generate cash flow. Presently our unconsolidated ethanol subsidiaries have debt agreements that limit paymentsto members. Therefore, these companies cannot distribute all of the cash they generate to their members. Furthermore, we may notbe able to use the excess cash flow from one subsidiary to fund corporate needs or needs of another operating ethanol subsidiary. We rely on information technology in ouroperations and financial reporting and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security breach of that technology couldharm our ability to efficiently operate our business and report our financial results accurately and timely. We rely heavily on information technology systemsacross our operations, including for management of inventory, purchase orders, production, invoices, shipping, accounting and variousother processes and transactions. Our ability to effectively manage our business, coordinate the production, distribution and saleof our products and ensure the timely and accurate recording and disclosure of financial information depends significantly on thereliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate16effectively, problems with transitioning toupgraded or replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems through a cyber-attack or otherwise could cause delaysin product sales, reduced efficiency of our operations and delays in reporting our financial results. Significant capital investmentscould be required to remediate any such problem. Security breaches of employee information or other confidential or proprietarydata could also adversely impact our reputation, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. We are exposed to potential business disruptionfrom factors outside our control, including natural disasters, severe weather conditions, accidents, and unforeseen operationalfailures any of which could negatively affect our transportation operations and could adversely affect our cash flows and operatingresults. Potential business disruption in availabletransportation due to natural disasters, significant track damage resulting from a train derailment, strikes or other interruptionsby our transportation providers could result in delays in procuring and supplying raw materials to our ethanol facilities, or transportingethanol and distillers grains to our customers. Such business disruptions may result in our inability to meet customer demand orcontract delivery requirements, as well as the potential loss of customers. Rail cars used to transport ethanol mayneed to be modified or replaced to meet proposed rail safety regulations. The leased rail cars we use to transport ethanolto market may need to be retrofitted or replaced if proposed regulations are adopted. The proposed regulations call for a phaseout within four years of the use of legacy tank cars for transporting ethanol. Adoption of the proposed regulations, which couldresult in upgrades or replacements of our leased rail cars, would likely have an adverse effect on our operations as rail car leasecosts would likely increase. Furthermore, existing rail cars could be out of service for extended periods of time as upgrades aremade, which could cause transportation delays of ethanol. Risks Related to our eSteam investmentsand operations.eSteam may not be commercially viable technology. During fiscal year 2013, we invested in eSteam,a new technology utilizing steam to extract deep heavy oil. Cumulatively, we have spent approximately $1.4 million on this patentedbut unproven technology. If we cannot demonstrate that the technology is commercially feasible, we may incur additional losses. Our eSteam technology may be subject topatent challenges. We could be required to spend considerabletime and resources defending our technology from patent challenges. Operations utilizing our eSteam technologymay be subject to stringent environmental regulations. These operations will require significant amountsof water and energy. If we are unable to obtain the proper permits and sources of water and energy, then we may not be able tooperate the new technologies, and thus, generate any revenue. Operations utilizing our eSteam technologymay cause environmental damage. When operating the eSteam technology, we maycause environmental damage, as we would be injecting water into the ground in order to extract oil. We could be subject to significantpenalties and fines if we were to cause environmental damage.17"
6,REX,REX AMERICAN RESOURCES CORP,2014-04-09,"Risk Factors
 We encourage you to carefully considerthe risks described below and other information contained in this report when considering an investment decision in REX commonstock. Any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If one or more of these events do occur, our results ofoperations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In this instance, the trading price of REXstock could decline, and investors might lose all or part of their investment. We have concentrations of cash depositsat financial institutions that exceed federal insurance limits. We generally have cash deposits that exceedfederal insurance limits. Should the financial institutions we deposit our cash at experience insolvency or other financial difficulty,our access to cash deposits could be limited. In extreme cases, we could lose our cash deposits entirely. This would negativelyimpact our liquidity and results of operations. The current interest rate environmenthas resulted in lower yields on our excess cash. We have experienced lower yields on ourexcess cash compared to historical yields. Should the present economic conditions result in a sustained period of historicallylow interest rates, our interest income would be negatively impacted.8Risks Related to our Income Tax Benefits We may not be able to generate sufficient taxable incometo realize our deferred tax assets. We have approximately $19.8 million ofalternative minimum tax (“AMT”) credit carryforwards recorded as deferred tax assets on our consolidated financialstatements. Should future results of operations or other factors cause us to determine that it is not more likely than not thatwe will generate sufficient taxable income to fully utilize our deferred tax assets, we would then be required to establish a valuationallowance against such deferred tax assets. We would increase our income tax expense by the amount of the tax benefit we do notexpect to realize. This would negatively impact our net income (loss) and could have a material adverse effect on our results ofoperations and our financial position. Risks Related to our Alternative EnergyBusiness The ethanol industry is changing rapidlywhich could result in unexpected developments that could negatively impact our operations. According to the RFA, the ethanol industryhas grown from approximately 1.5 billion gallons of annual ethanol production in 1999 to approximately 13.3 billion gallons ofannual ethanol production in 2013. Thus, there have been significant changes in the supply and demand of ethanol over a relativelyshort period of time which could lead to difficulty in maintaining profitable operations at our ethanol plants. If cash flow from operations of ourethanol plants is not sufficient to service debt, the plants could fail and we could lose our entire investment. The ethanol companies we have investedin have varying levels of long term debt. The ability of each company owning the plant to repay borrowings incurred will dependupon the plant’s financial and operating performance. The cash flows and capital resources of an ethanol plant may be insufficientto repay its debt obligations. If a plant cannot service its debt, it may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sellassets, restructure its indebtedness or seek additional capital. If unable to do so, the value of our investment could declinesignificantly. The institutional senior lenders to thecompanies which own and operate our ethanol plants hold liens on the plant’s assets. If a company fails to make its debtservice payments, the senior lender will have the right to repossess the plant’s assets in addition to other remedies, whichare superior to our rights as an equity investor. Such action could have a material adverse impact on our investment in the ethanolplant. We operate in a capital intensive industry.Limitations to external financing could adversely affect our financial performance. We may need to incur additional financingto fund growth of our business or in times of increasing liquidity requirements (such as increases in raw material costs). Anydelays to obtain additional financing, or our inability to do so, could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. The financial returns on our ethanolinvestments are highly dependent on commodity prices, which are subject to significant volatility and uncertainty, and the availabilityof supplies, so our results could fluctuate substantially. The financial returnson our ethanol investments are highly dependent on commodity prices, especially prices for corn or other feedstock, natural gas,ethanol and unleaded gasoline. As a result of the volatility of9the prices for theseitems, the returns may fluctuate substantially and our investments could experience periods of declining prices for their productsand increasing costs for their raw materials, which could result in operating losses at our ethanol plants. Our returns onethanol investments are highly sensitive to grain prices. Corn is the principal raw material our ethanol plants use toproduce ethanol and co-products. As a result, changes in the price of corn can significantly affect their businesses. Rising cornprices result in higher costs of ethanol and co-products. Because ethanol competes with non-corn-based fuels, our ethanol plantsmay not be able to pass along increased grain costs to their customers. At certain levels, grain prices may make ethanol uneconomicalto produce. The price of corn isinfluenced by weather conditions and other factors affecting crop yields, transportation costs, farmer planting decisions, exports,the value of the U.S. dollar and general economic, market and regulatory factors. These factors include government policies andsubsidies with respect to agriculture and international trade and global and local demand and supply. The significance and relativeeffect of these factors on the price of corn is difficult to predict. Any event that tends to negatively affect the supply of corn,such as adverse weather or crop disease, could increase corn prices and potentially harm the business of our ethanol plants. Increasingdomestic ethanol capacity could boost the demand for corn and result in increased corn prices. Much of the Midwestern United Statesexperienced drought conditions during 2012 which led to a smaller harvest of corn and increased corn prices. Our ethanol plantsmay also have difficulty, from time to time, in physically sourcing corn on economical terms due to supply shortages. Such a shortagecould require our ethanol plants to suspend operations which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results ofoperations. The spread betweenethanol and corn prices can vary significantly. The gross margin at our ethanol plants depends principally on the spreadbetween ethanol and corn prices. Fluctuations in the spread are likely to continue to occur. A sustained narrow or negative spread,whether as a result of sustained high or increased corn prices or sustained low or decreased ethanol prices, would adversely affectthe results of operations at our ethanol plants. Our risk managementstrategies may be ineffective and may expose us to decreased profitability and liquidity. In an attempt to partially offsetthe impact of volatility of commodity prices, we enter into forward contracts to sell a portion of our ethanol and distillers grainsproduction and to purchase a portion of our corn and natural gas requirements. The financial impact of these risk management activitiesis dependent upon, among other items, the prices involved and our ability to receive or deliver the commodities involved. Riskmanagement activities can result in financial loss when positions are purchased in a declining market or when positions are soldin an increasing market. We vary the amount of risk management techniques we utilize, and we may choose not to engage in any riskmanagement activities. Should we fail to properly manage the inherent volatility of commodities prices, our results of operationsand financial condition may be adversely affected. The market fornatural gas is subject to market conditions that create uncertainty in the price and availability of the natural gas that our ethanolplants use in their manufacturing process. Our ethanol plants rely upon third parties for their supply of natural gas,which is consumed as fuel in the production of ethanol. The prices for and availability of natural gas are subject to volatilemarket conditions. These market conditions often are affected by factors beyond the ethanol plants’ control, such as weatherconditions, overall economic conditions and foreign and domestic governmental regulation and relations. Significant disruptionsin the supply of natural gas could impair the ethanol plants’ ability to economically manufacture ethanol for their customers.Furthermore, increases in natural gas prices or changes in our10natural gas costs relativeto natural gas costs paid by competitors may adversely affect results of operations and financial position at our ethanol plants. Fluctuations in the selling priceof commodities may reduce profit margins at our ethanol plants. Ethanol is marketed as a fuel additive to reduce vehicleemissions from gasoline, as an octane enhancer to improve the octane rating of gasoline with which it is blended and, to a lesserextent, as a gasoline substitute. As a result, ethanol prices are influenced by the supply and demand for gasoline and our ethanolplants’ results of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected if gasoline demand decreases. Distillers grains compete with other proteinbased animal feed products. The price of distillers grains may decrease when the prices of competing feed products decrease. Theprices of competing animal feed products are based in part on the prices of the commodities from which their products are made.Historically, sales prices for distillers grains have tracked along with the price of corn. However, there have been instanceswhen the price increase for distillers grains has lagged price increases in corn prices. The production of distillers grains hasincreased as a result of increases in dry mill ethanol production in the United States. This could lead to price declines in whatwe can sell our distillers grains for in the future. Such declines could have an adverse material effect on our results of operations. Increased ethanolproduction or decreases in demand for ethanol may result in excess production capacity in the ethanol industry, which may causethe price of ethanol, distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil to decrease. According to the RFA,domestic ethanol production nameplate capacity is approximately 14.9 billion gallons per year at January 2014. The RFA estimatesthat, as of January 2014, approximately 167 million gallons per year of additional production capacity is under construction orexpansion. Current ethanol production capacity exceeds the proposed 2014 RFS requirement which can be satisfied by corn based ethanol(13.0 billion gallons). Excess capacity in the ethanol industry could have an adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations.In a manufacturing industry with excess capacity, producers have an incentive to manufacture additional products for so long asthe price exceeds the marginal cost of production (i.e., the cost of producing only the next unit, without regard for interest,overhead or fixed costs). This incentive could result in the reduction of the market price of ethanol to a level that is inadequateto generate sufficient cash flow to cover costs. Excess capacity may alsoresult from decreases in the demand for ethanol, which could result from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, regulatorydevelopments and reduced U.S. gasoline consumption. Reduced gasoline consumption could occur as a result of increased prices forgasoline or crude oil, which could cause businesses and consumers to reduce driving or acquire vehicles with more favorable gasolinemileage or acquire hybrid vehicles. In addition, becauseethanol production produces distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil as co-products, increased ethanol production will alsolead to increased supplies of distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil. An increase in the supply of distillers grains andnon-food grade corn oil, without corresponding increases in demand, could lead to lower prices or an inability to sell our ethanolplants’ distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil production. A decline in the price of distillers grains or non-foodgrade corn oil could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations. Trade restrictions on ethanol exportscould reduce the demand for ethanol.11The European Union began imposing a tariff,on ethanol imported from the United States, of $83.03 per metric ton effective February 23, 2013. If producers and exporters ofethanol are subject to trade restrictions, or additional duties are imposed on exports, it may make it uneconomical to export ethanol.This could result in an oversupply of ethanol in the United States which could have a material adverse effect on the results ofour ethanol operations. We depend on our partners to operatecertain of our ethanol investments. Our investments currently represent bothmajority and minority equity positions. Day-to-day operating control of minority owned plants generally remains with the localfarmers’ cooperative or investor group that has promoted the plant. We may not have the ability to directly modify the operationsof these plants in response to changes in the business environment or in response to any deficiencies in local operations of theplants. In addition, local plant operators, who also represent the primary suppliers of corn and other crops to the plants, mayhave interests, such as the price and sourcing of corn and other crops, that may differ from our interest, which is based solelyon the operating profit of the plant. The limitations on our ability to control day-to-day plant operations could adversely affectplant results of operations. We may not successfully acquire or developadditional ethanol investments. The growth of our ethanolbusiness depends on our ability to identify and develop new ethanol investments. Our ethanol development strategy depends on referrals,and introductions, to new investment opportunities from industry participants, such as ethanol plant builders, financial institutions,marketing agents and others. We must continue to maintain favorable relationships with these industry participants, and a materialdisruption in these sources of referrals would adversely affect our ability to expand our ethanol investments. Any expansion strategywill depend on prevailing market conditions for the price of ethanol and the costs of corn and natural gas and the expectationsof future market conditions. There is increasing competition for suitable sites for ethanol plants. Even if suitable sites or opportunitiesare identified, we may not be able to secure the services and products from contractors, engineering firms, construction firmsand equipment suppliers necessary to build or expand ethanol plants on a timely basis or on acceptable economic terms. Constructioncosts associated with expansion may increase to levels that would make a new plant too expensive to complete or unprofitable tooperate. Additional financing may also be necessary to implement any expansion strategy, which may not be accessible or availableon acceptable terms. Our ethanol plants may be adverselyaffected by technological advances and efforts to anticipate and employ such technological advances may prove unsuccessful. The development and implementation of newtechnologies may result in a significant reduction in the costs of ethanol production. For instance, any technological advancesin the efficiency or cost to produce ethanol from inexpensive, cellulosic sources such as wheat, oat or barley straw could havean adverse effect on our ethanol plants, because those facilities are designed to produce ethanol from corn, which is, by comparison,a raw material with other high value uses. We cannot predict when new technologies may become available, the rate of acceptanceof new technologies by competitors or the costs associated with new technologies. In addition, advances in the development of alternativesto ethanol could significantly reduce demand for or eliminate the need for ethanol. Any advances in technology which requiresignificant unanticipated capital expenditures to remain competitive or which reduce demand or prices for ethanol would have amaterial adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations.12In addition, alternative fuels, additivesand oxygenates are continually under development. Alternative fuel additives that can replace ethanol may be developed, which maydecrease the demand for ethanol. It is also possible that technological advances in engine and exhaust system design and performancecould reduce the use of oxygenates, which would lower the demand for ethanol, and the results of our ethanol operations may bematerially adversely affected. The U.S. ethanol industry is highlydependent upon a myriad of federal and state legislation and regulation and any changes in legislation or regulation could materiallyand adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. The Energy Independence and Security Actof 2007 (EISA) established RFS II, which modified the renewable fuel standard from prior legislation. EISA increased the amountof renewable fuel required to be blended into gasoline and required a minimum usage of corn derived renewable fuels of 12.0 billiongallons in 2010, increasing annually by 600 million gallons to 15.0 billion gallons in 2015. The EPA has the authority to assignthe mandated amounts of renewable fuels to be blended into transportation fuel to individual fuel blenders. RFS II has been a primaryfactor in the growth of ethanol usage. On April 10, 2013, the Renewable Fuel Standard Elimination Act was introduced as H.R 1461to target the repeal of RFS II. Also introduced on April 10, 2013 was the RFS Reform Bill, H.R. 1462, which would prohibit morethan ten percent ethanol in gasoline and reduce the RFS II required volume of renewable fuel. On May 14, 2013, the Domestic AlternativesFuels Act of 2013 was introduced in the United States House of Representatives as H.R. 1959 to permit ethanol produced from naturalgas to be used to meet the RFS II mandate. All of these bills were assigned to congressional committees, which will consider thembefore sending any legislation to Congress. Under EISA, the EPA has the authority towaive the mandated RFS II requirements in whole or in part. In order to grant a waiver, the EPA administrator must determine inconsultation with the Secretaries of Agriculture and Energy, that one of the following two conditions has been met: i) there isinadequate domestic renewable fuel supply or ii) implementation of the requirement would severely harm the economy or environmentof a state, region or the country. During fiscal year 2013, several waiver requests were submitted to the EPA based on droughtconditions, which were subsequently denied by the EPA. The RFS II mandate increased to 14.4 billiongallons of corn derived renewable fuel for 2014 and increases to 15.0 billion gallons in 2015. In November of 2013, the EPA releaseda proposal that includes several approaches for establishing the 2014 standards. The proposal seeks comment on a range of totalrenewable fuel volumes for 2014 and proposes a level within that range of 15.2 billion gallons, including approximately 13.0 billiongallons of corn derived renewable fuel. The proposal addresses two constraints of RFS II: i) limitations in the volume of ethanolthat can be consumed in gasoline given the practical constraints on the supply of higher ethanol blends to the vehicles that canuse them and ii) limitations in the ability of the industry to produce sufficient volumes of qualifying renewable fuel. If theEPA reduces the 2014 mandate levels for conventional biofuels or grants a waiver in the future, our ethanol business could be adverselyaffected. To document compliance with RFS II, renewableidentification numbers (“RINs”), are generated and attached to renewable fuels, and detached when the renewable fuelis blended into the transportation fuel supply. Detached RINs may be retired by obligated parties to demonstrate compliance withRFS II or may be separately traded in the market. The market price of detached RINs may affect the price of ethanol in certainU.S. markets as obligated parties may factor these costs into their purchasing decisions. Moreover, at certain price levels forvarious types of RINs, it becomes more economical to import foreign sugar cane ethanol. If changes to RFS II result in significantchanges in the price of various types of RINs, it could negatively affect the price of ethanol and our ethanol business.13Changes in corporate average fueleconomy standards could adversely impact ethanol prices. Flexible fuel vehicles receive preferential treatment in meetingfederally mandated corporate average fuel economy (“CAFE”) standards for automobiles manufactured by car makers. Highblend ethanol fuels such as E-85 result in lower fuel efficiencies. Absent the CAFE preferences, car makers would not likely buildflexible-fuel vehicles. Any change in CAFE preferences could reduce the growth of E-85 markets and result in lower ethanol prices. Various studies have criticized theefficiency of ethanol, in general, and corn-based ethanol in particular, which could lead to the reduction or repeal of incentivesand tariffs that promote the use and domestic production of ethanol or otherwise negatively impact public perception and acceptanceof ethanol as an alternative fuel. Although many trade groups, academics andgovernmental agencies have supported ethanol as a fuel additive that promotes a cleaner environment, others have criticized ethanolproduction as consuming considerably more energy and emitting more greenhouse gases than other biofuels and as potentially depletingwater resources. Other studies have suggested that corn-based ethanol is less efficient than ethanol produced from switchgrassor wheat grain and that it negatively impacts consumers by causing prices for dairy, meat and other foodstuffs from livestock thatconsume corn to increase. If these views gain acceptance, support for existing measures promoting use and domestic production ofcorn-based ethanol could decline, leading to reduction or repeal of these measures. These views could also negatively impact publicperception of the ethanol industry and acceptance of ethanol as an alternative fuel. Federal support of cellulosic ethanolmay result in reduced incentives to corn-derived ethanol producers. The American Recovery and ReinvestmentAct of 2009 and EISA provide funding opportunities in support of cellulosic ethanol obtained from biomass sources such as switchgrassand poplar trees. The amended RFS mandates an increasing level of production of non-corn derived biofuels. These federal policiesmay suggest a long-term political preference for cellulosic processes using alternative feedstocks such as switchgrass, silageor wood chips. Cellulosic ethanol has a smaller carbon footprint and is unlikely to divert foodstuff from the market. Several cellulosicethanol plants are under development and there is a risk that cellulosic ethanol could displace corn ethanol. Our plants are designedas single-feedstock facilities, located in corn production areas with limited alternative feedstock nearby, and would require significantadditional investment to convert to the production of cellulosic ethanol. The adoption of cellulosic ethanol as the preferred formof ethanol could have a significant adverse effect on our ethanol business. Our ethanol business is affected by environmental and otherregulations which could impede or prohibit our ability to successfully operate our plants. Our ethanol production facilities are subjectto extensive air, water and other environmental regulations. We have had to obtain numerous permits to construct and operate ourplants. Regulatory agencies could impose conditions or other restrictions in the permits that are detrimental or which increaseour costs. More stringent federal or state environmental regulations could be adopted which could significantly increase our operatingcosts or require us to expend considerable resources. Our ethanol plants emit various airbornepollutants as by-products of the ethanol production process, including carbon dioxide. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court classifiedcarbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act in a case seeking to require the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide in vehicleemissions. In February 2010, the EPA released its final regulations on the Renewable Fuel Standard program. We believe our plantsare grandfathered at their current operating capacity, but plant expansion will need to meet14a 20% threshold reduction in greenhousegas (GHG) emissions from a 2005 baseline measurement to produce ethanol eligible for the RFSII mandate. To expand our plant capacity,we may be required to obtain additional permits, install advanced technology equipment, or reduce drying of certain amounts ofdistillers grains. We may also be required to install carbon dioxide mitigation equipment or take other steps in order to complywith future laws or regulations. Compliance with future laws or regulations of carbon dioxide, or if we choose to expand capacityat certain of our plants, compliance with then-current regulations of carbon dioxide, could be costly and may prevent us from operatingour plants as profitably, which may have a negative impact on our financial performance. The California Air Resources Board (“CARB”)has adopted a Low Carbon Fuel Standard (“LCFS”) requiring a 10% reduction in GHG emissions from transportation fuelsby 2020. An Indirect Land Use Charge is included in this lifecycle GHG emission calculation. After a series of rulings that temporarilyprevented CARB from enforcing these regulations, the State of California Office of Administrative Law approved the LCFS on November26, 2012 and revised LCFS regulations took effect in January 2013. This standard could have an adverse impact on the market forcorn-based ethanol in California if corn-based ethanol fails to achieve lifecycle GHG emission reductions. This could have a negativeimpact on our financial performance. Our ethanol business may become subjectto various environmental and health and safety and property damage claims and liabilities. Operations of our ethanol business willexpose the business to the risk of environmental and health and safety claims and property damage claims, such as failure to complywith environmental regulations. These types of claims could also be made against our ethanol business based upon the acts or omissionsof other persons. Serious claims could have a material negative impact on our results of operations, financial position and futurecash flows. Our business is not significantly diversified. Our financial results depend heavily onour ability to operate our ethanol plants profitably. We do not have significant other lines of business or other sources of revenueto depend upon if we are unable to operate our ethanol plants profitably. Such lack of significant diversification could have amaterial negative impact on our results of operations, financial position and future cash flows should our ethanol plants operateunprofitably. Our revenue from the sale of distillersgrains depends upon its continued market acceptance as an animal feed. Distillers grains is a co-product fromthe fermentation of corn to produce ethanol. Antibiotics may be used during the fermentation process to control bacterial contamination;therefore antibiotics may be present in small quantities in distillers grains marketed as animal feed. The U. S. Food and DrugAdministration’s, or FDA’s, Center for Veterinary Medicine has expressed concern about potential animal and human healthhazards from the use of distillers grains as an animal feed due to the possibility of antibiotic residues. If the public becameconcerned about the impact of distillers grains in the food supply or as an acceptable animal feed, the market for distillers grainscould be negatively impacted, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. Exports of distillers grains produced inthe United States have been increasing in recent years. The price of distillers grains has benefitted from the increased exportsof the product, with China being the largest importer. In 2013, China rejected certain shipments of distillers grains due to thepresence of unapproved15genetically modified organisms. If shipmentsto China or other countries are rejected or delayed, the market price for distillers grains would be negatively impacted, whichwould have a negative impact on our ethanol results of operations. At certain of our plants, we extract andsell non-food grade corn oil immediately prior to the production of distillers grains. Several studies are trying to determinehow non-food grade corn oil extraction may impact the nutritional value of the resulting distillers grains. If it is determinedthat non-food grade corn oil extraction adversely impacts the energy content of distillers grains, the value of the distillersgrains we sell may be negatively impacted, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. The price of distillers grains may declineas a result of restrictions or duties on distillers grains exports from the United States. Exports of distiller grains produced inthe United States have been increasing in recent years. However, the export market may be jeopardized if foreign governments imposetrade barriers or other measures to protect the foreign local markets. If producers and exporters of distillers grains are subjectedto trade barriers when selling distillers grains to foreign customers, there may be a reduction in the price of distillers grainsin the United States. Declines in the price we receive for our distillers grains could lead to decreased revenues and may resultin our inability to operate our ethanol plants profitably. We face significantcompetition in the ethanol industry. We face significant competitionfor new ethanol investment opportunities. There are varied enterprises seeking to participate in the ethanol industry. Some enterprisesprovide financial and management support similar to our business model. Other enterprises seek to acquire or develop plants whichthey will directly own and operate. Many of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources and name recognitionthan we do. We must compete for investment opportunities based on our strategy of supporting and enhancing local development ofethanol plant opportunities. We may not be successful in competing for investment opportunities based on our strategy. The ethanol industryis primarily comprised of smaller entities that engage exclusively in ethanol production and large integrated grain companies thatproduce ethanol along with their base grain business. Several large oil companies have entered the ethanol production market. Ifthese companies increase their ethanol plant ownership or other oil companies seek to engage in direct ethanol production, therewould be less of a need to purchase ethanol from independent producers like our ethanol plants. Larger firms offer efficienciesand economies of scale, resulting in lower costs of production. In addition, plants sold as part of a bankruptcy proceeding mayhave significantly lower fixed costs than our ethanol plants. Absent significant growth and diversification, our ethanol plantsmay not be able to operate profitably in a more competitive environment. No assurance can be given that our ethanol plants willbe able to compete successfully or that competition from larger companies with greater financial resources will not have a materiallyadverse impact on the results of our ethanol operations. We may face competitionfrom foreign companies. There is a risk of foreigncompetition in the ethanol industry. Brazil is presently the second largest producer of ethanol in the world. Brazil’s ethanolproduction is sugarcane based, and, depending on feedstock prices, may be cheaper to produce. Under the RFS, certain parties wereobligated to meet an advanced biofuel standard. In recent years, sugarcane based ethanol imported from Brazil has been one of themost economical means for obligated parties to comply with this standard.16If significant additionalforeign ethanol production capacity is created, such facilities could create excess supplies of ethanol, which may result in lowerprices of ethanol. In addition, foreign ethanol producers may be able to produce ethanol at costs lower than ours. These riskscould have significant adverse effects on our financial performance. In addition, the tariffthat protected the U.S. ethanol industry expired at the end of 2011. The expiration of the tariff could lead to increases in theimport of ethanol produced outside of the U.S. We are exposed tocredit risk from our sales of ethanol and distillers grains to customers. The inability of a customerto make payments to us for our accounts receivable may cause us to experience losses and may adversely impact our liquidity andour ability to make our payments when due. We may not be ableto hire and retain qualified personnel to operate our ethanol plants. Our ability to attractand retain competent personnel has a significant impact on operating efficiencies and plant profitability. Competition for keyplant employees in the ethanol industry can be intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees. Failureto do so could have a negative impact on our financial results at individual plants. Our plants depend on an uninterrupted supply of energy andwater to operate. Unforeseen plant shutdowns could harm our business. Our plants require a significant and uninterruptedsupply of natural gas, electricity and water to operate. We generally rely on third parties to provide these resources. If thereis an interruption in the supply of energy or water for any reason, such as supply, delivery or mechanical problems and we areunable to secure an adequate alternative supply to sustain plant operations, we may be required to stop production. A productionhalt for an extended period of time could result in material losses. Potential business disruption from factorsoutside our control, including natural disasters, severe weather conditions, accidents, strikes, unexpected equipment failuresand unforeseen plant shutdowns, could adversely affect our cash flow and operating results. The debt agreements for the ethanolplants contain restrictive financial and performance covenants. Our subsidiaries that operate ethanol plants(“ethanol subsidiaries”) have debt agreements that contain covenants with several financial and performance restrictions.A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the applicable agreement. If a default were to occur, the ethanolsubsidiary would likely seek a waiver of that default, attempt to reset the covenant, or refinance the instrument and accompanyingobligations. If the ethanol subsidiary was unable to obtain this relief, the default could result in the acceleration of the totaldue related to that debt obligation. If a default were to occur, the ethanol subsidiary may not be able to pay its debts or borrowsufficient funds to refinance them. In addition, certain lease agreements could also be in default if a default of the debt agreementoccurs. In the past, we have received waivers fromour lenders for failure to meet certain financial covenants and have amended our subsidiary loan agreements to change these covenants.No assurance can be given that, if we are unable to comply with these covenants in the future, we will be able to obtain the necessarywaivers or amend our subsidiary loan agreements to prevent a default.17Any of these events, if they occur, couldmaterially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The debt agreements for the ethanolplants limit, or otherwise restrict the amount of dividends and other payments the ethanol subsidiaries can transfer to their members. We are dependent on dividends from ourethanol subsidiaries to generate cash flow. Presently, all of our ethanol subsidiaries have debt agreements that limit paymentsto members. Therefore, these companies cannot distribute all of the cash they generate to their members. Furthermore, we may notbe able to use the excess cash flow from one subsidiary to fund corporate needs or needs of another operating ethanol subsidiary. We rely on information technology inour operations and financial reporting and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security breach of that technologycould harm our ability to efficiently operate our business and report our financial results accurately and timely. We rely heavily on information technologysystems across our operations, including for management of inventory, purchase orders, production, invoices, shipping, accountingand various other processes and transactions. Our ability to effectively manage our business, coordinate the production, distributionand sale of our products and ensure the timely and accurate recording and disclosure of financial information depends significantlyon the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioningto upgraded or replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems through a cyber-attack or otherwise could cause delaysin product sales, reduced efficiency of our operations and delays in reporting our financial results. Significant capital investmentscould be required to remediate any such problem. Security breaches of employee information or other confidential or proprietarydata could also adversely impact our reputation, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. We are exposed to potential businessdisruption from factors outside our control, including natural disasters, severe weather conditions, accidents, and unforeseenoperational failures any of which could negatively affect our transportation operations and could adversely affect our cash flowsand operating results. Potential business disruption inavailable transportation due to natural disasters, significant track damage resulting from a train derailment, strikesor other interruptions by our transportation providers could result in delays in procuring and supplying raw materials to ourethanol facilities, or transporting ethanol and distillers grains to our customers. Such business disruptions may result inour inability to meet customer demand or contract delivery requirements, as well as the potential loss of customers. Risks Related to the Exit of our Retailbusiness and Risks Related to our Real Estate Segment. We have vacant retail space after the completion of the winddown of our retail business. At January 31, 2014, we own seven formerretail store properties comprising approximately 86,000 square feet of vacant real estate. We are currently marketing these facilitiesfor lease or sale. In addition, we have four former retail store locations with leases in place to tenants. We may not be ableto successfully lease or sell these properties which could result in lost opportunities for revenue or future impairment chargesrelated to the carrying value of the associated assets. We also have costs related to the vacant properties such as property taxesand utilities that we would have to bear without any revenue from such properties. Risks Related to our eSteam investmentsand operations.18eSteam may not be commercially viabletechnology. During fiscal year 2013, we invested ineSteam, a new technology utilizing steam to extract deep heavy oil. We spent approximately $1.0 million on this technology duringfiscal year 2013. eSteam is a patented but unproven technology. If we cannot demonstrate that the technology is commercially feasible,we may incur additional losses. Our eSteam technology may be subjectto patent challenges. We could be required to spend considerabletime and resources defending our technology from patent challenges. Operations utilizing our eSteam technologymay be subject to stringent environmental regulations. These operations will require significantamounts of water and energy. If we are unable to obtain the proper permits and sources of water and energy, then we may not beable to operate the new technologies, and thus, generate any revenue. "
15,REX,REX AMERICAN RESOURCES CORP,2013-04-09,"Risk Factors
 We encourage you to carefully considerthe risks described below and other information contained in this report when considering an investment decision in REX commonstock. Any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If one or more of these events do occur, our results ofoperations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In this instance, the trading price of REXstock could decline, and investors might lose all or part of their investment. We have concentrations of cash depositsat financial institutions that exceed federal insurance limits. We generally have cash deposits that exceedfederal insurance limits. Should the financial institutions we deposit our cash at experience insolvency or other financial difficulty,our access to cash deposits could be limited. In extreme cases, we could lose our cash deposits entirely. This would negativelyimpact our liquidity and results of operations. The current interest rate environmenthas resulted in lower yields on our excess cash. We have experienced lower yields on ourexcess cash compared to historical yields. Should the present economic conditions result in a sustained period of historicallylow interest rates, our interest income would be negatively impacted. Risks Related to our Synthetic Fuel Investments andIncome Tax Benefits We face synthetic fuel risks as future IRS audits may result in the disallowance of previously recognizedtax credits. We have recognized investment income ofapproximately $4.7 million from the sales of our partnership interests from years that the partnerships have not been audited bythe Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Should the tax credits be denied on any future audit and we fail to prevail through the IRSor the legal process, there could be significant refunds of previously recognized income with a significant adverse impact on earningsand cash flows. The production and sale of synthetic fuelqualified for Section 29/45K tax credits if certain requirements were satisfied, including a requirement that the synthetic fueldiffers significantly in chemical composition from the coal used to produce the synthetic fuel and that the fuel was produced froma facility placed in service before July 1, 1998.9We may not be able to generate sufficienttaxable income to realize our deferred tax assets. We have approximately $23.6 million ofalternative minimum tax (“AMT”) credit carryforwards and approximately $7.6 million of federal net operating loss carryforwardsrecorded as deferred tax assets on our consolidated financial statements. Should future results of operations or other factorscause us to determine that it is not more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to fully utilize ourdeferred tax assets, we would then be required to establish a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets. We would increaseour income tax expense by the amount of the tax benefit we do not expect to realize. This would negatively impact our net income(loss) and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial position. Risks Related to our Alternative EnergyBusiness The ethanol industry is changing rapidlywhich could result in unexpected developments that could negatively impact our operations. The ethanol industry has grown significantlyin recent years. According to the RFA, the ethanol industry has grown from approximately 1.5 billion gallons of annual ethanolproduction in 1999 to approximately 13.4 billion gallons of annual ethanol production in 2012. Thus, there have been significantchanges in the supply and demand of ethanol over a relatively short period of time which could lead to difficulty in maintainingprofitable operations at our ethanol plants. If cash flow from operations of ourethanol plants is not sufficient to service debt, the plants could fail and we could lose our entire investment. Our ethanol plants financed approximately60% of plant construction cost with debt. The debt typically has a balloon payment due after five years. The ability of each companyowning the plant to repay borrowings incurred will depend upon the plant’s financial and operating performance. The cashflows and capital resources of an ethanol plant may be insufficient to repay its debt obligations. If a plant cannot service itsdebt, it may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, restructure its indebtedness or seek additional capital.If unable to do so, the value of our investment could decline significantly. The institutional senior lenders to thecompanies which own and operate our ethanol plants hold liens on the plant’s assets. If a company fails to make its debtservice payments, the senior lender will have the right to repossess the plant’s assets in addition to other remedies, whichare superior to our rights as an equity investor. Such action could have a material adverse impact on our investment in the ethanolplant. We operate in a capital intensive industry.Limitations to external financing could adversely affect our financial performance. In general, continued volatility in thecapital markets has resulted in reduced availability of capital for the ethanol industry. We may need to incur additional financingto fund growth of our business or in times of increasing liquidity requirements (such as increases in raw material costs). Anydelays to obtain additional financing, or our inability to do so, could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.10The financial returns on our ethanolinvestments are highly dependent on commodity prices, which are subject to significant volatility and uncertainty, and the availabilityof supplies, so our results could fluctuate substantially. The financial returnson our ethanol investments are substantially dependent on commodity prices, especially prices for corn or other feedstock, naturalgas, ethanol and unleaded gasoline. As a result of the volatility of the prices for these items, the returns may fluctuate substantiallyand our investments could experience periods of declining prices for their products and increasing costs for their raw materials,which could result in operating losses at our ethanol plants. Our returns onethanol investments are highly sensitive to grain prices. Corn is the principal raw material our ethanol plants use toproduce ethanol and co-products. As a result, changes in the price of corn can significantly affect their businesses. Rising cornprices result in higher costs of ethanol and co-products. Because ethanol competes with non-corn-based fuels, our ethanol plantsmay not be able to pass along increased grain costs to their customers. At certain levels, grain prices may make ethanol uneconomicalto produce. The price of corn isinfluenced by weather conditions and other factors affecting crop yields, transportation costs, farmer planting decisions, exports,the value of the U.S. dollar and general economic, market and regulatory factors. These factors include government policies andsubsidies with respect to agriculture and international trade and global and local demand and supply. The significance and relativeeffect of these factors on the price of corn is difficult to predict. Any event that tends to negatively affect the supply of corn,such as adverse weather or crop disease, could increase corn prices and potentially harm the business of our ethanol plants. Increasingdomestic ethanol capacity could boost the demand for corn and result in increased corn prices. Much of the Midwestern United Statesexperienced drought conditions during 2012 which led to a smaller harvest of corn and increased corn prices. Our ethanol plantsmay also have difficulty, from time to time, in physically sourcing corn on economical terms due to supply shortages. Such a shortagecould require our ethanol plants to suspend operations which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results ofoperations. The spread betweenethanol and corn prices can vary significantly. The gross margin at our ethanol plants depends principally on the spreadbetween ethanol and corn prices. Fluctuations in the spread are likely to continue to occur. A sustained narrow or negative spreador any further reduction in the spread between ethanol and corn prices, whether as a result of sustained high or increased cornprices or sustained low or decreased ethanol prices, would adversely affect the results of operations at our ethanol plants. Our risk managementstrategies may be ineffective and may expose us to decreased profitability and liquidity. In an attempt to partially offsetthe impact of volatility of commodity prices, we enter into forward contracts to sell a portion of our ethanol and distillers grainsproduction and to purchase a portion of our corn and natural gas requirements. The financial impact of these risk management activitiesis dependent upon, among other items, the prices involved and our ability to receive or deliver the commodities involved. Riskmanagement activities can result in financial loss when positions are purchased in a declining market or when positions are soldin an increasing market. We vary the amount of risk management techniques we utilize, and we may choose not to engage in any riskmanagement activities. Should we fail to properly manage the inherent volatility of commodities prices, our results of operationsand financial condition may be adversely affected. The market fornatural gas is subject to market conditions that create uncertainty in the price and availability of the natural gas that our ethanolplants use in their manufacturing process. Our ethanol plants rely upon third parties for their supply of natural gas,which is consumed as fuel in the production of11ethanol. The prices forand availability of natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions. These market conditions often are affected by factorsbeyond the ethanol plants’ control, such as weather conditions, overall economic conditions and foreign and domestic governmentalregulation and relations. Significant disruptions in the supply of natural gas could impair the ethanol plants’ ability toeconomically manufacture ethanol for their customers. Furthermore, increases in natural gas prices or changes in our natural gascosts relative to natural gas costs paid by competitors may adversely affect results of operations and financial position at ourethanol plants. Fluctuations in the selling priceof commodities may reduce profit margins at our ethanol plants. Ethanol is marketed as a fuel additive to reduce vehicleemissions from gasoline, as an octane enhancer to improve the octane rating of gasoline with which it is blended and, to a lesserextent, as a gasoline substitute. As a result, ethanol prices are influenced by the supply and demand for gasoline and our ethanolplants’ results of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected if gasoline demand decreases. Distillers grains compete with other proteinbased animal feed products. The price of distillers grains may decrease when the prices of competing feed products decrease. Theprices of competing animal feed products are based in part on the prices of the commodities from which their products are made.Historically, sales prices for distillers grains have tracked along with the price of corn. However, there have been instanceswhen the price increase for distillers grains has lagged price increases in corn prices. The production of distillers grains hasincreased as a result of increases in dry mill ethanol production in the United States. This could lead to price declines in whatwe can sell our distillers grains for in the future. Such declines could have an adverse material effect on our results of operations. Increased ethanolproduction or decreases in demand for ethanol may result in excess production capacity in the ethanol industry, which may causethe price of ethanol, distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil to decrease. According to the RFA,domestic ethanol production nameplate capacity is approximately 14.8 billion gallons per year at January 2013. The RFA estimatesthat, as of January 2013, approximately 50 million gallons per year of additional production capacity is under construction. Currentethanol production capacity exceeds the 2013 RFS requirement which can be satisfied by corn based ethanol (13.8 billion gallons).Excess capacity in the ethanol industry could have an adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations. In a manufacturingindustry with excess capacity, producers have an incentive to manufacture additional products for so long as the price exceedsthe marginal cost of production (i.e., the cost of producing only the next unit, without regard for interest, overhead or fixedcosts). This incentive could result in the reduction of the market price of ethanol to a level that is inadequate to generate sufficientcash flow to cover costs. Excess capacity may alsoresult from decreases in the demand for ethanol, which could result from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, regulatorydevelopments and reduced U.S. gasoline consumption. Reduced gasoline consumption could occur as a result of increased prices forgasoline or crude oil, which could cause businesses and consumers to reduce driving or acquire vehicles with more favorable gasolinemileage or acquire hybrid vehicles. In addition, becauseethanol production produces distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil as co-products, increased ethanol production will alsolead to increased supplies of distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil. An increase in the supply of distillers grains andnon-food grade corn oil, without corresponding increases in demand, could lead to lower prices or an inability to sell our ethanolplants’ distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil production. A decline in the price of distillers grains or non-foodgrade corn oil could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations.12Trade restrictions on ethanol exportscould reduce the demand for ethanol. The European Union began imposing a tariff,on ethanol imported from the United States, of $83.03 per metric ton effective February 23, 2013. If producers and exporters ofethanol are subject to trade restrictions, or additional duties are imposed on exports, it may make it uneconomical to export ethanol.This could result in an oversupply of ethanol in the United States which could have a material adverse effect on the results ofour ethanol operations. We depend on our partners to operatecertain of our ethanol investments. Our investments currently represent bothmajority and minority equity positions. Day-to-day operating control of minority owned plants generally remains with the localfarmers’ cooperative or investor group that has promoted the plant. We may not have the ability to directly modify the operationsof these plants in response to changes in the business environment or in response to any deficiencies in local operations of theplants. In addition, local plant operators, who also represent the primary suppliers of corn and other crops to the plants, mayhave interests, such as the price and sourcing of corn and other crops, that may differ from our interest, which is based solelyon the operating profit of the plant. The limitations on our ability to control day-to-day plant operations could adversely affectplant results of operations. We may not successfully acquire or developadditional ethanol investments. The growth of our ethanolbusiness depends on our ability to identify and develop new ethanol investments. Our ethanol development strategy depends on referrals,and introductions, to new investment opportunities from industry participants, such as ethanol plant builders, financial institutions,marketing agents and others. We must continue to maintain favorable relationships with these industry participants, and a materialdisruption in these sources of referrals would adversely affect our ability to expand our ethanol investments. Any expansion strategywill depend on prevailing market conditions for the price of ethanol and the costs of corn and natural gas and the expectationsof future market conditions. There is increasing competition for suitable sites for ethanol plants. Even if suitable sites or opportunitiesare identified, we may not be able to secure the services and products from contractors, engineering firms, construction firmsand equipment suppliers necessary to build or expand ethanol plants on a timely basis or on acceptable economic terms. Constructioncosts associated with expansion may increase to levels that would make a new plant too expensive to complete or unprofitable tooperate. Additional financing may also be necessary to implement any expansion strategy, which may not be accessible or availableon acceptable terms. Our ethanol plants may be adverselyaffected by technological advances and efforts to anticipate and employ such technological advances may prove unsuccessful. The development and implementation of newtechnologies may result in a significant reduction in the costs of ethanol production. For instance, any technological advancesin the efficiency or cost to produce ethanol from inexpensive, cellulosic sources such as wheat, oat or barley straw could havean adverse effect on our ethanol plants, because those facilities are designed to produce ethanol from corn, which is, by comparison,a raw material with other high value uses. We cannot predict when new technologies may become available, the rate of acceptanceof new technologies by competitors or the costs associated with new technologies. In addition, advances in the development of alternativesto ethanol could significantly reduce demand for or eliminate the need for ethanol.13Any advances in technology which requiresignificant unanticipated capital expenditures to remain competitive or which reduce demand or prices for ethanol would have amaterial adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations. In addition, alternative fuels, additivesand oxygenates are continually under development. Alternative fuel additives that can replace ethanol may be developed, which maydecrease the demand for ethanol. It is also possible that technological advances in engine and exhaust system design and performancecould reduce the use of oxygenates, which would lower the demand for ethanol, and the results of our ethanol operations may bematerially adversely affected. The U.S. ethanol industry is highlydependent upon a myriad of federal and state legislation and regulation and any changes in legislation or regulation could materiallyand adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. The effect of the renewable fuelstandard (“RFS”) program in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (the “2007 Act”) is uncertain.The domestic market for ethanol is largely dictated by federal mandates for blending ethanol with gasoline. The RFS mandatelevel for conventional biofuels for 2013 of 13.8 billion gallons is lower than current constructed nameplate capacity of approximately14.8 billion gallons. Future demand will be largely dependent upon the economic incentives to blend based upon the relative valueof gasoline versus ethanol, taking into consideration the relative octane value of ethanol, environmental requirements and theRFS. Any significant increase in production capacity beyond the RFS level could have a negative impact on ethanol prices. Additionally,the RFS mandate with respect to ethanol derived from grain could be reduced or waived entirely. In August 2012, governors fromeight states petitioned the EPA for a waiver of the RFS requirements. The EPA announced on November 16, 2012 that the request forwaivers of the RFS requirements was denied. A reduction or waiver of the RFS mandate could negatively affect ethanol prices andour future performance. The RFS Flexibility Act was introduced on October 5, 2011 in the U.S. House of Representatives to reduceor eliminate the volumes of renewable fuel use required by RFS based upon corn stocks-to-use ratios. The Domestic Alternative FuelsAct of 2012 was introduced on January 18, 2012 in the U.S. House of Representatives to modify the RFS to include ethanol and otherfuels produced from fossil fuels like coal and natural gas. Our operations and resulting financial performance could be adverselyimpacted if the RFS Flexibility Act or the Domestic Alternative Fuels Act of 2012 are enacted into law. The elimination of the blender’scredit could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations. The American Jobs Creation Act of2004 created the Volumetric Ethanol Tax Credit, referred to as the “blender’s credit.” This credit allowed gasolinedistributors who blended ethanol with gasoline to receive a federal excise tax credit of $0.45 per gallon of pure ethanol, or $0.045per gallon if blended with 10% ethanol (E-10), and $0.3825 per gallon if blended with 85% ethanol (E-85). The $0.45 per gallonincentive for ethanol expired on December 31, 2011. This credit was a significant benefit to our customers and the eliminationof this credit makes our product less attractive to customers. Changes in corporate average fueleconomy standards could adversely impact ethanol prices. Flexible fuel vehicles receive preferential treatment in meetingfederally mandated corporate average fuel economy (“CAFE”) standards for automobiles manufactured by car makers. Highblend ethanol fuels such as E-85 result in lower fuel efficiencies. Absent the CAFE preferences, car makers would not likely buildflexible-fuel vehicles. Any change in CAFE preferences could reduce the growth of E-85 markets and result in lower ethanol prices. Various studies have criticized theefficiency of ethanol, in general, and corn-based ethanol in particular, which could lead to the reduction or repeal of incentivesand tariffs that promote the use14and domestic production of ethanol orotherwise negatively impact public perception and acceptance of ethanol as an alternative fuel. Although many trade groups, academics andgovernmental agencies have supported ethanol as a fuel additive that promotes a cleaner environment, others have criticized ethanolproduction as consuming considerably more energy and emitting more greenhouse gases than other biofuels and as potentially depletingwater resources. Other studies have suggested that corn-based ethanol is less efficient than ethanol produced from switchgrassor wheat grain and that it negatively impacts consumers by causing prices for dairy, meat and other foodstuffs from livestock thatconsume corn to increase. If these views gain acceptance, support for existing measures promoting use and domestic production ofcorn-based ethanol could decline, leading to reduction or repeal of these measures. These views could also negatively impact publicperception of the ethanol industry and acceptance of ethanol as an alternative fuel. Federal support of cellulosic ethanolmay result in reduced incentives to corn-derived ethanol producers. The American Recovery and ReinvestmentAct of 2009 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 provide funding opportunities in support of cellulosic ethanolobtained from biomass sources such as switchgrass and poplar trees. The amended RFS mandates an increasing level of productionof non-corn derived biofuels. These federal policies may suggest a long-term political preference for cellulosic processes usingalternative feedstocks such as switchgrass, silage or wood chips. Cellulosic ethanol has a smaller carbon footprint and is unlikelyto divert foodstuff from the market. Several cellulosic ethanol plants are under development and there is a risk that cellulosicethanol could displace corn ethanol. Our plants are designed as single-feedstock facilities, located in corn production areas withlimited alternative feedstock nearby, and would require significant additional investment to convert to the production of cellulosicethanol. The adoption of cellulosic ethanol as the preferred form of ethanol could have a significant adverse effect on our ethanolbusiness. Our ethanol business is affected by environmental and otherregulations which could impede or prohibit our ability to successfully operate our plants. Our ethanol production facilities are subjectto extensive air, water and other environmental regulations. We have had to obtain numerous permits to construct and operate ourplants. Regulatory agencies could impose conditions or other restrictions in the permits that are detrimental or which increaseour costs. More stringent federal or state environmental regulations could be adopted which could significantly increase our operatingcosts or require us to expend considerable resources. Our ethanol plants emit various airbornepollutants as by-products of the ethanol production process, including carbon dioxide. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court classifiedcarbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act in a case seeking to require the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide in vehicleemissions. In February 2010, the EPA released its final regulations on the Renewable Fuel Standard program (RFS2). We believe ourplants are grandfathered at their current operating capacity, but plant expansion will need to meet a 20% threshold reduction ingreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from a 2005 baseline measurement to produce ethanol eligible for the RFS2 mandate. To expand ourplant capacity, we may be required to obtain additional permits, install advanced technology equipment, or reduce drying of certainamounts of distillers grains. We may also be required to install carbon dioxide mitigation equipment or take other steps in orderto comply with future laws or regulations. Compliance with future laws or regulations of carbon dioxide, or if we choose to expandcapacity at certain of our plants, compliance with then-current regulations of carbon dioxide, could be costly and may preventus from operating our plants as profitably, which may have a negative impact on our financial performance.15The California Air Resources Board (“CARB”)has adopted a Low Carbon Fuel Standard (“LCFS”) requiring a 10% reduction in GHG emissions from transportation fuelsby 2020. An Indirect Land Use Charge is included in this lifecycle GHG emission calculation. On December 29, 2011, the U.S. Districtcourt for the Eastern District of California issued several rulings in federal lawsuits challenging the LCFS. One of the rulingspreliminarily prevents CARB from enforcing these regulations during the pending litigation. On January 23, 2012, CARB unsuccessfullyattempted to appeal these rulings in the U.S. District court for the Eastern District of California and on January 26, 2012 filedanother appeal with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. While this standard is currently being challenged by various lawsuits,implementation of such a standard may have an adverse impact on the market for corn based ethanol in California. While this standardis being challenged by lawsuits, implementation of such a standard could have an adverse impact on the market for corn-based ethanolin California if corn-based ethanol fails to achieve lifecycle GHG emission reductions. This could have a negative impact on ourfinancial performance. Our ethanol business may become subjectto various environmental and health and safety and property damage claims and liabilities. Operations of our ethanol business willexpose the business to the risk of environmental and health and safety claims and property damage claims, such as failure to complywith environmental regulations. These types of claims could also be made against our ethanol business based upon the acts or omissionsof other persons. Serious claims could have a material negative impact on our results of operations, financial position and futurecash flows. Our business is not significantly diversified. Our financial results depend heavily onour ability to operate our ethanol plants profitably. We do not have significant other lines of business or other sources of revenueto depend upon if we are unable to operate our ethanol plants profitably. Such lack of significant diversification could have amaterial negative impact on our results of operations, financial position and future cash flows should our ethanol plants operateunprofitably. Our revenue from the sale of distillersgrains depends upon its continued market acceptance as an animal feed. Distillers grains is a co-product fromthe fermentation of corn to produce ethanol. Antibiotics may be used during the fermentation process to control bacterial contamination;therefore antibiotics may be present in small quantities in distillers grains marketed as animal feed. The U. S. Food and DrugAdministration’s, or FDA’s, Center for Veterinary Medicine has expressed concern about potential animal and human healthhazards from the use of distillers grains as an animal feed due to the possibility of antibiotic residues. If the public becameconcerned about the impact of distillers grains in the food supply or as an acceptable animal feed, the market for distillers grainscould be negatively impacted, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. At certain of our plants, we extract andsell non-food grade corn oil immediately prior to the production of distillers grains. Several studies are trying to determinehow non-food grade corn oil extraction may impact the nutritional value of the resulting distillers grains. If it is determinedthat non-food grade corn oil extraction adversely impacts the energy content of distillers grains, the value of the distillersgrains we sell may be negatively impacted, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations.16The price of distillers grains may declineas a result of restrictions or duties on distillers grains exports from the United Sates. Exports of distiller grains produced inthe United States have been increasing in recent years. However, the export market may be jeopardized if foreign governments imposetrade barriers or other measures to protect the foreign local markets. If producers and exporters of distillers grains are subjectedto trade barriers when selling distillers grains to foreign customers, there may be a reduction in the price of distillers grainsin the United States. Declines in the price we receive for our distillers grains could lead to decreased revenues and may resultin our inability to operate our ethanol plants profitably. We face significantcompetition in the ethanol industry. We face significant competitionfor new ethanol investment opportunities. There are varied enterprises seeking to participate in the ethanol industry. Some enterprisesprovide financial and management support similar to our business model. Other enterprises seek to acquire or develop plants whichthey will directly own and operate. Many of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources and name recognitionthan we do. We must compete for investment opportunities based on our strategy of supporting and enhancing local development ofethanol plant opportunities. We may not be successful in competing for investment opportunities based on our strategy. The ethanol industryis primarily comprised of smaller entities that engage exclusively in ethanol production and large integrated grain companies thatproduce ethanol along with their base grain business. Several large oil companies have entered the ethanol production market. Ifthese companies increase their ethanol plant ownership or other oil companies seek to engage in direct ethanol production, therewould be less of a need to purchase ethanol from independent producers like our ethanol plants. Larger firms offer efficienciesand economies of scale, resulting in lower costs of production. In addition, plants sold as part of a bankruptcy proceeding mayhave significantly lower fixed costs than our ethanol plants. Absent significant growth and diversification, our ethanol plantsmay not be able to operate profitably in a more competitive environment. No assurance can be given that our ethanol plants willbe able to compete successfully or that competition from larger companies with greater financial resources will not have a materiallyadverse impact on the results of our ethanol operations. We may face competitionfrom foreign companies. There is a risk of foreigncompetition in the ethanol industry. Brazil is presently the second largest producer of ethanol in the world. Brazil’s ethanolproduction, which is sugarcane based, has historically been cheaper to produce than corn-based ethanol. If significant additionalforeign ethanol production capacity is created, such facilities could create excess supplies of ethanol, which may result in lowerprices of ethanol. In addition, foreign ethanol producers may be able to produce ethanol at costs lower than ours. These riskscould have significant adverse effects on our financial performance. In addition, the tariffthat protected the U.S. ethanol industry expired at the end of 2011. The U. S. ethanol industry experienced increased competitionfrom ethanol producers outside of the U. S. during 2012. The expiration of the tariff could lead to continued increases in theimport of ethanol produced outside of the U.S. We are exposed tocredit risk from our sales of ethanol and distillers grains to customers.17The inability of a customerto make payments to us for our accounts receivable may cause us to experience losses and may adversely impact our liquidity andour ability to make our payments when due. We may not be ableto hire and retain qualified personnel to operate our ethanol plants. Our ability to attractand retain competent personnel has a significant impact on operating efficiencies and plant profitability. Competition for keyplant employees in the ethanol industry can be intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees. Failureto do so could have a negative impact on our financial results at individual plants. Our plants depend on an uninterrupted supply of energy andwater to operate. Unforeseen plant shutdowns could harm our business. Our plants require a significant and uninterruptedsupply of natural gas, electricity and water to operate. We generally rely on third parties to provide these resources. If thereis an interruption in the supply of energy or water for any reason, such as supply, delivery or mechanical problems and we areunable to secure an adequate alternative supply to sustain plant operations, we may be required to stop production. A productionhalt for an extended period of time could result in material losses. Potential business disruption from factorsoutside our control, including natural disasters, severe weather conditions, accidents, strikes, unexpected equipment failuresand unforeseen plant shutdowns, could adversely affect our cash flow and operating results. The debt agreements for the ethanolplants contain restrictive financial and performance covenants. Our subsidiaries that operate ethanol plants(“ethanol subsidiaries”) have debt agreements that contain covenants with several financial and performance restrictions.A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the applicable agreement. If a default were to occur, the ethanolsubsidiary would likely seek a waiver of that default, attempt to reset the covenant, or refinance the instrument and accompanyingobligations. If the ethanol subsidiary was unable to obtain this relief, the default could result in the acceleration of the totaldue related to that debt obligation. If a default were to occur, the ethanol subsidiary may not be able to pay its debts or borrowsufficient funds to refinance them. In addition, certain lease agreements could also be in default if a default of the debt agreementoccurs. In the past, we have received waivers from our lenders for failureto meet certain financial covenants and have amended our subsidiary loan agreements to change these covenants. No assurance canbe given that, if we are unable to comply with these covenants in the future, we will be able to obtain the necessary waivers oramend our subsidiary loan agreements to prevent a default. Any of these events, if they occur, couldmaterially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The debt agreements for the ethanolplants limit, or otherwise restrict the amount of dividends and other payments the ethanol subsidiaries can transfer to their members. We are dependent on dividends from ourethanol subsidiaries to generate cash flow. Presently, all of our ethanol subsidiaries have debt agreements that limit paymentsto members. Therefore, these companies cannot distribute all of the cash they generate to their members. Furthermore, we may notbe able to use the excess cash flow from one subsidiary to fund corporate needs or needs of another operating ethanol subsidiary.18Changes in interest rates could havea material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations. One Earth has an interest rate swap atJanuary 31, 2013 that, in essence, fixes the interest rate on a portion of its variable rate debt. During fiscal years 2012, 2011and 2010, we recognized losses on this swap. Further reductions in interest rates could increase the liability position of theinterest rate swap, requiring us to record additional expense which could be material. The liability for this interest rate swapcould also result in a default of the term loan agreement’s restrictive financial covenants. In addition, increases in interest ratescould have a negative impact on results of operations as all of the debt our ethanol plants have is variable rate debt. Furthermore,the interest rate swap does not fix the interest rate on the entire portion of the related debt. We rely on information technology inour operations and financial reporting and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security breach of that technologycould harm our ability to efficiently operate our business and report our financial results accurately and timely. We rely heavily on information technologysystems across our operations, including for management of inventory, purchase orders, production, invoices, shipping, accountingand various other processes and transactions. Our ability to effectively manage our business, coordinate the production, distributionand sale of our products and ensure the timely and accurate recording and disclosure of financial information depends significantlyon the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioningto upgraded or replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems through a cyber-attack or otherwise could cause delaysin product sales, reduced efficiency of our operations and delays in reporting our financial results. Significant capital investmentscould be required to remediate any such problem. Security breaches of employee information or other confidential or proprietarydata could also adversely impact our reputation, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. Risks Related to the Exit of our Retailbusiness and Risks Related to our Real Estate Segment. Our future costs associated with administering extended productservice contracts may result in higher than expected costs. We will continue to administer extendedproduct service contracts that have contractual maturities over the next year. To the extent we do not have products or an adequaterepair service network to satisfy warranty claims, we may incur material costs as we would be required to refund cash to customersfor warranted products. We have a significant amount of vacant warehouse and retailspace after the completion of the wind down of our retail business. At January 31, 2013, we own one distributionfacility and 11 former retail store properties comprising approximately 250,000 square feet of vacant real estate. We are currentlymarketing these facilities for lease or sale. We may not be able to successfully lease or sell these properties which could resultin lost opportunities for revenue or future impairment charges related to the carrying value of the associated assets. We alsohave costs related to the vacant properties such as property taxes and utilities that we would have to bear without any revenuefrom such properties. "
5,REX,REX AMERICAN RESOURCES CORP,2012-04-09,"Risk Factors
We encourage you to carefully consider the risks described below andother information contained in this report when considering an investmentdecision in REX common stock. Any of the events discussed in the risk factorsbelow may occur. If one or more of these events do occur, our results ofoperations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially adverselyaffected. In this instance, the trading price of REX stock could decline, andinvestors might lose all or part of their investment.We have concentrations of cash deposits atfinancial institutions that exceed federal insurance limits. We generally have cash deposits that exceed federal insurance limits.Should the financial institutions we deposit our cash at experience insolvencyor other financial difficulty, our access to cash deposits could be limited. Inextreme cases, we could lose our cash deposits entirely. This would negativelyimpact our liquidity and results of operations.The current interest rate environment hasresulted in lower yields on our excess cash.We have experienced lower yields on our excess cash compared tohistorical yields. Should the present economic conditions result in a sustainedperiod of historically low interest rates, our interest income would benegatively impacted.Risks Related to our Synthetic FuelInvestments and Income Tax BenefitsWe face synthetic fuel risks as future IRSaudits may result in the disallowance of previously recognized tax credits.We have recognized investment income of approximately $7.7 million fromthe sales of our partnership interests from years that the partnerships havenot been audited by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Should the tax creditsbe denied on any future audit and we fail to prevail through the IRS or thelegal 9process, there could be significant refunds of previously recognizedincome with a significant adverse impact on earnings and cash flows. The production and sale of synthetic fuel qualified for Section 29/45Ktax credits if certain requirements were satisfied, including a requirementthat the synthetic fuel differs significantly in chemical composition from thecoal used to produce the synthetic fuel and that the fuel was produced from afacility placed in service before July 1, 1998. We may not be able to generate sufficienttaxable income to realize our deferred tax assets.We have approximately $24.0 million of alternative minimum tax (AMT)credit carryforwards recorded as deferred tax assets on our consolidatedfinancial statements. Should future results of operations or other factorscause us to determine that it is not more likely than not that we will generatesufficient taxable income to fully utilize our deferred tax assets, we wouldthen be required to establish a valuation allowance against such deferred taxassets. We would increase our income tax expense by the amount of the taxbenefit we do not expect to realize. This would reduce our net income and couldhave a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financialposition.Risks Related to our Alternative EnergyBusiness Our ethanol investments are subject to therisks of an inexperienced business which could adversely affect returns on ourethanol investments and our results of operations.We do not have long term experience investing in the ethanol industry.We entered into our first agreement to invest in an ethanol plant in November2005. At January 31, 2012, we were invested in five entities that own andoperate seven ethanol production facilities. One facility has been inproduction since 2004, but the remaining facilities all became operational orwere acquired in fiscal year 2008 or later. Our ethanol investments have beenmanaged by our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Operating Officer and ourChief Financial Officer. We do not otherwise have a dedicated ethanoldevelopment or management staff at the parent company level. As a consequence,our ethanol investments are subject to risks including an unproven businessmodel, a lack of operating history and an undeveloped operating structure.These risks could result in our making investments in ethanol plants thatperform substantially below our expectations, which would adversely affect ourresults of operations and financial condition.If cash flow from operations of our ethanolplants is not sufficient to service debt, the plants could fail and we couldlose our entire investment.Our ethanol plants financed approximately 60% of plant constructioncost with debt. The debt typically has a balloon payment due after five years.The ability of each company owning the plant to repay borrowings incurred willdepend upon the plants financial and operating performance. The cash flows andcapital resources of an ethanol plant may be insufficient to repay its debtobligations. If a plant cannot service its debt, it may be forced to reduce ordelay capital expenditures, sell assets, restructure its indebtedness or seekadditional capital. If unable to do so, the value of our investment coulddecline significantly.The institutional senior lenders to the companies which own and operateour ethanol plants hold liens on the plants assets. If a company fails to makeits debt service payments, the senior lender will have the right to repossess the plants assets in addition to other remedies, which are superior to our rights as an equity investor. Such action couldhave a material adverse impact on our investment in the ethanol plant.10We operate in a capital intensive industry.Limitations to external financing could adversely affect our financialperformance. In general, continued volatility in the capital markets has resulted inreduced availability of capital for the ethanol industry. We may need to incuradditional financing to fund growth of our business or in times of increasingliquidity requirements (such as increases in raw material costs). Any delays toobtain additional financing, or our inability to do so, could have a materialadverse impact on our financial results. The financial returns on our ethanolinvestments are highly dependent on commodity prices, which are subject tosignificant volatility and uncertainty, and the availability of supplies, soour results could fluctuate substantially. The financial returns on our ethanol investments are substantiallydependent on commodity prices, especially prices for corn or other feedstock,natural gas, ethanol and unleaded gasoline. As a result of the volatility ofthe prices for these items, the returns may fluctuate substantially and ourinvestments could experience periods of declining prices for their products andincreasing costs for their raw materials, which could result in operatinglosses at our ethanol plants. Our returns onethanol investments are highly sensitive to grain prices. Cornis the principal raw material our ethanol plants use to produce ethanol andco-products. As a result, changes in the price of corn can significantly affecttheir businesses. Rising corn prices result in higher costs of ethanol andco-products. Because ethanol competes with non-corn-based fuels, our ethanolplants generally will be unable to pass along increased grain costs to theircustomers. At certain levels, grain prices may make ethanol uneconomical toproduce. The price of corn is influenced by weather conditions and other factorsaffecting crop yields, transportation costs, farmer planting decisions,exports, the value of the U.S. dollar and general economic, market andregulatory factors. These factors include government policies and subsidieswith respect to agriculture and international trade and global and local demandand supply. The significance and relative effect of these factors on the priceof corn is difficult to predict. Any event that tends to negatively affect thesupply of corn, such as adverse weather or crop disease, could increase cornprices and potentially harm the business of our ethanol plants. Increasingdomestic ethanol capacity could boost the demand for corn and result inincreased corn prices. Our ethanol plants may also have difficulty, from timeto time, in physically sourcing corn on economical terms due to supplyshortages. Such a shortage could require our ethanol plants to suspendoperations which would have a material adverse effect on the financial returnson our ethanol investments and our consolidated results of operations. The spread betweenethanol and corn prices can vary significantly. Thegross margin at our ethanol plants depends principally on the spread betweenethanol and corn prices. Fluctuations in the spread are likely to continue tooccur. A sustained narrow spread or any further reduction in the spread betweenethanol and corn prices, whether as a result of sustained high or increasedcorn prices or sustained low or decreased ethanol prices, would adverselyaffect the results of operations at our ethanol plants. Our risk managementstrategies may be ineffective and may expose us to decreased profitability andliquidity. In an attempt to partially offset theimpact of volatility of commodity prices, we enter into forward contracts tosell a portion of our ethanol and distillers grains production and to purchasea portion of our corn and natural gas requirements. The financial impact of theserisk management activities is dependent upon, among other items, the pricesinvolved and our ability to receive or deliver the commodities involved. Riskmanagement activities can result in financial loss when positions are purchasedin a declining market or when positions are sold in an increasing market. Wevary the amount of risk management techniques we11utilize, and we may choose not to engage in any risk managementactivities. Should we fail to properly manage the inherent volatility of commoditiesprices, our results of operations and financial condition may be adverselyaffected. The market fornatural gas is subject to market conditions that create uncertainty in theprice and availability of the natural gas that our ethanol plants use in theirmanufacturing process. Our ethanol plants relyupon third parties for their supply of natural gas, which is consumed as fuelin the production of ethanol. The prices for and availability of natural gasare subject to volatile market conditions. These market conditions often areaffected by factors beyond the ethanol plants control, such as weatherconditions, overall economic conditions and foreign and domestic governmentalregulation and relations. Significant disruptions in the supply of natural gascould impair the ethanol plants ability to economically manufacture ethanolfor their customers. Furthermore, increases in natural gas prices or changes inour natural gas costs relative to natural gas costs paid by competitors mayadversely affect results of operations and financial position at our ethanolplants. Fluctuations in theselling price of commodities may reduce profit margins at our ethanol plants.Ethanol is marketed as a fuel additive to reduce vehicle emissions fromgasoline, as an octane enhancer to improve the octane rating of gasoline withwhich it is blended and, to a lesser extent, as a gasoline substitute. As aresult, ethanol prices are influenced by the supply and demand for gasoline andour ethanol plants results of operations and financial position may bematerially adversely affected if gasoline demand decreases. Distillers grains compete with other protein based animal feedproducts. The price of distillers grains may decrease when the prices ofcompeting feed products decrease. The prices of competing animal feed productsare based in part on the prices of the commodities from which their productsare made. Historically, sales prices for distillers grains have tracked alongwith the price of corn. However, there have been instances when the priceincrease for distillers grains has lagged price increases in corn prices. The production of distillers grains has increased as a result ofincreases in dry mill ethanol production in the United States. This could leadto price declines in what we can sell our distillers grains for in the future.Such declines could have an adverse material effect on our results ofoperations. Increased ethanol production or decreases indemand for ethanol may result in excess production capacity in the ethanolindustry, which may cause the price of ethanol, distillers grains and corn oilto decrease. According to the RFA, domestic ethanol production nameplate capacityhas increased to approximately 14.9 billion gallons per year at January 2012.The RFA estimates that, as of January 2012, approximately 140 million gallonsper year of additional production capacity is under construction. Excesscapacity in the ethanol industry would have an adverse effect on the results ofour ethanol operations. In a manufacturing industry with excess capacity,producers have an incentive to manufacture additional products for so long asthe price exceeds the marginal cost of production (i.e., the cost of producingonly the next unit, without regard for interest, overhead or fixed costs). Thisincentive could result in the reduction of the market price of ethanol to alevel that is inadequate to generate sufficient cash flow to cover costs. Excess capacity may also result from decreases in the demand forethanol, which could result from a number of factors, including, but notlimited to, regulatory developments and reduced U.S. gasoline consumption.Reduced gasoline consumption could occur as a result of increased prices forgasoline or crude oil, which could cause businesses and consumers to reducedriving or acquire vehicles with more favorable gasoline mileage or acquirehybrid vehicles.12In addition, because ethanol production produces distillers grains andcorn oil as co-products, increased ethanol production will also lead toincreased supplies of distillers grains and corn oil. An increase in the supplyof distillers grains and corn oil, without corresponding increases in demand,could lead to lower prices or an inability to sell our ethanol plantsdistillers grains and corn oil production. A decline in the price of distillersgrains or corn oil could have a material adverse effect on the results of ourethanol operations. Trade restrictions on ethanol exports couldreduce the demand for ethanol. The European Union initiated an anti-dumping and anti-subsidyinvestigation regarding United States exports of ethanol to Europe and UnitedStates policies surrounding ethanol production and use. If producers andexporters of ethanol are subject to trade restrictions, or additional dutiesare imposed on exports, it may make it uneconomical to export ethanol. Thiscould result in an oversupply of ethanol in the United Sates which could have amaterial adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations. We depend on our partners to operate certainof our ethanol investments. Our investments currently represent both majority and minority equitypositions. Day-to-day operating control of minority owned plants generallyremains with the local farmers cooperative or investor group that has promotedthe plant. We may not have the ability to directly modify the operations ofthese plants in response to changes in the business environment or in responseto any deficiencies in local operations of the plants. In addition, local plantoperators, who also represent the primary suppliers of corn and other crops tothe plants, may have interests, such as the price and sourcing of corn andother crops, that may differ from our interest, which is based solely on theoperating profit of the plant. The limitations on our ability to controlday-to-day plant operations could adversely affect plant results of operations.We may not successfully acquire or developadditional ethanol investments. The growth of our ethanol business depends on our ability to identifyand develop new ethanol investments. Our ethanol development strategy dependson referrals, and introductions, to new investment opportunities from industryparticipants, such as ethanol plant builders, financial institutions, marketingagents and others. We must continue to maintain favorable relationships withthese industry participants, and a material disruption in these sources ofreferrals would adversely affect our ability to expand our ethanol investments.Any expansion strategy will depend on prevailing market conditions forthe price of ethanol and the costs of corn and natural gas and the expectationsof future market conditions. There is increasing competition for suitable sitesfor ethanol plants. Even if suitable sites or opportunities are identified, wemay not be able to secure the services and products from contractors,engineering firms, construction firms and equipment suppliers necessary tobuild or expand ethanol plants on a timely basis or on acceptable economicterms. Construction costs associated with expansion may increase to levels thatwould make a new plant too expensive to complete or unprofitable to operate.Additional financing may also be necessary to implement any expansion strategy,which may not be accessible or available on acceptable terms. Our ethanol plants may be adversely affectedby technological advances and efforts to anticipate and employ suchtechnological advances may prove unsuccessful. The development and implementation of new technologies may result in asignificant reduction in the costs of ethanol production. For instance, anytechnological advances in the efficiency or cost to produce ethanol frominexpensive, cellulosic sources such as wheat, oat or barley straw could have anadverse effect on our ethanol plants, because those facilities are designed toproduce ethanol from corn, which is, by comparison, a13raw material with other high value uses. We cannot predict when newtechnologies may become available, the rate of acceptance of new technologiesby competitors or the costs associated with new technologies. In addition,advances in the development of alternatives to ethanol could significantlyreduce demand for or eliminate the need for ethanol. Any advances in technology which require significant unanticipatedcapital expenditures to remain competitive or which reduce demand or prices forethanol would have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanoloperations. In addition, alternative fuels, additives and oxygenates arecontinually under development. Alternative fuel additives that can replaceethanol may be developed, which may decrease the demand for ethanol. It is alsopossible that technological advances in engine and exhaust system design andperformance could reduce the use of oxygenates, which would lower the demandfor ethanol, and the results of our ethanol operations may be materiallyadversely affected. The U.S. ethanol industry is highly dependentupon a myriad of federal and state legislation and regulation and any changesin legislation or regulation could materially and adversely affect our resultsof operations and financial position. The elimination ofthe blenders credit could have a material adverse effect on the results of ourethanol operations. The American Jobs Creation Actof 2004 created the Volumetric Ethanol Tax Credit, referred to as theblenders credit. This credit allowed gasoline distributors who blendedethanol with gasoline to receive a federal excise tax credit of $0.45 pergallon of pure ethanol, or $0.045 per gallon if blended with 10% ethanol(E-10), and $0.3825 per gallon if blended with 85% ethanol (E-85). The $0.45per gallon incentive for ethanol expired on December 31, 2011. This credit wasa significant benefit to our customers and the elimination of this credit makesour product less attractive to customers. The effect of therenewable fuel standard (RFS) program in the Energy Independence and SecurityAct of 2007 (the 2007 Act) is uncertain. Thedomestic market for ethanol is largely dictated by federal mandates forblending ethanol with gasoline. The RFS mandate level for conventional biofuelsfor 2012 of 13.2 billion gallons is lower than current domestic productionlevels. Future demand will be largely dependent upon the economic incentives toblend based upon the relative value of gasoline versus ethanol, taking intoconsideration the relative octane value of ethanol, environmental requirementsand the RFS. Any significant increase in production capacity beyond the RFSlevel could have a negative impact on ethanol prices. Additionally, the RFSmandate with respect to ethanol derived from grain could be reduced or waivedentirely. A reduction or waiver of the RFS mandate could negatively affectethanol prices and our future performance. The RFS Flexibility Act wasintroduced on October 5, 2011 in the U.S. House of Representatives to reduce oreliminate the volumes of renewable fuel use required by RFS based upon cornstocks-to-use ratios. The Domestic Alternative Fuels Act of 2012 was introducedon January 18, 2012 in the U.S. House of Representatives to modify the RFS toinclude ethanol and other fuels produced from fossil fuels like coal andnatural gas. Our operations and resulting financial performance could beadversely impacted if the RFS Flexibility Act or the Domestic Alternative FuelsAct of 2012 are enacted into law. Changes in corporateaverage fuel economy standards could adversely impact ethanol prices.Flexible fuel vehicles receive preferential treatment in meeting federallymandated corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards for automobilesmanufactured by car makers. High blend ethanol fuels such as E-85 result inlower fuel efficiencies. Absent the CAFE preferences, car makers would notlikely build flexible-fuel vehicles. Any change in CAFE preferences couldreduce the growth of E-85 markets and result in lower ethanol prices.14Various studies have criticized theefficiency of ethanol, in general, and corn-based ethanol in particular, whichcould lead to the reduction or repeal of incentives and tariffs that promotethe use and domestic production of ethanol or otherwise negatively impactpublic perception and acceptance of ethanol as an alternative fuel. Although many trade groups, academics and governmental agencies havesupported ethanol as a fuel additive that promotes a cleaner environment,others have criticized ethanol production as consuming considerably more energyand emitting more greenhouse gases than other biofuels and as potentiallydepleting water resources. Other studies have suggested that corn-based ethanolis less efficient than ethanol produced from switchgrass or wheat grain andthat it negatively impacts consumers by causing prices for dairy, meat andother foodstuffs from livestock that consume corn to increase. If these viewsgain acceptance, support for existing measures promoting use and domesticproduction of corn-based ethanol could decline, leading to reduction or repealof these measures. These views could also negatively impact public perceptionof the ethanol industry and acceptance of ethanol as an alternative fuel. Federal support of cellulosic ethanol mayresult in reduced incentives to corn-derived ethanol producers. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the EnergyIndependence and Security Act of 2007 provide funding opportunities in supportof cellulosic ethanol obtained from biomass sources such as switchgrass andpoplar trees. The amended RFS mandates an increasing level of production ofnon-corn derived biofuels. These federal policies may suggest a long-termpolitical preference for cellulosic processes using alternative feedstocks suchas switchgrass, silage or wood chips. Cellulosic ethanol has a smaller carbonfootprint and is unlikely to divert foodstuff from the market. Severalcellulosic ethanol plants are under development and there is a risk thatcellulosic ethanol could displace corn ethanol. Our plants are designed assingle-feedstock facilities, located in corn production areas with limitedalternative feedstock nearby, and would require significant additionalinvestment to convert to the production of cellulosic ethanol. The adoption ofcellulosic ethanol as the preferred form of ethanol could have a significant adverseeffect on our ethanol business. Our ethanol business is affected byenvironmental and other regulations which could impede or prohibit our abilityto successfully operate our plants. Our ethanol production facilities are subject to extensive air, waterand other environmental regulations. We have had to obtain numerous permits toconstruct and operate our plants. Regulatory agencies could impose conditionsor other restrictions in the permits that are detrimental or which increase ourcosts. More stringent federal or state environmental regulations could beadopted which could significantly increase our operating costs or require us toexpend considerable resources. Our ethanol plants emit various airborne pollutants as by-products ofthe ethanol production process, including carbon dioxide. In 2007, the U.S.Supreme Court classified carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Clean AirAct in a case seeking to require the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide in vehicleemissions. In February 2010, the EPA released its final regulations on theRenewable Fuel Standard program (RFS2). We believe our plants are grandfatheredat their current operating capacity, but plant expansion will need to meet a20% threshold reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from a 2005 baselinemeasurement to produce ethanol eligible for the RFS2 mandate. To expand ourplant capacity, we may be required to obtain additional permits, installadvanced technology such as corn oil extraction, or reduce drying of certainamounts of distillers grains. We may also be required to install carbon dioxidemitigation equipment or take other steps in order to comply with future laws orregulations. Compliance with future laws or regulations of carbon dioxide, orif we choose to expand capacity at certain of our plants, compliance withthen-current15regulations of carbon dioxide, could be costly and may prevent us fromoperating our plants as profitably, which may have a negative impact on ourfinancial performance. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) has adopted a Low CarbonFuel Standard (LCFS) requiring a 10% reduction in GHG emissions fromtransportation fuels by 2020. An Indirect Land Use Charge is included in thislifecycle GHG emission calculation. On December 29, 2011, the U.S. Districtcourt for the Eastern District of California issued several rulings in federallawsuits challenging the LCFS. One of the rulings preliminarily prevents CARBfrom enforcing these regulations during the pending litigation. On January 23,2012, CARB unsuccessfully attempted to appeal these rulings in the U.S.District court for the Eastern District of California and on January 26, 2012filed another appeal with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. While thisstandard is currently being challenged by various lawsuits, implementation ofsuch a standard may have an adverse impact on the market for corn based ethanolin California. While this standard is being challenged by lawsuits,implementation of such a standard could have an adverse impact on the marketfor corn-based ethanol in California if corn-based ethanol fails to achievelifecycle GHG emission reductions. This could have a negative impact on ourfinancial performance. Our revenue from the sale of distillersgrains depends upon its continued market acceptance as an animal feed. Distillers grains is a co-product from the fermentation of corn toproduce ethanol. Antibiotics may be used during the fermentation process tocontrol bacterial contamination; therefore antibiotics may be present in smallquantities in distillers grains marketed as animal feed. The U. S. Food andDrug Administrations, or FDAs, Center for Veterinary Medicine has expressedconcern about potential animal and human health hazards from the use ofdistillers grains as an animal feed due to the possibility of antibioticresidues. If the public became concerned about the impact of distillers grainsin the food supply or as an acceptable animal feed, the market for distillersgrains could be negatively impacted, which would have a negative impact on ourresults of operations. At certain of our plants, we extract and sell non-edible corn oilimmediately prior to the production of distillers grains. Several studies aretrying to determine how corn oil extraction may impact the nutritional value ofthe resulting distillers grains. If it is determined that corn oil extractionadversely impacts the energy content of distillers grains, the value of thedistillers grains we sell may be negatively impacted, which would have a negativeimpact on our results of operations.The price of distillers grains may decline asa result of Chinas anti-dumping investigation of distillers grains originatingin the United Sates. Estimates indicate that as much as 10 to 15 percent of the distillergrains produced in the United States will be exported to China in the comingyear. However, this export market may be jeopardized if the Chinese governmentimposes trade barriers in response to the outcome of an antidumpinginvestigation currently being conducted by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce. Ifproducers and exporters of distiller grains are subjected to trade barrierswhen selling distiller grains to Chinese customers, there may be a reduction inthe price of distillers grains in the United States. Declines in the price wereceive for our distillers grains could lead to decreased revenues and mayresult in our inability to operate our ethanol plants profitably.We face significant competition in the ethanolindustry. We face significant competition for new ethanol investmentopportunities. There are varied enterprises seeking to participate in theethanol industry. Some enterprises provide financial and management support16similar to our business model. Other enterprises seek to acquire ordevelop plants which they will directly own and operate. Many of ourcompetitors are larger and have greater financial resources and namerecognition than we do. We must compete for investment opportunities based onour strategy of supporting and enhancing local development of ethanol plantopportunities. We may not be successful in competing for investmentopportunities based on our strategy. The ethanol industry is primarily comprised of smaller entities thatengage exclusively in ethanol production and large integrated grain companiesthat produce ethanol along with their base grain business. Recently, severallarge oil companies have entered the ethanol production market. If thesecompanies increase their ethanol plant ownership or other oil companies seek toengage in direct ethanol production, there would be less of a need to purchaseethanol from independent producers like our ethanol plants. Larger firms offer efficiencies and economies of scale, resulting inlower costs of production. In addition, plants sold as part of a bankruptcyproceeding may have significantly lower costs than our ethanol plants. Absentsignificant growth and diversification, our ethanol plants may not be able tooperate profitably in a more competitive environment. No assurance can be giventhat our ethanol plants will be able to compete successfully or thatcompetition from larger companies with greater financial resources will nothave a materially adverse affect on the results of our ethanol operations. We may face competition from foreigncompanies. There is a risk of foreign competition in the ethanol industry. Brazilis presently the second largest producer of ethanol in the world. Brazilsethanol production, which is sugarcane based, has historically been cheaper toproduce than corn-based ethanol. If significant additional foreign ethanol production capacity iscreated, such facilities could create excess supplies of ethanol, which mayresult in lower prices of ethanol. In addition, foreign ethanol producers maybe able to produce ethanol at costs lower than ours. These risks could havesignificant adverse effects on our financial performance.We are exposed to credit risk from our salesof ethanol and distillers grains to customers. The inability of a customer to make payments to us for our accountsreceivable may cause us to experience losses and may adversely impact ourliquidity and our ability to make our payments when due. We may not be able to hire and retainqualified personnel to operate our ethanol plants. Our ability to attract and retain competent personnel has a significantimpact on operating efficiencies and plant profitability. Competition for keyplant employees in the ethanol industry can be intense, and we may not be ableto attract and retain qualified employees. Failure to do so could have anegative impact on our financial results at individual plants. Our plants depend on an uninterrupted supplyof energy and water to operate. Unforeseen plant shutdowns could harm ourbusiness. Our plants require a significant and uninterrupted supply of naturalgas, electricity and water to operate. We generally rely on third parties toprovide these resources. If there is an interruption in the supply of energy orwater for any reason, such as supply, delivery or mechanical problems and weare unable to secure an adequate alternative supply to sustain plantoperations, we may be required to stop production. A production halt for anextended period of time could result in material losses.17Potential business disruption from factors outside our control,including natural disasters, severe weather conditions, accidents, strikes,unexpected equipment failures and unforeseen plant shutdowns, could adverselyaffect our cash flow and operating results. Our failure to effectively integrate therecently completed acquisition of NuGen could result in an inability to realizethe anticipated benefits of the purchase and adversely affect our business andoperating results. Our recent acquisition of NuGen will involve the integration of acompany that had previously operated independently, which is challenging andtime-consuming. The process of integrating NuGen, a previously privately heldcompany, into REX, a publicly traded company, could result in the loss of keyemployees, the disruption of its ongoing businesses, or inconsistencies in therespective standards, controls, procedures, and policies of the two companies,any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships withcustomers, suppliers, and employees. In addition, the successful combination ofthe companies will require REX to dedicate significant management resources andto potentially expend additional funds for additional staffing, resources andcontrol procedures, all of which could temporarily divert attention from theday-to-day business of the combined company. If we fail to complete an effectiveintegration of NuGen into REX, anticipated growth in revenue, profitability,and cash flow resulting from the purchase of NuGen could be adversely affected.The debt agreements for the ethanol plantscontain restrictive financial and performance covenants. Our subsidiaries that operate ethanol plants (ethanol subsidiaries)have debt agreements that contain covenants with several financial andperformance restrictions. A breach of any of these covenants could result in adefault under the applicable agreement. If a default were to occur, the ethanolsubsidiary would likely seek a waiver of that default, attempt to reset thecovenant, or refinance the instrument and accompanying obligations. If theethanol subsidiary was unable to obtain this relief, the default could resultin the acceleration of the total due related to that debt obligation. If adefault were to occur, the ethanol subsidiary may not be able to pay its debtsor borrow sufficient funds to refinance them. In addition, certain leaseagreements could also be in default if a default of the debt agreement occurs.Any of these events, if they occur, could materially adversely affect ourresults of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The debt agreements for the ethanol plantslimit, or otherwise restrict the amount of dividends and other payments theethanol subsidiaries can transfer to their members. We are dependent on dividends from our ethanol subsidiaries to generatecash flow. Presently, all of our ethanol subsidiaries have debt agreements thatlimit payments to members. Therefore, these companies cannot distribute all ofthe cash they generate to their members. Furthermore, we may not be able to usethe excess cash flow from one subsidiary to fund corporate needs or needs ofanother operating ethanol subsidiary. Changes in interest rates could have amaterial adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations. One Earth and Patriot have interest rate swaps at January 31, 2012that, in essence, fix the interest rate on a portion of their variable ratedebt. During fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recognized losses on theseswaps. Further reductions in interest rates could increase the liabilityposition of the interest rate swaps, requiring us to record additional expensewhich could be material. The liability for these interest rate swaps could alsoresult in a default of the term loan agreements restrictive financialcovenants.18In addition, increases in interest rates could have a negative impacton results of operations as all of the debt our ethanol plants have is variablerate debt. Furthermore, the interest rate swaps do not fix the interest rate onthe entire portion of the related debt. We rely on information technology in ouroperations and financial reporting and any material failure, inadequacy,interruption or security breach of that technology could harm our ability toefficiently operate our business and report our financial results accuratelyand timely. We rely heavily on information technology systems across ouroperations, including for management of inventory, purchase orders, production,invoices, shipping, accounting and various other processes and transactions.Our ability to effectively manage our business, coordinate the production,distribution and sale of our products and ensure the timely and accuraterecording and disclosure of financial information depends significantly on the reliabilityand capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operateeffectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, ora breach in security of these systems through a cyber attack or otherwise couldcause delays in product sales, reduced efficiency of our operations and delaysin reporting our financial results. Significant capital investments could berequired to remediate any such problem. Security breaches of employeeinformation or other confidential or proprietary data could also adverselyimpact our reputation, and could result in litigation against us or theimposition of penalties. Risks Related to the Wind Down and Exit ofour Retail business and Risks Related to our Real Estate Segment. Our future costs associated withadministering extended product service contracts may result in higher thanexpected costs. We will continue to administer extended product service contracts thathave contractual maturities over the next three years. To the extent we do nothave products or an adequate repair service network to satisfy warranty claims;we may incur material costs as we would be required to refund cash to customersfor warranted products. We have a significant amount of vacantwarehouse and retail space after the completion of the wind down of our retailbusiness. At January 31, 2012, we own one distribution facility and 16 formerretail store properties comprising approximately 452,000 square feet that arecompletely or partially vacant. We are currently marketing these facilities forlease or sale. We may not be able to successfully lease or sell theseproperties which could result in lost opportunities for revenue or futureimpairment charges related to the carrying value of the associated assets. We alsohave costs related to the vacant properties such as property taxes andutilities that we would have to bear without any revenue from such properties.   "
8,REX,REX AMERICAN RESOURCES CORP,2011-04-15,"Risk Factors
We encourage you to carefully consider the risks described below andother information contained in this report when considering an investmentdecision in REX common stock. Any of the events discussed in the risk factorsbelow may occur. If one or more of these events do occur, our results ofoperations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially adverselyaffected. In this instance, the trading price of REX stock could decline, andinvestors might lose all or part of their investment. We have concentrations of cash deposits atfinancial institutions that exceed federal insurance limits. We generally have cash deposits that exceed federal insurance limits.Should the financial institutions we deposit our cash at experience insolvencyor other financial difficulty, our access to cash deposits could be limited. Inextreme cases, we could lose our cash deposits entirely. This would negativelyimpact our liquidity and results of operations. 9The current interest rate environment hasresulted in lower yields on our excess cash. We have experienced lower yields on our excess cash compared tohistorical yields. Should the present economic conditions result in a sustainedperiod of historically low interest rates, our interest income would benegatively impacted. Risks Related to our Synthetic FuelInvestments and Income Tax Benefits We face synthetic fuel risks as future IRSaudits may result in the disallowance of previously recognized tax credits. We have recognized investment income of approximately $53.9 millionfrom the sales of our partnership interests from years that the partnershipshave not been audited by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Should the taxcredits be denied on any future audit and we fail to prevail through the IRS orthe legal process, there could be significant refunds of previously recognizedincome with a significant adverse impact on earnings and cash flows. The production and sale of synthetic fuel qualified for Section 29/45Ktax credits if certain requirements were satisfied, including a requirementthat the synthetic fuel differs significantly in chemical composition from thecoal used to produce the synthetic fuel and that the fuel was produced from afacility placed in service before July 1, 1998. We may not be able to generate sufficienttaxable income to realize our deferred tax assets. We have approximately $11.0 million of net deferred tax assets recordedon our consolidated financial statements. Should future results of operationsor other factors cause us to determine that it is unlikely that we willgenerate sufficient taxable income to fully utilize our deferred tax assets; wewould then be required to establish a valuation allowance against such deferredtax assets. We would increase our income tax expense by the amount of the taxbenefit we do not expect to realize. This would reduce our net income and couldhave a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial position.Risks Related to our Alternative EnergyBusiness Certain of our ethanol investments aresubject to the risks of a development stage business which could adverselyaffect returns on our ethanol investment and our results of operations. We do not have long term experience investing in the ethanol industry.We entered into our first agreement to invest in an ethanol plant in November2005. At January 31, 2011, we were invested in five entities that own andoperate seven ethanol production facilities. One facility has been inproduction since 2004, but the remaining facilities all became operational orwere acquired in fiscal year 2008 or later. Our ethanol investments have beenmanaged by our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Operating Officer and ourChief Financial Officer. We do not otherwise have a dedicated ethanoldevelopment or management staff. As a consequence, our ethanol investments aresubject to many of the risks associated with a development stage company,including an unproven business model, a lack of operating history and anundeveloped operating structure. These development stage risks could result inour making investments in ethanol plants that perform substantially below ourexpectations, which would adversely affect our results of operations andfinancial condition. 10If cash flow from operations of our ethanolplants is not sufficient to service debt, the plants could fail and we couldlose our entire investment. Our ethanol plants financed approximately 60% of plant constructioncost with debt. The debt typically has a balloon payment due after five years.The ability of each company owning the plant to repay borrowings incurred willdepend upon the plants financial and operating performance. The cash flows andcapital resources of an ethanol plant may be insufficient to repay its debtobligations. If a plant cannot service its debt, it may be forced to reduce ordelay capital expenditures, sell assets, restructure its indebtedness or seekadditional capital. If unable to do so, the value of our investment coulddecline significantly. The institutional senior lenders to the companies which own and operateour ethanol plants hold liens on the plants assets. If a company fails to makeits debt service payments, the senior lender will have the right to repossessthe plants assets in addition to other remedies, which are superior to ourrights as an equity investor or subordinated lender. Such action could have amaterial adverse impact on our investment in the ethanol plant. We operate in a capital intensive industry.Limitations to external financing could adversely affect our financialperformance. In general, continued volatility in the capital markets has resulted inreduced availability of capital for the ethanol industry. We may need to incuradditional financing to fund growth of our business or in times of increasingliquidity requirements (such as increases in raw material costs). Any delays toobtain additional financing, or our inability to do so, could have a materialadverse impact on our financial results. The financial returns on our ethanolinvestments are highly dependent on commodity prices, which are subject tosignificant volatility and uncertainty, and the availability of supplies, soour results could fluctuate substantially. The financial returns on our ethanol investments are substantiallydependent on commodity prices, especially prices for corn or other feedstock,natural gas, ethanol and unleaded gasoline. As a result of the volatility ofthe prices for these items, the returns may fluctuate substantially and ourinvestments could experience periods of declining prices for their products andincreasing costs for their raw materials, which could result in operatinglosses at our ethanol plants. Our returns onethanol investments are highly sensitive to grain prices. Cornor sorghum are the principal raw materials our ethanol plants use to produceethanol and co-products. As a result, changes in the price of corn or sorghumcan significantly affect their businesses. Rising corn or sorghum prices resultin higher costs of ethanol and co-products. Because ethanol competes withnon-corn-based fuels, our ethanol plants generally will be unable to pass alongincreased grain costs to their customers. At certain levels, grain prices maymake ethanol uneconomical to produce. The price of corn and sorghum is influenced by weather conditions andother factors affecting crop yields, transportation costs, farmer plantingdecisions, exports, the value of the U.S. dollar and general economic, marketand regulatory factors. These factors include government policies and subsidieswith respect to agriculture and international trade, and global and localdemand and supply. The significance and relative effect of these factors on theprice of corn and sorghum is difficult to predict. Any event that tends tonegatively affect the supply of corn or sorghum, such as adverse weather orcrop disease, could increase corn and sorghum prices and potentially harm thebusiness of our ethanol plants. Increasing domestic ethanol capacity couldboost the demand for corn and sorghum and result in increased corn or sorghumprices. Our ethanol plants may also have difficulty, from time to time, inphysically sourcing corn or sorghum on 11economical terms due to supply shortages. Such a shortage could requireour ethanol plants to suspend operations which would have a material adverseeffect on the financial returns on our ethanol investments. The spread betweenethanol and corn and sorghum prices can vary significantly. Thegross margin at our ethanol plants depends principally on the spread betweenethanol and corn or sorghum prices. Fluctuations in the spread are likely tocontinue to occur. A sustained narrow spread or any further reduction in thespread between ethanol and corn prices, whether as a result of sustained highor increased corn prices or sustained low or decreased ethanol prices, wouldadversely affect the results of operations at our ethanol plants. The market fornatural gas is subject to market conditions that create uncertainty in theprice and availability of the natural gas that our ethanol plants use in theirmanufacturing process. Our ethanol plants relyupon third parties for their supply of natural gas, which is consumed as fuelin the manufacture of ethanol. The prices for and availability of natural gasare subject to volatile market conditions. These market conditions often areaffected by factors beyond the ethanol plants control, such as weatherconditions, overall economic conditions and foreign and domestic governmentalregulation and relations. Significant disruptions in the supply of natural gascould impair the ethanol plants ability to economically manufacture ethanolfor their customers. Furthermore, increases in natural gas prices or changes inour natural gas costs relative to natural gas costs paid by competitors mayadversely affect results of operations and financial position at our ethanolplants. Fluctuations in theselling price and production costs of gasoline may reduce profit margins at ourethanol plants. Ethanol is marketed as a fueladditive to reduce vehicle emissions from gasoline, as an octane enhancer toimprove the octane rating of gasoline with which it is blended and, to a lesserextent, as a gasoline substitute. As a result, ethanol prices are influenced bythe supply and demand for gasoline and our ethanol plants results ofoperations and financial position may be materially adversely affected ifgasoline demand or price decreases.New plants under construction or decreases indemand for ethanol may result in excess production capacity in the ethanolindustry, which may cause the price of ethanol and/or distillers grains todecrease. According to the Renewable Fuels Association, or RFA, domestic ethanolproduction nameplate capacity has increased to approximately 14.1 billiongallons per year at January 2011. The RFA estimates that, as of January 2011,approximately 560 million gallons per year of additional production capacity isunder construction. Excess capacity in the ethanol industry would have anadverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments. In a manufacturingindustry with excess capacity, producers have an incentive to manufactureadditional products for so long as the price exceeds the marginal cost ofproduction (i.e., the cost of producing only the next unit, without regard forinterest, overhead or fixed costs). This incentive could result in thereduction of the market price of ethanol to a level that is inadequate togenerate sufficient cash flow to cover costs. Excess capacity may also result from decreases in the demand forethanol, which could result from a number of factors, including, but notlimited to, regulatory developments and reduced U.S. gasoline consumption.Reduced gasoline consumption could occur as a result of increased prices forgasoline or crude oil, which could cause businesses and consumers to reducedriving or acquire vehicles with more favorable gasoline mileage or acquirehybrid vehicles. In addition, because ethanol production produces distillers grains as aco-product, increased ethanol production will also lead to increased suppliesof distillers grains. An increase in the supply of distillers12grains, without corresponding increases in demand, could lead to lowerprices or an inability to sell our ethanol plants distillers grainsproduction. A decline in the price of distillers grains or the distillersgrains market generally could have a material adverse effect on the results ofour ethanol investments. We depend on our partners to operate ourethanol investments. Our investments currently represent both majority and minority equitypositions, and day-to-day operating control of each plant generally remainswith the local farmers cooperative or investor group that has promoted theplant. We may not have the ability to directly modify the operations of theplants in response to changes in the business environment or in response to anydeficiencies in local operations of the plants. In addition, local plantoperators, who also represent the primary suppliers of corn and other crops tothe plants, may have interests, such as the price and sourcing of corn andother crops, that may differ from our interest, which is based solely on theoperating profit of the plant. The limitations on our ability to controlday-to-day plant operations could adversely affect plant results of operations.We may not successfully acquire or developadditional ethanol investments. The growth of our ethanol business depends on our ability to identifyand develop new ethanol investments. Our ethanol development strategy dependson referrals, and introductions, to new investment opportunities from industryparticipants, such as ethanol plant builders, financial institutions, marketingagents and others. We must continue to maintain favorable relationships withthese industry participants, and a material disruption in these sources ofreferrals would adversely affect our ability to expand our ethanol investments.Any expansion strategy will depend on prevailing market conditions forthe price of ethanol and the costs of corn and natural gas and the expectationsof future market conditions. There is increasing competition for suitable sitesfor ethanol plants. Even if suitable sites or opportunities are identified, wemay not be able to secure the services and products from contractors,engineering firms, construction firms and equipment suppliers necessary tobuild or expand ethanol plants on a timely basis or on acceptable economicterms. Construction costs associated with expansion may increase to levels thatwould make a new plant too expensive to complete or unprofitable to operate.Additional financing may also be necessary to implement any expansion strategy,which may not be accessible or available on acceptable terms. Our ethanol plants may be adversely affectedby technological advances and efforts to anticipate and employ suchtechnological advances may prove unsuccessful. The development and implementation of new technologies may result in asignificant reduction in the costs of ethanol production. For instance, anytechnological advances in the efficiency or cost to produce ethanol frominexpensive, cellulosic sources such as wheat, oat or barley straw could havean adverse effect on our ethanol plants, because those facilities are designedto produce ethanol from corn, which is, by comparison, a raw material withother high value uses. We cannot predict when new technologies may becomeavailable, the rate of acceptance of new technologies by competitors or thecosts associated with new technologies. In addition, advances in thedevelopment of alternatives to ethanol could significantly reduce demand for oreliminate the need for ethanol. Any advances in technology which require significant unanticipatedcapital expenditures to remain competitive or which reduce demand or prices forethanol would have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanolinvestments. In addition, alternative fuels, additives and oxygenates arecontinually under development. Alternative fuel additives that can replaceethanol may be developed, which may decrease the demand for ethanol. It is also13possible that technological advances in engine and exhaust systemdesign and performance could reduce the use of oxygenates, which would lowerthe demand for ethanol, and the results of our ethanol investments may bematerially adversely affected. The U.S. ethanol industry is highly dependentupon a myriad of federal and state legislation and regulation and any changesin legislation or regulation could materially and adversely affect our resultsof operations and financial position. The elimination orsignificant reduction of the blenders credit could have a material adverseeffect on the results of our ethanol investments.The cost of production of ethanol is made significantly more competitive withregular gasoline by federal tax incentives. The American Jobs Creation Act of2004 created the Volumetric Ethanol Tax Credit, referred to as the blenderscredit. This credit currently allows gasoline distributors who blend ethanolwith gasoline to receive a federal excise tax credit of $0.45 per gallon ofpure ethanol, or $0.045 per gallon if blended with 10% ethanol (E10), and$0.3825 per gallon if blended with 85% ethanol (E85). The $0.45 per gallonincentive for ethanol was scheduled to expire on December 31, 2010 but wasextended to December 31, 2011. The blenders credit could be eliminated orreduced at any time through an act of Congress and may not be renewed in 2011or may be renewed on different terms. In addition, the blenders credit, aswell as other federal and state programs benefiting ethanol (such as tariffs),generally are subject to U.S. government obligations under international tradeagreements, including those under the World Trade Organization Agreement onSubsidies and Countervailing Measures, and might be the subject of challengesthereunder, in whole or in part. Ethanol can beimported into the U.S. duty-free from some countries, which may undermine theethanol industry in the U.S. Imported ethanol isgenerally subject to a $0.54 per gallon tariff that was designed to offset the$0.45 per gallon ethanol incentive that is available under the federal excisetax incentive program for refineries that blend ethanol in their fuel. Aspecial exemption from the tariff, known as the Caribbean Basin Initiative,exists for ethanol imported from 24 countries in Central America and theCaribbean Islands, which is limited to a total of 7% of U.S. production peryear. Imports from the exempted countries may increase as a result of newplants under development. Since production costs for ethanol in these countriesare estimated to be significantly less than what they are in the U.S., theduty-free import of ethanol through the countries exempted from the tariff maynegatively affect the demand for domestic ethanol and the price at which ourethanol plants sell ethanol. Any changes in the tariff or exemption from thetariff could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanolinvestments. In addition, the North America Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA,allows Canada and Mexico to export ethanol to the United States duty-free. The effect of therenewable fuel standard (RFS) program in the Energy Independence and SecurityAct of 2007 (the 2007 Act) is uncertain. Themandated minimum level of use of renewable fuels in the RFS under the 2007 Actwill increase from 12.95 billion gallons per year in 2010 to 36 billion gallonsper year in 2022. The RFS mandate level for conventional biofuels, whichincludes corn-based ethanol, for 2011 is 12.6 billion gallons. This requirementprogressively increases to 15 billion gallons by 2015 and remains at that levelthrough 2022. The 2007 Act also requires the increased use of advancedbiofuels, which are alternative biofuels produced without using corn starchsuch as cellulosic ethanol and biomass-based diesel, with 21 billion gallons ofthe mandated 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel required to come fromadvanced biofuels by 2022. Required RFS volumes for both general and advancedrenewable fuels in years to follow 2022 will be determined by a governmentaladministrator, in coordination with the U.S. Department of Energy and U.S.Department of Agriculture. Increased competition from other types of biofuelscould have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments.The RFS program and the 2007 Act also include provisions allowingcredits to be granted to fuel producers who blend in their fuel more than therequired percentage of renewable fuels in a given year. 14These credits may be used in subsequent years to satisfy RFS productionpercentage and volume standards and may be traded to other parties. Theaccumulation of excess credits could further reduce the impact of the RFSmandate schedule and result in a lower ethanol price or could result in greaterfluctuations in demand for ethanol from year to year, both of which could havea material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments. Waivers of the RFSminimum levels of renewable fuels included in gasoline could have a materialadverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments.Under the RFS as passed as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the U.S.Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the Secretary ofAgriculture and the Secretary of Energy, may waive the renewable fuels mandatewith respect to one or more states if the Administrator of the U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency, or EPA, determines upon the petition of one or more statesthat implementing the requirements would severely harm the economy or theenvironment of a state, a region or the U.S., or that there is inadequatesupply to meet the requirement. In addition, the 2007 Act allows any otherperson subject to the requirements of the RFS or the EPA Administrator to filea petition for such a waiver. Any waiver of the RFS with respect to one or morestates could adversely offset demand for ethanol and could have a materialadverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments. Changes in corporateaverage fuel economy standards could adversely impact ethanol prices.Flexible fuel vehicles receive preferential treatment in meeting federallymandated corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards for automobilesmanufactured by car makers. High blend ethanol fuels such as E85 result inlower fuel efficiencies. Absent the CAFE preferences, car makers would notlikely build flexible-fuel vehicles. Any change in CAFE preferences couldreduce the growth of E85 markets and result in lower ethanol prices. Various studies have criticized theefficiency of ethanol, in general, and corn-based ethanol in particular, whichcould lead to the reduction or repeal of incentives and tariffs that promotethe use and domestic production of ethanol or otherwise negatively impactpublic perception and acceptance of ethanol as an alternative fuel. Although many trade groups, academics and governmental agencies havesupported ethanol as a fuel additive that promotes a cleaner environment,others have criticized ethanol production as consuming considerably more energyand emitting more greenhouse gases than other biofuels and as potentiallydepleting water resources. Other studies have suggested that corn-based ethanolis less efficient than ethanol produced from switchgrass or wheat grain andthat it negatively impacts consumers by causing prices for dairy, meat andother foodstuffs from livestock that consume corn to increase. If these viewsgain acceptance, support for existing measures promoting use and domesticproduction of corn-based ethanol could decline, leading to reduction or repealof these measures. These views could also negatively impact public perceptionof the ethanol industry and acceptance of ethanol as an alternative fuel. Federal support of cellulosic ethanol mayresult in reduced incentives to corn-derived ethanol producers. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the EnergyIndependence and Security Act of 2007 provide funding opportunities in supportof cellulosic ethanol obtained from biomass sources such as switchgrass andpoplar trees. The amended RFS mandates an increasing level of production ofnon-corn derived biofuels. These federal policies may suggest a long-termpolitical preference for cellulosic processes using alternative feedstocks suchas switchgrass, silage or wood chips. Cellulosic ethanol has a smaller carbonfootprint and is unlikely to divert foodstuff from the market. Severalcellulosic ethanol plants are under development and there is a risk thatcellulosic ethanol could displace corn ethanol. Our plants are 15designed as single-feedstock facilities, located in corn productionareas with limited alternative feedstock nearby, and would require significantadditional investment to convert to the production of cellulosic ethanol. Theadoption of cellulosic ethanol as the preferred form of ethanol could have asignificant adverse effect on our ethanol business. Our ethanol business is affected byenvironmental and other regulations which could impede or prohibit our abilityto successfully operate our plants. Our ethanol production facilities are subject to extensive air, waterand other environmental regulations. We have had to obtain numerous permits toconstruct and operate our plants. Regulatory agencies could impose conditionsor other restrictions in the permits that are detrimental or which increase ourcosts. More stringent federal or state environmental regulations could beadopted which could significantly increase our operating costs or require us toexpend considerable resources. Our ethanol plants emit various airborne pollutants as by-products ofthe ethanol production process, including carbon dioxide. In 2007, the U.S.Supreme Court classified carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Clean AirAct in a case seeking to require the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide in vehicleemissions. In February 2010, the EPA released its final regulations on theRenewable Fuel Standard program (RFS2). We believe our plants are grandfatheredat their current operating capacity, but plant expansion will need to meet a20% threshold reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from a 2005 baselinemeasurement to produce ethanol eligible for the RFS2 mandate. Additionally,legislation is pending in Congress on a comprehensive carbon dioxide regulatoryscheme, such as a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system. To expand our plantcapacity, we may be required to obtain additional permits, install advancedtechnology such as corn oil extraction, or reduce drying of certain amounts ofdistillers grains. The California Air Resources Board has adopted a Low Carbon FuelStandard requiring a 10% reduction in GHG emissions from transportation fuelsby 2020. An Indirect Land Use Charge is included in this lifecycle GHG emissioncalculation. While this standard is being challenged by lawsuits,implementation of such a standard could have an adverse impact on our marketfor corn-based ethanol if determined that in California corn-based ethanolfails to achieve lifecycle GHG emission reductions. Our revenue from the sale of distillersgrains depends upon its continued market acceptance as an animal feed. Distillers grains is a co-product from the fermentation of corn toproduce ethanol. Antibiotics may be used during the fermentation process tocontrol bacterial contamination; therefore antibiotics may be present in smallquantities in distillers grains marketed as animal feed. The U. S. Food andDrug Administrations, or FDAs, Center for Veterinary Medicine has expressedconcern about potential animal and human health hazards from the use ofdistillers grains as an animal feed due to the possibility of antibioticresidues. If the public became concerned about the impact of distillers grainsin the food supply or as an acceptable animal feed, the market for distillersgrains could be negatively impacted, which would have a negative impact on ourresults of operations. The price of distillers grains may decline asa result of Chinas antidumping investigation of distillers grains originatingin the United Sates. Estimates indicate that as much as 10 to 15 percent of the distillergrains produced in the United States will be exported to China in the comingyear. However, this export market may be jeopardized if the Chinese governmentimposes trade barriers in response to the outcome of an antidumpinginvestigation currently being conducted by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce. Ifproducers and exporters of distiller grains are 16subjected to trade barriers when selling distiller grains to Chinesecustomers, there may be a reduction in the price of distillers grains in theUnited States. Declines in the price we receive for our distillers grains couldlead to decreased revenues and may result in our inability to operate theethanol plant profitably. We face significant competition in theethanol industry. We face significant competition for new ethanol investmentopportunities. There are varied enterprises seeking to participate in theethanol industry. Some enterprises provide financial and management supportsimilar to our business model. Other enterprises seek to acquire or developplants which they will directly own and operate. Many of our competitors arelarger and have greater financial resources and name recognition than we do. Wemust compete for investment opportunities based on our strategy of supportingand enhancing local development of ethanol plant opportunities. We may not besuccessful in competing for investment opportunities based on our strategy. The ethanol industry is primarily comprised of smaller entities thatengage exclusively in ethanol production and large integrated grain companiesthat produce ethanol along with their base grain business. Recently, severallarge oil companies have entered the ethanol production market. If thesecompanies increase their ethanol plant ownership or other oil companies seek toengage in direct ethanol production, there would be less of a need to purchaseethanol from independent producers like our ethanol plants. There is a consolidation trend in the ethanol industry, partly a resultof companies recently seeking protection under the United States BankruptcyCode. As a result, firms are growing in size and scope. Larger firms offerefficiencies and economies of scale, resulting in lower costs of production. Inaddition, plants currently being or recently sold as part of a bankruptcyproceeding may have significantly lower costs than our ethanol plants. Absentsignificant growth and diversification, our ethanol plants may not be able tooperate profitably in a more competitive environment. No assurance can be giventhat our ethanol plants will be able to compete successfully or thatcompetition from larger companies with greater financial resources will nothave a materially adverse affect on the results of our ethanol investments.We are exposed to credit risk from our salesof ethanol and distillers grains to customers. The inability of a customer to make payments to us for our accountsreceivable may cause us to experience losses and may adversely impact ourliquidity and our ability to make our payments when due. We may not be able to hire and retainqualified personnel to operate our ethanol plants. Our ability to attract and retain competent personnel has a significantimpact on operating efficiencies and plant profitability. Competition for keyplant employees in the ethanol industry can be intense, and we may not be ableto attract and retain qualified employees. Failure to do so could have anegative impact on our financial results at individual plants. Our plants depend on an uninterrupted supplyof energy and water to operate. Unforeseen plant shutdowns could harm ourbusiness. Our plants require a significant and uninterrupted supply of naturalgas, electricity and water to operate. We generally rely on third parties toprovide these resources. If there is an interruption in the supply of energy orwater for any reason, such as supply, delivery or mechanical problems and weare unable to secure an adequate alternative supply to sustain plantoperations, we may be required to stop production. A production halt for anextended period of time could result in material losses. 17Potential business disruption from factors outside our control,including natural disasters, severe weather conditions, accidents, strikes,unexpected equipment failures and unforeseen plant shutdowns, could adverselyaffect our cash flow and operating results. The debt agreements for the ethanol plantscontain restrictive financial and performance covenants. Our subsidiaries that operate ethanol plants (Ethanol subsidiaries)have debt agreements that contain covenants with several financial andperformance restrictions. A breach of any of these covenants could result in adefault under the applicable agreement. If a default were to occur, the Ethanolsubsidiary would likely seek a waiver of that default, attempt to reset thecovenant, or refinance the instrument and accompanying obligations. If theEthanol subsidiary was unable to obtain this relief, the default could resultin the acceleration of the total due related to that debt obligation. If adefault were to occur, the Ethanol subsidiary may not be able to pay its debtsor borrow sufficient funds to refinance them. In addition, certain leaseagreements could also be in default if a default of the debt agreement occurs.Any of these events, if they occur, could materially adversely affect ourresults of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The debt agreements for the ethanol plantslimit, or otherwise restrict the amount of dividends and other payments theethanol operating subsidiaries can transfer to their members. We are dependent on dividends from our ethanol subsidiaries to generatecash flow. Presently, all of our ethanol subsidiaries have debt agreements thatlimit payments to members. Therefore, these companies cannot distribute all ofthe cash they generate to their members. Furthermore, we may not be able to usethe excess cash flow from one subsidiary to fund corporate needs or needs ofanother operating ethanol subsidiary. Changes in interest rates could have amaterial adverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments. One Earth and Patriot have interest rate swaps at January 31, 2011that, in essence, fix the interest rate on a portion of their variable ratedebt. During fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recognized losses on theseswaps. Further reductions in interest rates could increase the liabilityposition of the interest rate swaps, requiring us to record additional expensewhich could be material. The liability for these interest rate swaps could alsoresult in a default of the term loan agreements restrictive financialcovenants. In addition, increases in interest rates could have a negative impacton results of operations as all of the debt our ethanol plants have is variablerate debt. Furthermore, the interest rate swaps do not fix the interest rate onthe entire portion of the related debt. Risks Related to the Wind Down and Exit ofour Retail business and Risks Related to our Real Estate Segment. Our future costs associated withadministering extended product service contracts may result in higher thanexpected costs. We will continue to administer extended product service contracts thathave contractual maturities over the next three years. To the extent we do nothave products or an adequate repair service network to satisfy warranty claims,we may incur material costs as we would be required to refund cash to customersfor warranted products. We have a significant amount of vacantwarehouse and retail space after the completion of the wind down of our retailbusiness. 18At January 31, 2011, we own one distribution facility and 23 formerretail store properties comprising approximately 492,000 square feet that arecompletely or partially vacant. We are currently marketing these facilities forlease or sale. We may not be able to successfully lease or sell theseproperties which could result in lost opportunities for revenue or futureimpairment charges related to the carrying value of the associated assets. Wealso have costs related to the vacant properties such as property taxes andutilities that we would have to bear without any revenue from such properties.   "
1,REX,REX AMERICAN RESOURCES CORP,2010-04-16,"Risk Factors
We encourageyou to carefully consider the risks described below and other informationcontained in this report when considering an investment decision in REX commonstock. Any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If oneor more of these events do occur, our results of operations, financialcondition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In thisinstance, the trading price of REX stock could decline, and investors mightlose all or part of their investment.We have concentrations of cash deposits at financialinstitutions that exceed federal insurance limits. We generally have cashdeposits that exceed federal insurance limits. Should the financialinstitutions we deposit our cash at experience insolvency or other financialdifficulty, our access to cash deposits could be limited. In extreme cases, wecould lose our cash deposits entirely. This would negatively impact ourliquidity and results of operations.The current interest rateenvironment has resulted in lower yields on our excess cash.We have experienced loweryields on our excess cash compared to historical yields. Should the presenteconomic conditions result in a sustained period of historically low interestrates, our interest income would be negatively impacted.Risks Related to our Synthetic FuelInvestmentsWe face synthetic fuel risks asfuture IRS audits may result in the disallowance of previously recognized taxcredits.9We have recognizedinvestment income of approximately $59.3 million from the sales of ourpartnership interests from years that the partnerships have not been audited bythe Internal Revenue Service (IRS).Should the tax credits be denied on any future audit and we fail to prevailthrough the IRS or the legal process, there could be significant refunds ofpreviously recognized income with a significant adverse impact on earnings andcash flows. The production and sale ofsynthetic fuel qualified for Section 29/45K tax credits if certain requirementswere satisfied, including a requirement that the synthetic fuel differssignificantly in chemical composition from the coal used to produce thesynthetic fuel and that the fuel was produced from a facility placed in servicebefore July 1, 1998. We may not be able to generatesufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets.We have approximately $14.8million of deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated financialstatements. Should future results of operations or other factors cause us todetermine that it is unlikely that we will generate sufficient taxable incometo fully utilize our deferred tax assets; we would then be required toestablish a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets. We wouldincrease our income tax expense by the amount of the tax benefit we do notexpect to realize. This would reduce our net income and could have a materialadverse effect on our results of operations and our financial position.Risks Related to our AlternativeEnergy Business Certain of ourethanol investments are subject to the risks of a development stage businesswhich could adversely affect returns on our ethanol investment and our resultsof operations.We do not have long term experience investing in the ethanol    industry. We entered into our first agreement to invest in an ethanol plant    in November 2005. At January 31, 2010, we remain invested in four entities    that own and operate six ethanol production facilities. One facility has    been in production since 2004, two facilities have been in production since    2008, two facilities became operational and one facility was acquired (by    an equity method investee) in fiscal year 2009. Our ethanol investments have    been managed by our Chief Executive Officer, our Vice President and our Chief    Financial Officer. We do not otherwise have a dedicated ethanol development    or management staff. As a consequence, our ethanol investments are subject    to many of the risks associated with a development stage company, including    an unproven business model, a lack of operating history and an undeveloped    operating structure. These development stage risks could result in our making    investments in ethanol plants that perform substantially below our expectations,    which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.One Earth and BigRiver recently completed construction of new ethanol plants.As these newplants recently became operational, they face uncertainties of whether theywill perform to specifications and whether they will achieve anticipatedoperating results.If cash flow fromoperations of our ethanol plants is not sufficient to service debt, the plantscould fail and we could lose our entire investment.Our ethanolplants financed approximately 60% of plant construction cost with debt. Thedebt typically has a balloon payment due after five years. The ability of eachcompany owning the plant to repay borrowings incurred will depend upon theplants financial and operating performance. The cash flows and capitalresources of an ethanol plant may be insufficient to repay its debtobligations. If a plant cannot service its debt, it may be forced to reduce ordelay capital expenditures, sell assets, restructure its10indebtednessor seek additional capital. If unable to do so, the value of our investmentcould decline significantly.Theinstitutional senior lenders to the companies which own and operate our ethanolplants hold liens on the plants assets. If a company fails to make its debtservice payments, the senior lender will have the right to repossess theplants assets in addition to other remedies, which are superior to our rightsas an equity investor or subordinated lender. Such action could have amaterially adverse impact on our investment in the ethanol plant.The financial returns on our ethanol investmentsare highly dependent on commodity prices, which are subject to significantvolatility and uncertainty, and the availability of supplies, so our resultscould fluctuate substantially.The financialreturns on our ethanol investments are substantially dependent on commodityprices, especially prices for corn or other feedstock, natural gas, ethanol andunleaded gasoline. As a result of the volatility of the prices for these items,the returns may fluctuate substantially and our investments could experienceperiods of declining prices for their products and increasing costs for theirraw materials, which could result in operating losses at our ethanol plants. Ourreturns on ethanol investments are highly sensitive to grain prices. Corn or sorghum are the principal raw materials our ethanol plants use toproduce ethanol and co-products. As a result, changes in the price of corn orsorghum can significantly affect their businesses. Rising corn or sorghumprices result in higher costs of ethanol and co-products. Because ethanolcompetes with non-corn-based fuels, our ethanol plants generally will be unableto pass along increased grain costs to their customers. At certain levels,grain prices may make ethanol uneconomical to produce. The price ofcorn and sorghum is influenced by weather conditions and other factorsaffecting crop yields, transportation costs, farmer planting decisions,exports, the value of the U.S. dollar and general economic, market andregulatory factors. These factors include government policies and subsidieswith respect to agriculture and international trade, and global and localdemand and supply. The significance and relative effect of these factors on theprice of corn and sorghum is difficult to predict. Any event that tends tonegatively affect the supply of corn or sorghum, such as adverse weather orcrop disease, could increase corn and sorghum prices and potentially harm thebusiness of our ethanol plants. Increasing domestic ethanol capacity couldboost the demand for corn and sorghum and result in increased corn or sorghumprices. Our ethanol plants may also have difficulty, from time to time, inphysically sourcing corn or sorghum on economical terms due to supplyshortages. Such a shortage could require our ethanol plants to suspendoperations which would have a material adverse effect on the financial returnson our ethanol investments. Thespread between ethanol and corn and sorghum prices can vary significantly. Thegross margin at our ethanol plants depends principally on the spread betweenethanol and corn or sorghum prices. Fluctuations in the spread are likely tocontinue to occur. A sustained narrow spread or any further reduction in thespread between ethanol and corn prices, whether as a result of sustained high orincreased corn prices or sustained low or decreased ethanol prices, wouldadversely affect the results of operations at our ethanol plants.Themarket for natural gas is subject to market conditions that create uncertaintyin the price and availability of the natural gas that our ethanol plants use intheir manufacturing process. Our ethanol plantsrely upon third parties for their supply of natural gas, which is consumed asfuel in the manufacture of ethanol. The prices for and availability of naturalgas are subject to volatile market conditions. These11marketconditions often are affected by factors beyond the ethanol plants control,such as weather conditions, overall economic conditions and foreign anddomestic governmental regulation and relations. Significant disruptions in thesupply of natural gas could impair the ethanol plants ability to economicallymanufacture ethanol for their customers. Furthermore, increases in natural gasprices or changes in our natural gas costs relative to natural gas costs paidby competitors may adversely affect results of operations and financialposition at our ethanol plants. Fluctuationsin the selling price and production costs of gasoline may reduce profit marginsat our ethanol plants. Ethanol is marketed as afuel additive to reduce vehicle emissions from gasoline, as an octane enhancerto improve the octane rating of gasoline with which it is blended and, to alesser extent, as a gasoline substitute. As a result, ethanol prices areinfluenced by the supply and demand for gasoline and our ethanol plantsresults of operations and financial position may be materially adverselyaffected if gasoline demand or price decreases.New plants underconstruction or decreases in demand for ethanol may result in excess productioncapacity in the ethanol industry, which may cause the price of ethanol and/ordistillers grains to decrease.According tothe Renewable Fuels Association, or RFA, domestic ethanol production nameplatecapacity has increased to approximately 13.0 billion gallons per year atJanuary 2010. The RFA estimates that, as of January 2010, approximately 1.4billion gallons per year of additional production capacity is underconstruction. Excess capacity in the ethanol industry would have an adverse effecton the results of our ethanol investments. In a manufacturing industry withexcess capacity, producers have an incentive to manufacture additional productsfor so long as the price exceeds the marginal cost of production (i.e., thecost of producing only the next unit, without regard for interest, overhead orfixed costs). This incentive could result in the reduction of the market priceof ethanol to a level that is inadequate to generate sufficient cash flow tocover costs.Excesscapacity may also result from decreases in the demand for ethanol, which couldresult from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, regulatorydevelopments and reduced U.S. gasoline consumption. Reduced gasolineconsumption could occur as a result of increased prices for gasoline or crudeoil, which could cause businesses and consumers to reduce driving or acquirevehicles with more favorable gasoline mileage or acquire hybrid vehicles. In addition,because ethanol production produces distillers grains as a co-product,increased ethanol production will also lead to increased supplies of distillersgrains. An increase in the supply of distillers grains, without correspondingincreases in demand, could lead to lower prices or an inability to sell ourethanol plants distillers grains production. A decline in the price ofdistillers grains or the distillers grains market generally could have amaterial adverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments.We depend on our partners to operate ourethanol investments.Our investments currentlyrepresent both majority and minority equity positions, and day-to-day operatingcontrol of each plant generally remains with the local farmers cooperative orinvestor group that has promoted the plant. We may not have the ability todirectly modify the operations of the plants in response to changes in thebusiness environment or in response to any deficiencies in local operations ofthe plants. In addition, local plant operators, who also represent the primarysuppliers of corn and other crops to the plants, may have interests, such asthe price and sourcing of corn and other crops, that may differ from ourinterest, which is based solely on the operating profit of the plant. Thelimitations on our ability to control day-to-day plant operations couldadversely affect plant results of operations.12We may not successfully acquire or developadditional ethanol investments. The growth ofour ethanol business depends on our ability to identify and develop new ethanolinvestments. Our ethanol development strategy depends on referrals, andintroductions, to new investment opportunities from industry participants, suchas ethanol plant builders, financial institutions, marketing agents and others.We must continue to maintain favorable relationships with these industryparticipants, and a material disruption in these sources of referrals wouldadversely affect our ability to expand our ethanol investments. Any expansionstrategy will depend on prevailing market conditions for the price of ethanoland the costs of corn and natural gas and the expectations of future marketconditions. The significant expansion of ethanol production capacity in theUnited States could impede any expansion strategy. There is increasingcompetition for suitable sites for ethanol plants. Even if suitable sites oropportunities are identified, we may not be able to secure the services andproducts from contractors, engineering firms, construction firms and equipmentsuppliers necessary to build or expand ethanol plants on a timely basis or onacceptable economic terms. Construction costs associated with expansion mayincrease to levels that would make a new plant too expensive to complete orunprofitable to operate. Additional financing may also be necessary toimplement any expansion strategy, which may not be accessible or available onacceptable terms. Our ethanol plants may be adversely affectedby technological advances and efforts to anticipate and employ suchtechnological advances may prove unsuccessful. Thedevelopment and implementation of new technologies may result in a significantreduction in the costs of ethanol production. For instance, any technologicaladvances in the efficiency or cost to produce ethanol from inexpensive,cellulosic sources such as wheat, oat or barley straw could have an adverseeffect on our ethanol plants, because those facilities are designed to produceethanol from corn, which is, by comparison, a raw material with other highvalue uses. We cannot predict when new technologies may become available, therate of acceptance of new technologies by competitors or the costs associatedwith new technologies. In addition, advances in the development of alternativesto ethanol could significantly reduce demand for or eliminate the need forethanol. Any advancesin technology which require significant unanticipated capital expenditures toremain competitive or which reduce demand or prices for ethanol would have amaterial adverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments. In addition,alternative fuels, additives and oxygenates are continually under development.Alternative fuel additives that can replace ethanol may be developed, which maydecrease the demand for ethanol. It is also possible that technologicaladvances in engine and exhaust system design and performance could reduce theuse of oxygenates, which would lower the demand for ethanol, and the results ofour ethanol investments may be materially adversely affected. The U.S. ethanol industry is highly dependentupon a myriad of federal and state legislation and regulation and any changesin legislation or regulation could materially and adversely affect our resultsof operations and financial position. The elimination orsignificant reduction of the blenders credit could have a material adverseeffect on the results of our ethanol investments.The cost of production of ethanol is made significantly more competitive withregular gasoline by federal tax incentives. The American Jobs Creation Act of2004 created the Volumetric Ethanol Tax Credit, referred to as the blenderscredit. This credit currently 13allowsgasoline distributors who blend ethanol with gasoline to receive a federalexcise tax credit of $0.45 per gallon of pure ethanol, or $0.045 per gallon ifblended with 10% ethanol (E10), and $0.3825 per gallon if blended with 85%ethanol (E85). The $0.45 per gallon incentive for ethanol is scheduled toexpire on December 31, 2010. The blenders credit could be eliminated orreduced at any time through an act of Congress and may not be renewed in 2010or may be renewed on different terms. In addition, the blenders credit, aswell as other federal and state programs benefiting ethanol (such as tariffs),generally are subject to U.S. government obligations under international tradeagreements, including those under the World Trade Organization Agreement onSubsidies and Countervailing Measures, and might be the subject of challengesthereunder, in whole or in part. Ethanol can beimported into the U.S. duty-free from some countries, which may undermine theethanol industry in the U.S. Imported ethanol isgenerally subject to a $0.54 per gallon tariff that was designed to offset the$0.45 per gallon ethanol incentive that is available under the federal excisetax incentive program for refineries that blend ethanol in their fuel. A specialexemption from the tariff, known as the Caribbean Basin Initiative, exists forethanol imported from 24 countries in Central America and the CaribbeanIslands, which is limited to a total of 7% of U.S. production per year. Importsfrom the exempted countries may increase as a result of new plants underdevelopment. Since production costs for ethanol in these countries areestimated to be significantly less than what they are in the U.S., theduty-free import of ethanol through the countries exempted from the tariff maynegatively affect the demand for domestic ethanol and the price at which ourethanol plants sell ethanol. Any changes in the tariff or exemption from thetariff could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments.In addition, the North America Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA allows Canada andMexico to export ethanol to the United States duty-free. The effect of therenewable fuel standard (RFS) program in the Energy Independence and SecurityAct of 2007 (the 2007 Act) is uncertain. Themandated minimum level of use of renewable fuels in the RFS under the 2007 Actwill increase from 9 billion gallons per year in 2008 to 36 billion gallons peryear in 2022. The RFS mandate level for conventional biofuels, which includescorn-based ethanol, for 2010 is 12 billion gallons. This requirementprogressively increases to 15 billion gallons by 2015 and remains at that levelthrough 2022. The 2007 Act also requires the increased use of advancedbiofuels, which are alternative biofuels produced without using corn starchsuch as cellulosic ethanol and biomass-based diesel, with 21 billion gallons ofthe mandated 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel required to come fromadvanced biofuels by 2022. Required RFS volumes for both general and advancedrenewable fuels in years to follow 2022 will be determined by a governmentaladministrator, in coordination with the U.S. Department of Energy and U.S.Department of Agriculture. Increased competition from other types of biofuelscould have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments.The RFSprogram and the 2007 Act also include provisions allowing credits to begranted to fuel producers who blend in their fuel more than the requiredpercentage of renewable fuels in a given year. These credits may be used insubsequent years to satisfy RFS production percentage and volume standards andmay be traded to other parties. The accumulation of excess credits couldfurther reduce the impact of the RFS mandate schedule and result in a lowerethanol price or could result in greater fluctuations in demand for ethanolfrom year to year, both of which could have a material adverse effect on theresults of our ethanol investments. Waivers of the RFSminimum levels of renewable fuels included in gasoline could have a materialadverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments.Under the RFS as passed as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the U.S.Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the Secretary ofAgriculture and the Secretary of Energy, may waive the renewable fuels mandatewith respect to one or more states if the Administrator of the U.S.Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, determines upon 14the petitionof one or more states that implementing the requirements would severely harmthe economy or the environment of a state, a region or the U.S., or that thereis inadequate supply to meet the requirement. In addition, the 2007 Act allowsany other person subject to the requirements of the RFS or the EPAAdministrator to file a petition for such a waiver. Any waiver of the RFS withrespect to one or more states could adversely offset demand for ethanol andcould have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments.Changes in corporateaverage fuel economy standards could adversely impact ethanol prices.Flexible fuel vehicles receive preferential treatment in meeting federallymandated corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards for automobilesmanufactured by car makers. High blend ethanol fuels such as E85 result inlower fuel efficiencies. Absent the CAFE preferences, car makers would notlikely build flexible-fuel vehicles. Any change in CAFE preferences couldreduce the growth of E85 markets and result in lower ethanol prices. Various studies have criticized theefficiency of ethanol, in general, and corn-based ethanol in particular, whichcould lead to the reduction or repeal of incentives and tariffs that promotethe use and domestic production of ethanol or otherwise negatively impactpublic perception and acceptance of ethanol as an alternative fuel. Although manytrade groups, academics and governmental agencies have supported ethanol as afuel additive that promotes a cleaner environment, others have criticizedethanol production as consuming considerably more energy and emitting moregreenhouse gases than other biofuels and as potentially depleting waterresources. Other studies have suggested that corn-based ethanol is lessefficient than ethanol produced from switchgrass or wheat grain and that itnegatively impacts consumers by causing prices for dairy, meat and otherfoodstuffs from livestock that consume corn to increase. If these views gainacceptance, support for existing measures promoting use and domestic productionof corn-based ethanol could decline, leading to reduction or repeal of thesemeasures. These views could also negatively impact public perception of theethanol industry and acceptance of ethanol as an alternative fuel. Federal support of cellulosic ethanol mayresult in reduced incentives to corn-derived ethanol producers. The AmericanRecovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Energy Independence and SecurityAct of 2007 provide funding opportunities in support of cellulosic ethanolobtained from biomass sources such as switchgrass and poplar trees. The amendedRFS mandates an increasing level of production of non-corn derived biofuels.These federal policies may suggest a long-term political preference forcellulosic processes using alternative feedstocks such as switchgrass, silageor wood chips. Cellulosic ethanol has a smaller carbon footprint and isunlikely to divert foodstuff from the market. Several cellulosic ethanol plantsare under development and there is a risk that cellulosic ethanol coulddisplace corn ethanol. Our plants are designed as single-feedstock facilities,located in corn production areas with limited alternative feedstock nearby, andwould require significant additional investment to convert to the production ofcellulosic ethanol. The adoption of cellulosic ethanol as the preferred form ofethanol could have a significant adverse effect on our ethanol business. Our ethanol business is affected byenvironmental and other regulations which could impede or prohibit our abilityto successfully operate our plants. Our ethanolproduction facilities are subject to extensive air, water and otherenvironmental regulations. We have had to obtain numerous permits to constructand operate our plants. Regulatory agencies could 15imposeconditions or other restrictions in the permits that are detrimental or whichincrease our costs. More stringent federal or state environmental regulationscould be adopted, which could significantly increase our operating costs orrequire us to expend considerable resources. Our ethanolplants emit various airborne pollutants as by-products of the ethanolproduction process, including carbon dioxide. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Courtclassified carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act in a caseseeking to require the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide in vehicle emissions. InFebruary 2010, the EPA released its final regulations on the Renewable FuelStandard program (RFS2). We believe our plants are grandfathered at theircurrent operating capacity, but plant expansion will need to meet a 20%threshold reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from a 2005 baselinemeasurement to produce ethanol eligible for the RFS2 mandate. Additionally,legislation is pending in Congress on a comprehensive carbon dioxide regulatoryscheme, such as a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system. To expand our plantcapacity, we may be required to obtain additional permits, install advancedtechnology such as corn oil extraction, or reduce drying of certain amounts ofdistillers grains. The CaliforniaAir Resources Board has adopted a Low Carbon Fuel Standard requiring a 10%reduction in GHG emissions from transportation fuels by 2020. An Indirect LandUse Charge is included in this lifecycle GHG emission calculation. While thisstandard is being challenged by lawsuits, implementation of such a standardcould have an adverse impact on our market for corn-based ethanol if determinedthat in California corn-based ethanol fails to achieve lifecycle GHG emissionreductions.We face significant competition in theethanol industry. We facesignificant competition for new ethanol investment opportunities. There arevaried enterprises seeking to participate in the ethanol industry. Someenterprises provide financial and management support similar to our businessmodel. Other enterprises seek to acquire or develop plants which they willdirectly own and operate. Many of our competitors are larger and have greaterfinancial resources and name recognition than we do. We must compete forinvestment opportunities based on our strategy of supporting and enhancinglocal development of ethanol plant opportunities. We may not be successful incompeting for investment opportunities based on our strategy. The ethanolindustry is primarily comprised of smaller entities that engage exclusively inethanol production and large integrated grain companies that produce ethanolalong with their base grain business. Recently, several large oil companieshave entered the ethanol production market. If these companies increase theirethanol plant ownership or other oil companies seek to engage in direct ethanolproduction, there would be less of a need to purchase ethanol from independentproducers like our ethanol plants. There is aconsolidation trend in the ethanol industry, partly a result of companiesrecently seeking protection under the United States Bankruptcy Code. As aresult, firms are growing in size and scope. Larger firms offer efficienciesand economies of scale, resulting in lower costs of production. In addition,plants currently being sold as part of a bankruptcy proceeding may havesignificantly lower costs than our ethanol plants. Absent significant growthand diversification, our ethanol plants may not be able to operate profitablyin a more competitive environment. No assurance can be given that our ethanolplants will be able to compete successfully or that competition from largercompanies with greater financial resources will not have a materially adverseaffect on the results of our ethanol investments. 16There is a risk of foreign competition in the ethanolindustry. Ethanolproduced or processed in several countries in Central America and the Caribbeanregion is eligible for tariff reduction or elimination under the CaribbeanBasin Initiative. Brazil, currently the worlds second largest ethanolproducer, makes ethanol primarily from sugarcane which historically has beenless expensive to produce than producing ethanol from corn. Other foreign producersmay be able to produce ethanol at lower input costs, including feedstock,facilities and personnel, than our plants. Ethanol imported from Brazil orother foreign countries, even with the import tariff, or from a Caribbean Basinsource may be a less expensive alternative to domestically produced ethanol. Our plants depend on an uninterrupted supplyof energy and water to operate. Unforeseen plant shutdowns could harm ourbusiness. Our plantsrequire a significant and uninterrupted supply of natural gas, electricity andwater to operate. We generally rely on third parties to provide theseresources. If there is an interruption in the supply of energy or water for anyreason, such as supply, delivery or mechanical problems and we are unable tosecure an adequate alternative supply to sustain plant operations, we may berequired to stop production. A production halt for an extended period of timecould result in material losses. Potentialbusiness disruption from factors outside our control, including naturaldisasters, severe weather conditions, accidents, strikes, unexpected equipmentfailures and unforeseen plant shutdowns, could adversely affect our cash flowand operating results. The debt agreements for the ethanol plantscontain restrictive financial and performance covenants. Ethanolfacility debt covenants contain several financial and performance restrictions.A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under theapplicable agreement. If a default were to occur, we would likely seek a waiverof that default, attempt to reset the covenant, or refinance the instrument andaccompanying obligations. If we were unable to obtain this relief, the defaultcould result in the acceleration of the total due related to that debt obligation.If a default were to occur, we may not be able to pay our debts or borrowsufficient funds to refinance them. In addition, certain lease agreements couldalso be in default if a default of the debt agreement occurs. Any of theseevents, if they occur, could materially adversely affect our results ofoperations, financial condition, and cash flows. Changes in interest rates could have amaterial adverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments. LevellandHockley, One Earth and Patriot all have interest rate swaps at January 31, 2010that, in essence, fix the interest rate on a portion of their variable ratedebt. During fiscal year 2009, we recognized losses on these swaps ofapproximately $2.5 million. Further reductions in interest rates could increasethe liability position of the interest rate swaps, requiring us to recordadditional expense which could be material. The liability for these interestrate swaps could also result in a default of the term loan agreementsrestrictive financial covenants. In addition,increases in interest rates could have a negative impact on results ofoperations as all of the debt our ethanol plants have is variable rate debt.Furthermore, the interest rate swaps do not fix the interest rateon the entire portion of the related debt. Levelland Hockleys interest rateswap expires in April 2010.17 Risks Related to the wind down and exit ofour retail business and our real estate segment. Our future costs associated withadministering extended product service contracts may result in higher thanexpected costs. We willcontinue to administer extended product service contracts that have contractualmaturities over the next four years. To the extent we do not have products oran adequate repair service network to satisfy warranty claims, we may incurmaterial costs as we would be required to refund cash to customers forwarranted products. We have a significant amount of vacantwarehouse and retail space after the completion of the wind down of our retail business.At January 31,2010, we own two distribution facilities and 34 former retail store propertiescomprising approximately 911,000 square feet that are completely or partiallyvacant. We are currently marketing these facilities for lease or sale. We maynot be able to successfully lease or sell these properties which could resultin lost opportunities for revenue or future impairment charges related to thecarrying value of the associated assets. We would also have costs related tothe vacant properties such as property taxes and utilities that we would haveto bear without any revenue from such properties.   "
2,REX,REX AMERICAN RESOURCES CORP,2009-04-16,"Risk Factors
We encourage you to carefully consider the risks described below andother information contained in this report when considering an investmentdecision in REX common stock. Any of the events discussed in the risk factorsbelow may occur. If one or more of these events do occur, our results ofoperations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially adverselyaffected. In this instance, the trading price of REX stock could decline, andinvestors might lose all or part of their investment.We have concentrations of cash deposits atfinancial institutions that exceed federal insurance limits. We generally have cash deposits that exceed federal insurance limits.Should the financial institutions we deposit our cash at experience insolvencyor other financial difficulty, our access to cash deposits could be limited. Inextreme cases, we could lose our cash deposits entirely. This would negativelyimpact our liquidity and results of operations.The current interest rate environment hasresulted in lower yields on our excess cash.We have experienced lower yields on our excess cash compared tohistorical yields. Should the present economic conditions result in a sustainedperiod of historically low interest rates, our interest income would benegatively impacted.Risks Related to the wind down and plannedexit of our retail businessWe may incur lease termination costs if wevacate leased stores prior to the expiration of the lease.We are evaluating stores to close as part of the wind down of ourretail business. We may close stores and warehouses we lease from landlordsprior to the expiration of the lease. In such cases, we may be charged leasetermination costs by the landlord that could be material.8We may not be able to sell our remaininginventory at profitable selling prices.As we continue to liquidate our existing inventory, we may have toreduce the selling price of the products to levels that could result inmaterial losses. At January 31, 2009, we had approximately $22.3 million ofinventory related to our retail business. Our future costs associated withadministering extended product service contracts may result in higher thanexpected costs.We will continue to administer extended product service contracts thathave contractual maturities over the next five years. To the extent we do nothave products or an adequate repair service network to satisfy warranty claims;we may incur material costs as we would be required to refund cash to customersfor warranted products.We may have a significant amount of vacantwarehouse space after we complete the wind down of our retail business.We own two distribution facilities comprising approximately 650,000square feet. We are currently marketing these facilities for lease or sale. Wemay not be able to successfully lease or sell these properties which couldresult in lost opportunities for revenue or future impairment charges relatedto the carrying value of the associated assets.A majority of our owned real estate will beleased to subsidiaries of Appliance Direct upon their taking possession of ourproperties.Subsidiaries of Appliance Direct have agreed to lease 37 ownedproperties from us. Our expected lease revenue from these locations could belower than expected should Appliance Direct or its subsidiaries fail to performpursuant to the lease agreements. Such failures could have a material adverseeffect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Risks Related to our Synthetic Fuel InvestmentsWe face synthetic fuel risks as future IRSaudits may result in the disallowance of previously recognized tax credits.We have been allocated approximately $25.0 million of Section 29/45Ktax credits and recognized investment income of approximately $59.9 millionfrom the sales of our partnership interests from years that the partnershipshave not been audited by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Should the taxcredits be denied on any future audit and we fail to prevail through the IRS orthe legal process, there could be a significant tax liability owed forpreviously taken tax credits or refunds of previously recognized income with asignificant adverse impact on earnings and cash flows. The production and sale of synthetic fuel qualifies for Section 29/45Ktax credits if certain requirements are satisfied, including a requirement thatthe synthetic fuel differs significantly in chemical composition from the coalused to produce the synthetic fuel and that the fuel was produced from a facilityplaced in service before July 1, 1998. We may not be able to generate sufficienttaxable income to realize our deferred tax assets.We have approximately $31.9 million of deferred tax assets recorded onour consolidated financial statements. Should future results of operations orother factors cause us to determine that it is unlikely that we will generatesufficient taxable income to fully utilize our deferred tax assets; we wouldthen be required to establish a 9valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets. We would increaseour income tax expense by the amount of the tax benefit we do not expect torealize. This would reduce our net income and could have a material adverseeffect on our results of operations and our financial position.We may realize capital losses related to oursales of synthetic fuel ownership interests.We have, for income tax purposes, recognized capital gain in the yearof sale for certain sales of our ownership interests in synthetic fuelentities. Should we, in subsequent years, realize a capital loss for income taxpurposes, we may be required to carry the loss back to prior years. This couldresult in the write down of previously used Section 29/45K tax credits. Thiswould reduce our net income and could have a material adverse effect on ourresults of operations.Risks Related to our Alternative EnergyBusiness Certain of our ethanol investments aresubject to the risks of a development stage business which could adverselyaffect the returns on our ethanol investments and our results of operations.We have limited experience investing in the ethanol industry. Weentered into our first agreement to invest in an ethanol plant in November2005. At January 31, 2009, we remain invested in four entities. Three entitiesare currently producing ethanol and one is expected to complete theconstruction of its ethanol production facility by the second quarter of fiscalyear 2009. Our ethanol investments have been managed by our Chief ExecutiveOfficer, our Vice President and our Chief Financial Officer. We do nototherwise have a dedicated ethanol development or management staff. As aconsequence, our ethanol investments are subject to many of the risksassociated with a development stage company, including an unproven business model,a lack of operating history and an undeveloped operating structure. Thesedevelopment stage risks could result in our making investments in ethanolplants that perform substantially below our expectations, which would adverselyaffect our results of operations and financial condition.One Earth and Big River are constructing newethanol plants. As a result, we face significant project development risks thatmay adversely affect our investment returns.Our investments in One Earth and Big River face risks of constructiondelays and cost overruns that could delay or reduce our investment returns.Significant delays in the construction schedules, or material variationsbetween estimated versus actual construction costs, could prevent commencementof plant operations as expected and adversely impact the ability of the plantsto operate profitably.In addition, One Earth and Big River must obtain environmental andother permits, complete arrangements for transportation, water, natural gas andmarketing of the ethanol, and hire and train employees before production canbegin. In some cases, development of infrastructure outside of our control willbe required, including additional rail capacity, adequate water supply,additional ethanol storage facilities and increases in truck fleets totransport ethanol within local markets. The failure to obtain any of thesenecessary elements in a timely manner or on commercially acceptable terms couldadversely affect the profitability of the plants. Once the new plants beginproduction, they face uncertainties of whether they will perform tospecifications and whether they will achieve anticipated operating results.If cash flow from operations of our ethanolplants is not sufficient to service debt, the plants could fail and we couldlose our entire investment.We expect our ethanol plants to finance approximately 60% of plantconstruction cost with debt. The ability of each company owning the plant torepay borrowings incurred will depend upon the plants financial and operatingperformance. The cash flows and capital resources of an ethanol plant may beinsufficient to repay its debt obligations. If a plant cannot service its debt,it may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, 10sell assets, restructure its indebtedness or seek additional capital.If unable to do so, the value of our investment could decline significantly.The institutional senior lenders to the companies which own and operateour ethanol plants hold liens on the plants assets. If a company fails to makeits debt service payments, the senior lender will have the right to repossessthe plants assets in addition to other remedies, which are superior to ourrights as an equity investor or subordinated lender. Such action could have amaterially adverse impact on our investment in the ethanol plant.We depend on our partners to operate ourethanol investments.Our investments currently represent both majority and minority equitypositions, and day-to-day operating control of each plant generally remainswith the local farmers cooperative or investor group that has promoted theplant. We may not have the ability to directly modify the operations of theplants in response to changes in the business environment or in response to anydeficiencies in local operations of the plants. In addition, local plantoperators, who also represent the primary suppliers of corn and other crops tothe plants, may have interests, such as the price and sourcing of corn andother crops, that may differ from our interest, which is based solely on theoperating profit of the plant. The limitations on our ability to controlday-to-day plant operations could adversely affect plant results of operations.We may not successfully acquire or developadditional ethanol investments.Thegrowth of our ethanol business depends on our ability to identify and developnew ethanol investments. Our ethanol development strategy depends on referrals,and introductions, to new investment opportunities from industry participants,such as ethanol plant builders, financial institutions, marketing agents andothers. We must continue to maintain favorable relationships with theseindustry participants, and a material disruption in these sources of referralswould adversely affect our ability to expand our ethanol investments. Anyexpansion strategy will depend on prevailing market conditions for the price ofethanol and the costs of corn and natural gas and the expectations of futuremarket conditions. The significant expansion of ethanol production capacity inthe United States could impede any expansion strategy. There is increasingcompetition for suitable sites for ethanol plants. Even if suitable sites oropportunities are identified, we may not be able to secure the services andproducts from contractors, engineering firms, construction firms and equipmentsuppliers necessary to build or expand ethanol plants on a timely basis or onacceptable economic terms. Construction costs associated with expansion mayincrease to levels that would make a new plant too expensive to complete orunprofitable to operate. Additional financing may also be necessary toimplement any expansion strategy, which may not be accessible or available onacceptable terms.We face significant competition in the ethanolindustry.Weface significant competition for new ethanol investment opportunities. Thereare varied enterprises seeking to participate in the ethanol industry. Someenterprises provide financial support similar to our business model. Otherenterprises seek to acquire or develop plants which they will directly own andoperate. Many of our competitors are larger and have greater financialresources and name recognition than we do. We must compete for investmentopportunities based on our strategy of supporting and enhancing localdevelopment of ethanol plant opportunities. We may not be successful incompeting for investment opportunities based on our strategy. Thereis a consolidation trend in the ethanol industry, partly a result of companiesrecently seeking protection under the United States Bankruptcy Code. As aresult, firms are growing in size and scope. Larger firms offer efficienciesand economies of scale, resulting in lower costs of production. In addition,plants currently being sold as part of a bankruptcy proceeding may havesignificantly lower costs than our ethanol plants. 11Absentsignificant growth and diversification, our ethanol plants may not be able tooperate profitably in a more competitive environment. No assurance can be giventhat our ethanol plants will be able to compete successfully or thatcompetition from larger companies with greater financial resources will nothave a materially adverse affect on the results of our ethanol investments.The financial returns on our ethanol investmentsare highly dependent on commodity prices, which are subject to significantvolatility and uncertainty, and the availability of supplies, so our resultscould fluctuate substantially.Thefinancial returns on our ethanol investments are substantially dependent oncommodity prices, especially prices for corn or other feedstock, natural gas,ethanol and unleaded gasoline. As a result of the volatility of the prices forthese items, the returns may fluctuate substantially and our investments couldexperience periods of declining prices for their products and increasing costsfor their raw materials, which could result in operating losses at our ethanolplants. Our returns on ethanol investmentsare highly sensitive to grain prices. Corn or sorghum is the principal raw materialour ethanol plants use or plan to use to produce ethanol and co-products. As aresult, changes in the price of corn or sorghum can significantly affect theirbusinesses. Rising corn or sorghum prices result in higher costs of ethanol andco-products. Because ethanol competes with non-corn-based fuels, our ethanolplants generally will be unable to pass along increased grain costs to theircustomers. At certain levels, grain prices may make ethanol uneconomical. Theprice of corn and sorghum is influenced by weather conditions and other factorsaffecting crop yields, transportation costs, farmer planting decisions,exports, the value of the U.S. dollar and general economic, market andregulatory factors. These factors include government policies and subsidieswith respect to agriculture and international trade, and global and localdemand and supply. The significance and relative effect of these factors on theprice of corn and sorghum is difficult to predict. Any event that tends tonegatively affect the supply of corn or sorghum, such as adverse weather orcrop disease, could increase corn and sorghum prices and potentially harm thebusiness of our ethanol plants. Increasing domestic ethanol capacity couldboost the demand for corn and sorghum and result in increased corn or sorghumprices. Our ethanol plants may also have difficulty, from time to time, inphysically sourcing corn or sorghum on economical terms due to supplyshortages. Such a shortage could require our ethanol plants to suspendoperations which would have a material adverse effect on the financial returnson our ethanol investments. The spread between ethanol and cornand sorghum prices can vary significantly and may not return to recent highlevels. The grossmargin at our ethanol plants depends principally on the spread between ethanoland corn or sorghum prices. Fluctuations in the spread are likely to continueto occur. A sustained narrow spread or any further reduction in the spreadbetween ethanol and corn prices, whether as a result of sustained high orincreased corn prices or sustained low or decreased ethanol prices, wouldadversely affect the results of operations at our ethanol plants.Ourgross profit on gallons produced at Levelland Hockley and Patriot was muchlower than expected for a majority of fiscal year 2008. Should this trendcontinue, our ethanol plants may generate material future losses fromoperations.The market for natural gas issubject to market conditions that create uncertainty in the price andavailability of the natural gas that our ethanol plants use in theirmanufacturing process. Ourethanol plants rely upon third parties for their supply of natural gas, whichis consumed as fuel in the manufacture of ethanol. The prices for andavailability of natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions. Thesemarket 12conditionsoften are affected by factors beyond the ethanol plants control, such asweather conditions, overall economic conditions and foreign and domesticgovernmental regulation and relations. Significant disruptions in the supply ofnatural gas could impair the ethanol plants ability to economicallymanufacture ethanol for their customers. Furthermore, increases in natural gasprices or changes in our natural gas costs relative to natural gas costs paid bycompetitors may adversely affect results of operations and financial positionat our ethanol plants. Fluctuations in the selling priceand production costs of gasoline may reduce profit margins at our ethanolplants. Ethanolis marketed both as a fuel additive to reduce vehicle emissions from gasolineand as an octane enhancer to improve the octane rating of gasoline with whichit is blended. As a result, ethanol prices are influenced by the supply anddemand for gasoline and our ethanol plants results of operations and financialposition may be materially adversely affected if gasoline demand or pricedecreases.New plants under construction or decreases in demandfor ethanol may result in excess production capacity in the ethanol industry,which may cause the price of ethanol and/or distillers grains to decrease.Accordingto the Renewable Fuels Association, or RFA, domestic ethanol productioncapacity has increased from 1.9 billion gallons per year in January 2001 toapproximately 10.6 billion gallons per year at January 2009. The RFA estimatesthat, as of January 2009, approximately 2.1 billion gallons per year ofadditional production capacity is under construction. Excess capacity in theethanol industry would have an adverse effect on the results of our ethanolinvestments. In a manufacturing industry with excess capacity, producers havean incentive to manufacture additional products for so long as the priceexceeds the marginal cost of production (i.e., the cost of producing only thenext unit, without regard for interest, overhead or fixed costs). Thisincentive could result in the reduction of the market price of ethanol to alevel that is inadequate to generate sufficient cash flow to cover costs.Excesscapacity may also result from decreases in the demand for ethanol, which couldresult from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, regulatorydevelopments and reduced U.S. gasoline consumption. Reduced gasolineconsumption could occur as a result of increased prices for gasoline or crudeoil, which could cause businesses and consumers to reduce driving or acquirevehicles with more favorable gasoline mileage or acquire hybrid vehicles. Inaddition, because ethanol production produces distillers grains as aco-product, increased ethanol production will also lead to increased suppliesof distillers grains. An increase in the supply of distillers grains, withoutcorresponding increases in demand, could lead to lower prices or an inabilityto sell our ethanol plants distillers grains production. A decline in theprice of distillers grains or the distillers grains market generally could havea material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments.Our ethanol plants may be adversely affected bytechnological advances and efforts to anticipate and employ such technologicaladvances may prove unsuccessful. Thedevelopment and implementation of new technologies may result in a significantreduction in the costs of ethanol production. For instance, any technologicaladvances in the efficiency or cost to produce ethanol from inexpensive,cellulosic sources such as wheat, oat or barley straw could have an adverseeffect on our ethanol plants, because those facilities are designed to produceethanol from corn, which is, by comparison, a raw material with other highvalue uses. We cannot predict when new technologies may become available, therate of acceptance of new technologies by competitors or the costs associatedwith new technologies. In addition, advances in the development of alternativesto ethanol could significantly reduce demand for or eliminate the need forethanol. 13Anyadvances in technology which require significant unanticipated capitalexpenditures to remain competitive or which reduce demand or prices for ethanolwould have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments.Inaddition, alternative fuels, additives and oxygenates are continually underdevelopment. Alternative fuel additives that can replace ethanol may bedeveloped, which may decrease the demand for ethanol. It is also possible thattechnological advances in engine and exhaust system design and performancecould reduce the use of oxygenates, which would lower the demand for ethanol,and the results of our ethanol investments may be materially adverselyaffected. The U.S. ethanol industry is highly dependentupon a myriad of federal and state legislation and regulation and any changesin legislation or regulation could materially and adversely affect our resultsof operations and financial position.The elimination orsignificant reduction of the blenders credit could have a material adverseeffect on the results of our ethanol investments.The cost of production of ethanol is made significantly more competitive withregular gasoline by federal tax incentives. The federal excise tax incentiveprogram currently allows gasoline distributors who blend ethanol with gasolineto receive a federal excise tax rate reduction for each blended gallon theysell. If the fuel is blended with 10% ethanol, the refiner/marketer paid $0.051per gallon less tax in 2008, which equates to an incentive of $0.51 per gallonof ethanol (effective January 1, 2009, it was reduced to $0.45 per gallon.).The $0.45 per gallon incentive for ethanol is scheduled to expire in 2010. Theblenders credit could be eliminated or reduced at any time through an act ofCongress and may not be renewed in 2010 or may be renewed on different terms.In addition, the blenders credit, as well as other federal and state programsbenefiting ethanol (such as tariffs), generally are subject to U.S. governmentobligations under international trade agreements, including those under theWorld Trade Organization Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures,and might be the subject of challenges thereunder, in whole or in part. Ethanol can beimported into the U.S. duty-free from some countries, which may undermine theethanol industry in the U.S. Imported ethanol isgenerally subject to a $0.54 per gallon tariff that was designed to offset the$0.45 per gallon ethanol incentive that is available under the federal excisetax incentive program for refineries that blend ethanol in their fuel. Aspecial exemption from the tariff exists for ethanol imported from 24 countriesin Central America and the Caribbean Islands, which is limited to a total of 7%of U.S. production per year. Imports from the exempted countries may increaseas a result of new plants under development. Since production costs for ethanolin these countries are estimated to be significantly less than what they are inthe U.S., the duty-free import of ethanol through the countries exempted fromthe tariff may negatively affect the demand for domestic ethanol and the priceat which our ethanol plants sell ethanol. Any changes in the tariff orexemption from the tariff could have a material adverse effect on the resultsof our ethanol investments. In addition, the North America Free TradeAgreement, or NAFTA, which entered into force on January 1, 1994, allows Canadaand Mexico to export ethanol to the United States duty-free.The effect of therenewable fuel standard (RFS) program in the Energy Independence and SecurityAct signed into law on December 19, 2007 (the 2007 Act) is uncertain.The mandated minimum level of use of renewable fuels in the RFS under the 2007Act increased to 9 billion gallons per year in 2008 (from 5.4 billion gallonsunder the RFS enacted in 2005), further increasing to 36 billion gallons peryear in 2022. The 2007 Act also requires the increased use of advancedbiofuels, which are alternative biofuels produced without using corn starchsuch as cellulosic ethanol and biomass-based diesel, with 21 billion gallons ofthe mandated 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel required to come fromadvanced biofuels by 2022. Required RFS volumes for both general and advancedrenewable fuels in years to follow 2022 will be determined by a governmentaladministrator, in coordination with the U.S. Department of Energy and U.S.Department of Agriculture. Increased competition from other types of biofuelscould have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments.14The RFS program and the 2007 Act also include provisions allowingcredits to be granted to fuel producers who blend in their fuel more than therequired percentage of renewable fuels in a given year. These credits may beused in subsequent years to satisfy RFS production percentage and volumestandards and may be traded to other parties. The accumulation of excesscredits could further reduce the impact of the RFS mandate schedule and resultin a lower ethanol price or could result in greater fluctuations in demand forethanol from year to year, both of which could have a material adverse effecton the results of our ethanol investments.Waivers of the RFS minimum levels ofrenewable fuels included in gasoline could have a material adverse effect onthe results of our ethanol investments. Under the RFS as passed as part of theEnergy Policy Act of 2005, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, inconsultation with the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Energy, maywaive the renewable fuels mandate with respect to one or more states if theAdministrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, determinesupon the petition of one or more states that implementing the requirementswould severely harm the economy or the environment of a state, a region or theU.S., or that there is inadequate supply to meet the requirement. In addition,the 2007 Act allows any other person subject to the requirements of the RFS orthe EPA Administrator to file a petition for such a waiver. Any waiver of theRFS with respect to one or more states could adversely offset demand forethanol and could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanolinvestments. Various studies have criticized the efficiency ofethanol, in general, and corn-based ethanol in particular, which could lead tothe reduction or repeal of incentives and tariffs that promote the use anddomestic production of ethanol or otherwise negatively impact public perceptionand acceptance of ethanol as an alternative fuel. Although many trade groups, academics and governmental agencies havesupported ethanol as a fuel additive that promotes a cleaner environment,others have criticized ethanol production as consuming considerably more energyand emitting more greenhouse gases than other biofuels and as potentiallydepleting water resources. Other studies have suggested that corn-based ethanolis less efficient than ethanol produced from switchgrass or wheat grain andthat it negatively impacts consumers by causing prices for dairy, meat andother foodstuffs from livestock that consume corn to increase. If these viewsgain acceptance, support for existing measures promoting use and domesticproduction of corn-based ethanol could decline, leading to reduction or repealof these measures. These views could also negatively impact public perceptionof the ethanol industry and acceptance of ethanol as an alternative fuel.Levelland Hockleys water treatment plant isnot functioning as planned.The reverse osmosis water treatment plant built to supply water from awastewater treatment facility to its ethanol plant is not able to generate anadequate supply of water in order for the plant to function at full capacity.To date, Levelland Hockley has been able to locate alternative sources of waterto sustain plant operations. However, Levelland Hockley has no long termalternative water supply agreements. If Levelland Hockley cannot correct thedeficiencies at its water treatment plant or successfully sustain alternativesupplies of water, the ability of the plant to continue operations could besignificantly impacted which could result in material losses.The debt agreements for the ethanol plantscontain restrictive financial and performance covenants.Ethanol facility debt covenants contain several financial andperformance restrictions. A breach of any of these covenants could result in adefault under the applicable agreement. If a default were to occur, we wouldlikely seek a waiver of that default, attempt to reset the covenant, orrefinance the instrument and accompanying obligations. If we were unable toobtain this relief, the default could result in the acceleration of the totaldue related to that debt obligation. If a default were to occur, we may not beable to pay our debts or borrow sufficient funds to refinance them. Inaddition, certain lease agreements could also be in default if a15default of thedebt agreement occurs. Any of these events, if they occur, could materiallyadversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cashflows. Changes in interest rates could have amaterial adverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments. LevellandHockley, One Earth and Patriot all have forward interest rate swaps at January31, 2009. During fiscal year 2008, we recognized losses on these swaps ofapproximately $3.8 million. Further reductions in interest rates could increasethe liability position of the interest rate swaps, requiring us to recordadditional expense which could be material. The liability for these interestrate swaps could also result in a default of the term loan agreementsrestrictive financial covenants.   "
16,REX,REX AMERICAN RESOURCES CORP,2008-04-14,"Risk Factors
 We encourageyou to carefully consider the risks described below and other informationcontained in this report when considering an investment decision in REX commonstock. Any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If oneor more of these events do occur, our results of operations, financial conditionor cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In this instance, thetrading price of REX stock could decline, and investors might lose all or partof their investment. We have concentrations of cash deposits atfinancial institutions that exceed federal insurance limits. We generallyhave cash deposits that exceed federal insurance limits. Should the financialinstitutions we deposit our cash at experience insolvency or other financialdifficulty, our access to cash deposits could be limited. In extreme cases, wecould lose our cash deposits entirely. This would negatively impact ourliquidity and results of operations. 13Risks Related to our Retail Business We face significant competition from otherretailers many of whom have greater financial resources. This could result in adecline of our sales and profitability. We facesignificant competition from a diverse group of retailers. Our competitorsinclude national and regional large format merchandisers and superstores suchas Best Buy Co., Inc., Lowes Corporation, Home Depot, Inc. and Circuit CityStores, Inc., other specialty electronics retailers including RadioShackCorporation, department and discount stores such as Sears, Roebuck and Co. andWal-Mart Stores, Inc., furniture stores, warehouse clubs, home improvementretailers and Internet and store-based retailers who sell consumer electronicsand home appliance products online. We also compete with small chains andspecialty single-store operators in some markets, as well as Sears dealer-operatedunits. Some of our competitors have greater financial resources than us, whichmay increase their ability to purchase inventory at a lower cost, betterwithstand economic downturns or engage in aggressive price competition. We expectcompetition within the consumer electronics/appliance retailing industry toincrease. National merchandisers continue to expand their geographic marketsand enter markets traditionally served by us. In the event that competitorsenter markets we serve, we may experience pricing pressures, reduced grossmargins and declines in comparable store sales. A decline in economic conditions could leadto reduced consumer demand for the products we sell. Demand forconsumer electronics and home appliance products is dependent upon variouseconomic factors outside of our control. These factors include:     general economic conditions;      consumer confidence;     consumer spending patterns and preferences; and      new housing starts. A slowdown inthe national or regional economies or an uncertain economic outlook couldadversely affect discretionary consumer spending habits and negatively impactour sales and operating results. If new products are not introduced orconsumers do not accept new products, our sales may decline. We rely uponthe periodic introduction of new products to help stimulate consumer demand.The lack of new products could reduce consumer interest and lower our sales. In addition,many products which incorporate the newest technologies, such as highdefinition television, are subject to technological and pricing limitations andmay not achieve widespread or rapid consumer acceptance in the markets weserve. If these new products do not meet with widespread or rapid market acceptance,our results of operations may be impaired. Furthermore,the introduction or expected introduction of new products may depress sales ofexisting products and technologies. Government mandates for such areas as highdefinition television tuners can increase production costs and lead to higherretail prices that could reduce product acceptance. Other mandates include theDepartment of Energy compliance mandates for major appliances that went intoeffect in 2007. This could also lead to higher retail prices and a slowdown inoverall product demand. If we do not adequately anticipate andrespond to changing consumer demand and preferences, our results of operationsmay be impaired. 14Our successdepends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely mannerto changing consumer demand and preferences regarding consumer electronics andhome appliances. Our failure to adequately anticipate and respond to thesechanges could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operationand financial condition either from lost sales or lower margins due to the needto mark down excess inventory. Our opportunistic product buying strategycould negatively impact our sales and gross margins. Whenavailable, we may purchase large quantities of merchandise on an opportunisticor when-available basis at favorable prices. Our inability to find suitableopportunistic product buying opportunities could negatively impact our salesand gross margins. As manufacturers move to more market-driven, supply chainmanagement strategies, the opportunities for opportunistic purchases maydecline. Productspurchased on an opportunistic basis generally are held in inventory longer thanour other products. This can result in increased inventory levels and lowerinventory turnover, which increase our working capital requirements andinventory carrying costs. Increased inventory levels and lower turnover ratesalso increase the risk of inventory mark-downs. The introduction ofdigitally-based display products such as plasma, LCD and other micro displayproducts has shortened product life cycles and introduced a higher degree ofrisk for opportunistic buying. Given the rate of change of technology and pricelevels, opportunity costs for purchasing in large quantities can be offset bythe obsolescence risk of holding merchandise that may have to be deeplydiscounted to consumers. Fluctuations in our comparable store salesmay cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. Comparablestore sales is a term we use to compare the year over year sales performanceof our stores. We consider a store to be comparable after it has been open sixfull fiscal quarters. A number offactors have historically affected and will continue to affect our comparablestore sales, including the following:     competition;     national and regional economic conditions;     consumer trends;    new product introductions;     weather conditions which can impact store traffic as well as sales of seasonal products such as air conditioners;      changes in our product mix and availability of products from key vendors;      duration of the holiday selling season;      timing of promotional events; and      attracting and retaining qualified sales personnel. Comparablestore sales are often followed closely by the investment community andsignificant fluctuations in these results could cause the price of our commonstock to fluctuate substantially. Our quarterly operating results are subjectto seasonality. Our profitability would be adversely affected by lower thanexpected fourth quarter results. Our retailbusiness is seasonal. Our net retail sales and net income historically havebeen highest in our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the Christmas sellingseason. The fourth quarter accounted for approximately 32% and 30% of our netsales and revenue, and 30% and 29% of our gross profit in fiscal year 2007 and 152006,respectively. Our annual financial results would be adversely impacted if our saleswere to fall substantially below what we normally expect during this period. We depend on our suppliers for products andour business could be adversely affected if we do not maintain relationshipswith our key vendors. Our successdepends to a significant degree upon our suppliers of consumer electronics andhome appliance products. We do not have any long-term supply agreements orexclusive arrangements with vendors. We typically order merchandise by issuingindividual purchase orders to vendors. We rely significantly on a fewsuppliers. Our 10 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 86% of ourpurchases during fiscal year 2007, with four suppliers representingapproximately 50% of our inventory purchases in fiscal year 2007. The loss ofany of these key vendors, our failure to establish and maintain relationshipswith our vendors, or any prolonged disruptions in product supply, could have amaterial adverse impact on our business. We may incur higher costs or decreased salesand gross margins because we purchase imported products. A significantportion of our inventory is manufactured outside the United States. Changes intrade regulations, currency fluctuations or other factors may increase the costof items manufactured outside the United States or create shortages of thoseitems. We purchase all of our products in U.S. dollars. Significant reductionsin the cost of such items in U.S. dollars may cause a significant reduction inretail price levels of those products, which could adversely affect our salesand gross margins. The loss of the services of our ChiefExecutive Officer or our other key employees could jeopardize our ability tomaintain our competitive position. We believethat our success depends on the continued service of our key executivemanagement personnel. Loss of the services of Stuart Rose, our Chairman andChief Executive Officer, or other key employees could jeopardize our ability tomaintain our competitive position in the industry. Risks Related to our Synthetic FuelInvestments Income and tax credits from our investmentsin facilities producing synthetic fuel have contributed significantly to ouroperating and net income in past years but will not continue after December 31,2007. In fiscal year1998, we invested in two limited partnerships, Colona Synfuel LimitedPartnership, L.L.L.P. (Colona) and Somerset Synfuel, L.P. (Somerset), which ownfacilities producing synthetic fuel. In fiscal year 2002, we purchased a plantlocated in Gillette, Wyoming (Gillette) designed and constructed for theproduction of synthetic fuel. The entities earned federal income tax creditsunder Section 29/45K of the Internal Revenue Code based on the quantity andcontent of synthetic fuel production and sales. We sold ourinterest in the Colona partnership in three separate sale transactions andreceived cash payments from the sales on a quarterly basis through 2007,subject to production levels. We reported income from the sales ofapproximately $4.2 million and $5.3 million in fiscal years 2007 and 2006,respectively, which accounted for approximately 11% and 35% of our income fromcontinuing operations before income taxes and minority interest in those years.The loss of this income will significantly reduce our net income. We also soldour interest in the limited liability company that owned the Gillette facilityand received $2.75 million at the time of the sale in March 2004. This plantwas dismantled and relocated. The facility resumed commercial operations in thesecond quarter of 2005 and we received an additional $3.5 million. We were 16also eligibleto receive $1.50 per ton of qualified production fuel produced by thefacility and sold through 2007. The plant was subsequently sold and during thethird quarter of fiscal year 2006, we modified our agreement with the ownersand operators of the synthetic fuel facility. Based on the terms of themodified agreement, we currently are not able to determine the likelihood andtiming of collecting payments related to production occurring after September30, 2006. Thus, we cannot currently determine the timing of income recognition,if any, related to production occurring subsequent to September 30, 2006. EffectiveOctober 1, 2005, we sold our entire ownership interest in the Somersetpartnership. We received $1.2 million, net of commissions, at closing alongwith a secured contingent payment note that could provide additional investmentincome. We received quarterly payments through 2007 equal to 80% of the Section29/45K tax credits attributable to the ownership interest sold, subject toproduction levels. We reported income from the sale of approximately $2.8million and $4.4 million in fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively. The lossof this income will significantly reduce our net income. The Section29/45K tax credit program expired on December 31, 2007. We will not receiveincome related to Section 29/45K tax credits for the production and sale ofsynthetic fuel after that date. We face synthetic fuel risks as future IRSaudits may result in the disallowance of previously recognized tax credits. We have beenallocated approximately $25.0 million of Section 29/45K tax credits andrecognized investment income of approximately $97.6 million from the sales ofits partnership interests from years that the partnerships have not beenaudited by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Should the tax credits be deniedon any future audit and we fail to prevail through the IRS or the legalprocess, there could be a significant tax liability owed for previously takentax credits or previously recognized income with a significant adverse impacton earnings and cash flows. The productionand sale of synthetic fuel qualifies for Section 29/45K tax credits if certainrequirements are satisfied, including a requirement that the synthetic fueldiffers significantly in chemical composition from the coal used to produce thesynthetic fuel and that the fuel was produced from a facility placed in servicebefore July 1, 1998. We may not be able to generate sufficienttaxable income to realize our deferred tax assets. We haveapproximately $32.5 million of deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidatedfinancial statements. Should future results of operations or other factorscause us to determine that it is unlikely that we will generate sufficienttaxable income to fully utilize our deferred tax assets, we would then berequired to establish a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets.We would increase our income tax expense by the amount of the tax benefit we donot expect to realize. This would reduce our net income and could have amaterial adverse effect on our results of operations. We may realize capital losses related to oursales of synthetic fuel ownership interests. We have, forincome tax purposes, recognized capital gain in the year of sale for certainsales of our ownership interests in synthetic fuel entities. Should we, insubsequent years, realize a capital loss for income tax purposes, we may berequired to carry the loss back to prior years. This could result in the writedown of previously used Section 29/45K tax credits. This would reduce our netincome and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Risks Related to our Alternative EnergyBusiness 17Our ethanol investments are subject to therisks of a development stage business which could adversely affect the returnson our ethanol investments and our results of operations. We do not havean established record for investing in the ethanol industry. We entered intoour first agreement to invest in an ethanol plant in November 2005. At January31, 2008, we remain invested in four entities. Three entities have begunconstruction of ethanol production facilities and one recently completed an expansionof its ethanol production facility. Our ethanol investments have been managedby our Chief Executive Officer, our Vice President and our Chief FinancialOfficer. We do not otherwise have a dedicated ethanol development staff. As aconsequence, our ethanol investments are subject to all of the risks associatedwith a development stage company, including an unproven business model, a lackof operating history and an undeveloped operating structure. These developmentstage risks could result in our making investments in ethanol plants thatperform substantially below our expectations, which would adversely affect ourresults of operations and financial condition. We invest in new construction of ethanolplants and significant expansion of existing plants. As a result, we facesignificant project development risks that may adversely affect our investmentreturns. In each of ourinvestments, we are investing in the new construction of a plant or asignificant expansion of an existing plant. As a result, our investments facerisks of construction delays and cost overruns that could delay or reduce ourinvestment returns. Significant delays in the construction schedule, ormaterial variations between estimated versus actual construction cost, couldprevent commencement of plant operations as expected and adversely impact theability of the plant to operate profitably. In addition,the new plants are development-stage operations that must obtain environmentaland other permits, complete arrangements for transportation, water, natural gasand marketing of the ethanol, and hire and train employees before productioncan begin. In some cases, development of infrastructure outside of our controlwill be required, including additional rail capacity, adequate water supply,additional ethanol storage facilities and increases in truck fleets totransport ethanol within local markets. The failure to obtain any of thesenecessary elements in a timely manner or on commercially acceptable terms couldadversely affect the profitability of each plant. Once the new plants orexpansions begin production, they face uncertainties of whether they willperform to specifications and whether they will achieve anticipated operatingresults. If cash flow from operations of our ethanol plantsis not sufficient to service its debt, the plant could fail and we could loseour entire investment. We expect ourethanol plants to finance approximately 60% of plant construction cost withdebt. The ability of each company owning the plant to repay borrowings incurredwill depend upon the plants financial and operating performance. The cashflows and capital resources of an ethanol plant may be insufficient to repayits debt obligations. If a plant cannot service its debt, it may be forced to reduceor delay capital expenditures, sell assets, restructure its indebtedness orseek additional capital. If unable to do so, the value of our investment coulddecline significantly. Theinstitutional senior lenders to the companies which own and operate our ethanolplants hold liens on the plants assets. If a company fails to make its debtservice payments, the senior lender will have the right to repossess theplants assets in addition to other remedies, which are superior to our rightsas an equity investor or subordinated lender. Such action could have amaterially adverse impact on our investment in the ethanol plant. We depend on our partners to operate ourethanol investments. Ourinvestments currently represent both majority and minority equity positions ordebt, and day-to-day operating control of each plant generally remains with thelocal farmers cooperative or investor group that has promoted the plant. Wemay not have the ability to directly modify the operations of the plants inresponse to changes in the business environment or in response to anydeficiencies in local operations of the 18plants. Inaddition, local plant operators, who also represent the primary suppliers ofcorn and other crops to the plants, may have interests, such as the price andsourcing of corn and other crops, that may differ from our interest, which isbased solely on the operating profit of the plant. The limitations on ourability to control day-to-day plant operations could adversely affect plantresults of operations. We may not successfully acquire or developadditional ethanol investments. The growth ofour ethanol business depends on our ability to identify and develop new ethanolinvestments. Our ethanol development strategy depends on referrals, and introductions,to new investment opportunities from industry participants, such as ethanolplant builders, financial institutions, marketing agents and others. We mustcontinue to maintain favorable relationships with these industry participants,and a material disruption in these sources of referrals would adversely affectour ability to expand our ethanol investments. Any expansionstrategy will depend on prevailing market conditions for the price of ethanoland the costs of corn and natural gas and the expectations of future marketconditions. The significant expansion of ethanol production capacity currentlyunderway in the United States could impede any expansion strategy. There isincreasing competition for suitable sites for ethanol plants. Even if suitablesites or opportunities are identified, we may not be able to secure theservices and products from contractors, engineering firms, construction firmsand equipment suppliers necessary to build or expand ethanol plants on a timelybasis or on acceptable economic terms. Construction costs associated withexpansion may increase to levels that would make a new plant too expensive tocomplete or unprofitable to operate. Additional financing may also be necessaryto implement any expansion strategy, which may not be accessible or availableon acceptable terms. We face significant competition in theethanol industry. We facesignificant competition for new ethanol investment opportunities. There aremany enterprises seeking to participate in the ethanol industry. Someenterprises provide financial support similar to our business model. Otherenterprises seek to acquire or develop plants which they will directly own andoperate. Many of our competitors are larger and have greater financialresources and name recognition than we do. We must compete for investmentopportunities based on our strategy of supporting and enhancing localdevelopment of ethanol plant opportunities. We may not be successful incompeting for investment opportunities based on our strategy. There is aconsolidation trend in the ethanol industry. As a result, firms are growing insize and scope. Larger firms offer efficiencies and economics of scale,resulting in lower costs of production. Absent significant growth anddiversification, our ethanol plants may not be able to operate profitably in amore competitive environment. No assurance can be given that our ethanol plantswill be able to compete successfully or that competition from larger companieswith greater financial resources will not have a materially adverse affect onthe results of our ethanol investments. The financial returns on our ethanolinvestments are highly dependent on commodity prices, which are subject tosignificant volatility and uncertainty, and the availability of supplies, soour results could fluctuate substantially. The financialreturns on our ethanol investments are substantially dependent on commodityprices, especially prices for corn or other feedstock, natural gas, ethanol andunleaded gasoline. As a result of the volatility of the prices for these items,the returns may fluctuate substantially and our investments could experienceperiods of declining prices for their products and increasing costs for theirraw materials, which could result in operating losses at our ethanol plants. Our returns onethanol investments are highly sensitive to grain prices.Corn or sorghum is the principal raw material our ethanol plants use or plan touse to produce ethanol and co-products. As a result, changes in 19the price ofcorn or sorghum can significantly affect their businesses. Rising corn orsorghum prices result in higher cost of ethanol and co-products. Becauseethanol competes with non-corn-based fuels, our ethanol plants generally willbe unable to pass along increased grain costs to their customers. At certainlevels, grain prices may make ethanol uneconomical to use in fuel markets. Overthe ten-year period from 1998 through 2007, corn prices (based on the ChicagoBoard of Trade, or CBOT, daily futures data) have ranged from a low of $1.75per bushel in 2000 to a high of $4.55 per bushel in 2007, with prices averaging$2.42 per bushel during this period. The ethanolindustry has experienced significantly higher corn prices beginning in thefourth quarter of 2006, which have remained high in 2007 at substantiallyhigher levels than in 2006. During 2007, CBOT corn prices ranged from a low of$3.10 per bushel to a high of $4.55 per bushel, with prices averaging $3.73 perbushel. At January 31, 2008, the CBOT price per bushel of corn for Marchdelivery was $5.01. If these high corn prices continue, they may have amaterial adverse effect on our ethanol plants business, results of operationsand financial position. The price ofcorn is influenced by weather conditions and other factors affecting cropyields, transportation costs, farmer planting decisions, exports, the value ofthe U.S. dollar and general economic, market and regulatory factors. Thesefactors include government policies and subsidies with respect to agricultureand international trade, and global and local demand and supply. Thesignificance and relative effect of these factors on the price of corn isdifficult to predict. Any event that tends to negatively affect the supply ofcorn, such as adverse weather or crop disease, could increase corn prices andpotentially harm the business of our ethanol plants. Increasing domesticethanol capacity could boost the demand for corn and result in increased cornprices. In 2006, corn bought by ethanol plants represented approximately 18% ofthe total corn supply for that year according to results reported by theNational Corn Growers Association, and this percentage is expected to increaseas additional ethanol capacity comes online, rising to more than 30% of thetotal corn supply by 2009/2010 according to the United States Department ofAgriculture. In addition, the price our ethanol plants pay for corn at afacility could increase if an additional ethanol production facility is builtin the same general vicinity. Our ethanolplants may also have difficulty, from time to time, in physically sourcing cornon economical terms due to supply shortages. Such a shortage could require ourethanol plants to suspend operations until corn is available at economical termswhich would have a material adverse effect on the financial returns on ourethanol investments. The spread betweenethanol and corn prices can vary significantly and may not return to recenthigh levels. Thegross margin at our ethanol plants depends principally on the spread betweenethanol and corn prices. During the five-year period from 2003 to 2007, ethanolprices (based on average U.S. ethanol rack prices from Bloomberg, L.P., orBloomberg) have ranged from a low of $1.11 per gallon to a high of $3.98 pergallon, averaging $1.90 per gallon during this period. For 2007, ethanol pricesaveraged $2.12 per gallon, reaching a high of $2.50 per gallon and a low of$1.69 per gallon (based on the daily closing prices from Bloomberg). In early2006, the spread between ethanol and corn prices was at historically highlevels, driven in large part by oil companies removing a competitive product,MTBE, from the fuel stream and replacing it with ethanol in a relatively shorttime period. However, this spread has fluctuated widely and narrowedsignificantly during 2007. Fluctuations are likely to continue to occur. Asustained narrow spread or any further reduction in the spread between ethanoland corn prices, whether as a result of sustained high or increased corn pricesor sustained low or decreased ethanol prices, would adversely affect theresults of operations at our ethanol plants. The market fornatural gas is subject to market conditions that create uncertainty in theprice and availability of the natural gas that our ethanol plants use in theirmanufacturing process. Our ethanol plants relyupon third parties for their supply of natural gas, which is consumed as fuelin the manufacture of ethanol. The prices for and availability of natural gasare subject to volatile market conditions. These market conditions often areaffected by factors beyond the ethanol plants control, such as weatherconditions, overall 20economicconditions and foreign and domestic governmental regulation and relations.Significant disruptions in the supply of natural gas could impair the ethanolplants ability to manufacture ethanol for their customers. Furthermore,increases in natural gas prices or changes in our natural gas costs relative tonatural gas costs paid by competitors may adversely affect results ofoperations and financial position at our ethanol plants. Fluctuations in theselling price and production costs of gasoline may reduce profit margins at ourethanol plants. Ethanol is marketed both as a fueladditive to reduce vehicle emissions from gasoline and as an octane enhancer toimprove the octane rating of gasoline with which it is blended. As a result,ethanol prices are influenced by the supply and demand for gasoline and ourethanol plants results of operations and financial position may be materiallyadversely affected if gasoline demand or price decreases. New plants under construction or decreases indemand for ethanol may result in excess production capacity in the ethanolindustry, which may cause the price of ethanol and/or distillers grains todecrease. According tothe Renewable Fuels Association, or RFA, domestic ethanol production capacityhas increased from 1.9 billion gallons per year in January 2001 toapproximately 7.9 billion gallons per year at January 2008. The RFA estimatesthat, as of January 2008, approximately 5.5 billion gallons per year ofadditional production capacity is under construction. The ethanol industry inthe U.S. now consists of more than 130 production facilities. Excess capacityin the ethanol industry would have an adverse effect on the results of ourethanol investments. In a manufacturing industry with excess capacity,producers have an incentive to manufacture additional products for so long asthe price exceeds the marginal cost of production (i.e., the cost of producingonly the next unit, without regard for interest, overhead or fixed costs). Thisincentive could result in the reduction of the market price of ethanol to alevel that is inadequate to generate sufficient cash flow to cover costs. Excesscapacity may also result from decreases in the demand for ethanol, which couldresult from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, regulatorydevelopments and reduced U.S. gasoline consumption. Reduced gasolineconsumption could occur as a result of increased prices for gasoline or crudeoil, which could cause businesses and consumers to reduce driving or acquirevehicles with more favorable gasoline mileage or acquire hybrid vehicles. Thereis some evidence that this has occurred in the recent past as U.S. gasolineprices have increased. In addition,because ethanol production produces distillers grains as a co-product,increased ethanol production will also lead to increased supplies of distillersgrains. An increase in the supply of distillers grains, without correspondingincreases in demand, could lead to lower prices or an inability to sell ourethanol plants distillers grains production. A decline in the price ofdistillers grains or the distillers grains market generally could have amaterial adverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments. Our ethanol plants may be adversely affectedby technological advances and efforts to anticipate and employ suchtechnological advances may prove unsuccessful. Thedevelopment and implementation of new technologies may result in a significantreduction in the costs of ethanol production. For instance, any technologicaladvances in the efficiency or cost to produce ethanol from inexpensive,cellulosic sources such as wheat, oat or barley straw could have an adverseeffect on our ethanol plants, because those facilities are designed to produceethanol from corn, which is, by comparison, a raw material with other highvalue uses. We cannot predict when new technologies may become available, therate of acceptance of new technologies by competitors or the costs associatedwith new technologies. In addition, advances in the development of alternativesto ethanol could significantly reduce demand for or eliminate the need forethanol. Any advancesin technology which require significant unanticipated capital expenditures toremain competitive or which reduce demand or prices for ethanol would have amaterial adverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments. 21In addition,alternative fuels, additives and oxygenates are continually under development.Alternative fuel additives that can replace ethanol may be developed, which maydecrease the demand for ethanol. It is also possible that technological advancesin engine and exhaust system design and performance could reduce the use ofoxygenates, which would lower the demand for ethanol, and the results of ourethanol investments may be materially adversely affected. The U.S. ethanol industry is highly dependentupon a myriad of federal and state legislation and regulation and any changesin legislation or regulation could materially and adversely affect our resultsof operations and financial position. The elimination orsignificant reduction in the blenders credit could have a material adverseeffect on the results of our ethanol investments.The cost of production of ethanol is made significantly more competitive withregular gasoline by federal tax incentives. The federal excise tax incentiveprogram currently allows gasoline distributors who blend ethanol with gasolineto receive a federal excise tax rate reduction for each blended gallon theysell. If the fuel is blended with 10% ethanol, the refiner/marketer pays $0.051per gallon less tax, which equates to an incentive of $0.51 per gallon ofethanol. The $0.51 per gallon incentive for ethanol is scheduled to be reducedto $0.46 per gallon in 2009 and to expire in 2010. The blenders credits couldbe eliminated or reduced at any time through an act of Congress and may not berenewed in 2010 or may be renewed on different terms. In addition, theblenders credits, as well as other federal and state programs benefitingethanol (such as tariffs), generally are subject to U.S. government obligationsunder international trade agreements, including those under the World TradeOrganization Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, and might bethe subject of challenges thereunder, in whole or in part. Ethanol can beimported into the U.S. duty-free from some countries, which may undermine theethanol industry in the U.S. Imported ethanol isgenerally subject to a $0.54 per gallon tariff that was designed to offset the$0.51 per gallon ethanol incentive that is available under the federal excisetax incentive program for refineries that blend ethanol in their fuel. Aspecial exemption from the tariff exists for ethanol imported from 24 countriesin Central America and the Caribbean Islands, which is limited to a total of 7%of U.S. production per year. Imports from the exempted countries may increaseas a result of new plants under development. Since production costs for ethanolin these countries are estimated to be significantly less than what they are inthe U.S., the duty-free import of ethanol through the countries exempted fromthe tariff may negatively affect the demand for domestic ethanol and the priceat which our ethanol plants sell ethanol. Although the $0.54 per gallon tariffhas been extended through December 31, 2008, bills were previously introducedin both the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate to repeal the tariff.We do not know the extent to which the volume of imports would increase or theeffect on U.S. prices for ethanol if the tariff is not renewed beyond itscurrent expiration. Any changes in the tariff or exemption from the tariffcould have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments.In addition, the North America Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, which enteredinto force on January 1, 1994, allows Canada and Mexico to export ethanol tothe United States duty-free or at a reduced rate. Canada is exempt from dutyunder the current NAFTA guidelines, while Mexicos duty rate is $0.10 pergallon. The effect of therenewable fuel standard (RFS) program in the Energy Independence and SecurityAct signed into law on December 19, 2007 (the 2007 Act) is uncertain.The mandated minimum level of use of renewable fuels in the RFS under the 2007Act increased to 9 billion gallons per year in 2008 (from 5.4 billion gallonsunder the RFS enacted in 2005), further increasing to 36 billion gallons peryear in 2022. The 2007 Act also requires the increased use of advancedbiofuels, which are alternative biofuels produced without using corn starchsuch as cellulosic ethanol and biomass-based diesel, with 21 billion gallons ofthe mandated 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel required to come fromadvanced biofuels by 2022. Required RFS volumes for both general and advancedrenewable fuels in years to follow 2022 will be determined by a governmentaladministrator, in coordination with the U.S. Department of Energy and U.S.Department of Agriculture. Increased competition from other types of biofuelscould have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments.22The RFSprogram and the 2007 Act also include provisions allowing credits to begranted to fuel producers who blend in their fuel more than the requiredpercentage of renewable fuels in a given year. These credits may be used insubsequent years to satisfy RFS production percentage and volume standards andmay be traded to other parties. The accumulation of excess credits couldfurther reduce the impact of the RFS mandate schedule and result in a lowerethanol price or could result in greater fluctuations in demand for ethanolfrom year to year, both of which could have a material adverse effect on theresults of our ethanol investments. Waivers of the RFSminimum levels of renewable fuels included in gasoline could have a materialadverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments.Under the RFS as passed as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the U.S.Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the Secretary ofAgriculture and the Secretary of Energy, may waive the renewable fuels mandatewith respect to one or more states if the Administrator of the U.S.Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, determines upon the petition of one ormore states that implementing the requirements would severely harm the economyor the environment of a state, a region or the U.S., or that there isinadequate supply to meet the requirement. In addition, the 2007 Act allows anyother person subject to the requirements of the RFS or the EPA Administrator tofile a petition for such a waiver. Any waiver of the RFS with respect to one ormore states could adversely offset demand for ethanol and could have a materialadverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments. Various studies have criticized theefficiency of ethanol, in general, and corn-based ethanol in particular, whichcould lead to the reduction or repeal of incentives and tariffs that promotethe use and domestic production of ethanol or otherwise negatively impactpublic perception and acceptance of ethanol as an alternative fuel. Although manytrade groups, academics and governmental agencies have supported ethanol as afuel additive that promotes a cleaner environment, others have criticizedethanol production as consuming considerably more energy and emitting more greenhousegases than other biofuels and as potentially depleting water resources. Otherstudies have suggested that corn-based ethanol is less efficient than ethanolproduced from switchgrass or wheat grain and that it negatively impactsconsumers by causing prices for dairy, meat and other foodstuffs from livestockthat consume corn to increase. If these views gain acceptance, support forexisting measures promoting use and domestic production of corn-based ethanolcould decline, leading to reduction or repeal of these measures. These viewscould also negatively impact public perception of the ethanol industry andacceptance of ethanol as an alternative fuel. Changes in interest rates could have amaterial adverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments. LevellandHockley, One Earth and Patriot all have forward interest rate swaps at January31, 2008. During fiscal year 2007, we recognized an unrealized loss on theseswaps of approximately $3.5 million. Further reductions in interest rates couldreduce the fair market value of the interest rate swaps, requiring us to recordadditional expense. Such expense could be material.   "
3,REX,REX AMERICAN RESOURCES CORP,2007-04-16,"Risk Factors
 We encourage you to carefully consider the risks described below and other information contained in this report when considering an investment decision in REX common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties not presentlyknown to management, or that management currently deems immaterial, may also impair our business operations. Any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur. If one or more of these events do occur, our results of operations,financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In this instance, the trading price of REX stock could decline, and investors might lose all or part of their investment. Risks Related to our Retail Business We face significant competition from other retailers many of whom have greater financial resources. This could result in a decline of our sales and profitability. 14We face significant competition from a diverse group of retailers.  Our competitors include national and regional large format merchandisers and superstores such as Best Buy Co., Inc., Lowes Corporation, Home Depot,Inc. and Circuit City Stores, Inc., other specialty electronics retailers including RadioShack Corporation, department and discount stores such as Sears, Roebuck and Co. and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., furniture stores, warehouse clubs, home improvementretailers and Internet and store-based retailers who sell consumer electronics and home appliance products online. We also compete with small chains and specialty single-store operators in some markets, as well as Sears dealer-operated units.Some of our competitors have greater financial resources than us, which may increase their ability to purchase inventory at a lower cost, better withstand economic downturns or engage in aggressive price competition. We expect competition within the consumer electronics/appliance retailing industry to increase.  National merchandisers continue to expand their geographic markets and enter markets traditionally served by us. In the eventthat competitors enter markets we serve, we may experience pricing pressures, reduced gross margins and declines in comparable store sales. A decline in economic conditions could lead to reduced consumer demand for the products we sell. Demand for consumer electronics and home appliance products is dependent upon various economic factors outside of our control. These factors include: general economic conditions;consumer confidence;consumer spending patterns and preferences; andnew housing starts.A slowdown in the national or regional economies or an uncertain economic outlook could adversely affect discretionary consumer spending habits andnegatively impact our sales and operating results. If new products are not introduced or consumers do not accept new products, our sales may decline. We rely upon the periodic introduction of new products to help stimulate consumer demand. The lack of new products could reduce consumer interest and lower our sales. In addition, many products which incorporate the newest technologies, such as high definition television, are subject to technological and pricing limitations and may not achieve widespread or rapid consumer acceptance inthe markets we serve.  If these new products do not meet with widespread or rapid market acceptance, our results of operations may be impaired. Furthermore, the introduction or expected introduction of new products may depress sales of existing products and technologies. Government mandates for such areas as high definition television tuners can increase production costsand lead to higher retail prices that could reduce product acceptance.  Other mandates include the Department of Energy compliance mandates for major appliances that will be in effect in 2007. This could also lead to higher retail prices and aslowdown in overall product demand. If we do not adequately anticipate and respond to changing consumer demand and preferences, our results of operations may be impaired. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer demand and preferences regarding consumer electronics and home appliances.  Our failure to adequately anticipateand respond to these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, 15results of operation and financial condition either from lost sales or lower margins due to the need to mark down excess inventory. Our opportunistic product buying strategy could negatively impact our sales and gross margins. When available, we may purchase large quantities of merchandise on an opportunistic or when-available basis at favorable prices. Our inability to find suitable opportunistic product buying opportunities could negativelyimpact our sales and gross margins.  As manufacturers move to more market-driven, supply chain management strategies, the opportunities for opportunistic purchases may decline. Products purchased on an opportunistic basis generally are held in inventory longer than our other products. This can result in increased inventory levels and lower inventory turnover, which increase our working capitalrequirements and inventory carrying costs. Increased inventory levels and lower turnover rates also increase the risk of inventory mark-downs. The introduction of digitally-based display products such as plasma, LCD and other micro display productshas shortened product life cycles and introduced a higher degree of risk for opportunistic buying.  Given the rate of change of technology and price levels, opportunity costs for purchasing in large quantities can be offset by the obsolescence riskof holding merchandise that may have to be deeply discounted to consumers. Fluctuations in our comparable store sales may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. ""Comparable store sales"" is a term we use to compare the year over year sales performance of our stores. We consider a store to be comparable after it has been open six full fiscal quarters. A number of factors have historically affected and will continue to affect our comparable store sales, including the following: competition;national and regional economic conditions;consumer trends;new product introductions;weather conditions which can impact store traffic as well as sales of seasonal products such as air conditioners;changes in our product mix and availability of products from key vendors;duration of the holiday selling season;timing of promotional events; andattracting and retaining qualified sales personnel.Comparable store sales are often followed closely by the investment community and significant fluctuations in these results could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. Our quarterly operating results are subject to seasonality.  Our profitability would be adversely affected by lower than expected fourth quarter results. Our retail business is seasonal. Our net retail sales and net income historically have been highest in our fourth fiscal quarter, which includes theChristmas selling season. The fourth quarter accounted for approximately 30% and 33% of our net sales and revenue, and 31% and 23% of our net income in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our annual financial results would be adversely impacted ifour sales were to fall substantially below what we normally expect during this period. 16We depend on our suppliers for products and our business could be adversely affected if we do not maintain relationships with our key vendors. Our success depends to a significant degree upon our suppliers of consumer electronics and home appliance products. We do not have any long-term supply agreements or exclusive arrangements with vendors. We typically ordermerchandise by issuing individual purchase orders to vendors. We rely significantly on a few suppliers. Our nine largest suppliers accounted for approximately 86% of our purchases during fiscal 2006, with three suppliers representing approximately45% of our inventory purchases in fiscal 2006. The loss of any of these key vendors, our failure to establish and maintain relationships with our vendors, or any prolonged disruptions in product supply, could have a material adverse impact on ourbusiness. We may incur higher costs or decreased sales and gross margins because we purchase imported products. A significant portion of our inventory is manufactured outside the United States.  Changes in trade regulations, currency fluctuations or other factors may increase the cost of items manufactured outside the United Statesor create shortages of those items. We purchase all of our products in U.S. dollars. Significant reductions in the cost of such items in U.S. dollars may cause a significant reduction in retail price levels of those products, which could adverselyaffect our sales and gross margins. The loss of the services of our Chief Executive Officer or our other key employees could jeopardize our ability to maintain our competitive position. We believe that our success depends on the continued service of our key executive management personnel. Loss of the services of Stuart Rose, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, or other key employees could jeopardizeour ability to maintain our competitive position in the industry.Risks Related to our Synthetic Fuel Investments Income and tax credits from our investments in facilities producing synthetic fuel have contributed significantly to our operating and net income in past years but will not continue after December 31, 2007.In fiscal 1998, we invested in two limited partnerships, Colona Synfuel Limited Partnership, L.L.L.P. (Colona) and Somerset Synfuel, L.P. (Somerset), which own facilities producing synthetic fuel.  In fiscal 2002, wepurchased a plant located in Gillette, Wyoming (Gillette) designed and constructed for the production of synthetic fuel. The entities earn federal income tax credits under Section 29/45K of the Internal Revenue Code based on the quantity and contentof synthetic fuel production and sales. We sold our interest in the Colona partnership in three separate sale transactions and expect to receive cash payments from the sales on a quarterly basis through 2007, subject to production levels. We reported income fromthe sales of approximately $5.3 million and $22.8 million in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively, which accounted for approximately 33% and 63% of our income from continuing operations before income taxes in those years. The loss of thisincome will significantly reduce our net income. We also sold our interest in the limited liability company that owned the Gillette facility and received $2.75 million at the time of the sale in March 2004 along with a secured contingent payment note that couldprovide additional investment income to us. This plant was dismantled and relocated.  The facility resumed commercial operations in the second quarter of 2005 and we received an additional $3.5 million. We are also eligible to receive $1.50per ton of ""qualified production"" fuel produced by the facility and sold through 2007. The plant was subsequently sold and during the third quarter of fiscal 2006, we modified our agreement with 17the owners and operators of the synthetic fuel facility. Based on the terms of the modified agreement, we currently are not able to determine the likelihood and timing of collecting payments related to production occurringafter September 30, 2006. Thus, we cannot currently determine the timing of income recognition, if any, related to production occurring subsequent to September 30, 2006. We reported income from the sale of approximately $1.1 million and $6.1million in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. The loss of this income will significantly reduce our net income. Effective October 1, 2005, we sold our entire ownership interest in the Somerset partnership. We received $1.2 million, net of commissions, at closing along with a secured contingent payment note that could provideadditional investment income. We expect to receive quarterly payments through 2007 equal to 80% of the Section 29/45K tax credits attributable to the ownership interest sold, subject to production levels.  We reported income from the sale ofapproximately $4.4 million and $1.6 million in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. The loss of this income will significantly reduce our net income. The current Section 29/45K tax credit program expires on December 31, 2007. If not renewed by Congress, we will not receive income related to Section 29/45K tax credits for the production and sale of synthetic fuel afterthat date. We face synthetic fuel risks as future IRS audits may result in the disallowance of previously recognized tax credits. We have been allocated in total approximately $48 million in Section 29/45K credits. Should the tax credits be denied on any future audit and we fail to prevail through the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or the legalprocess, there could be a significant tax liability owed for previously taken tax credits with a significant adverse impact on earnings and cash flows.The production and sale of synthetic fuel qualifies for Section 29/45K tax credits if certain requirements are satisfied, including a requirement that the synthetic fuel differs significantly in chemical composition fromthe coal used to produce the synthetic fuel and that the fuel was produced from a facility placed in service before July 1, 1998.We face synthetic fuel risks associated with crude oil prices as such our income could decrease significantly. Recent increases in the price of oil could limit the amount of Section 29/45K tax credits or eliminate them altogether following fiscal 2006.  Section 29/45K provides that if the average wellhead price per barrel forunregulated domestic crude oil for the year (the ""Annual Average Price"") exceeds a certain threshold value (the ""Threshold Price""), the Section 29/45K tax credits are subject to phase out.  For calendar year 2006, the Threshold Price was $56.71per barrel and the Phase Out Price was $71.19 per barrel. The Threshold Price and the Phase Out Price are adjusted annually as a result of inflation. We cannot determine, with absolute certainty, the Annual Average Price for 2007. Therefore, wecannot determine whether the price of oil will have a material effect on our synthetic fuel income after fiscal 2006.  However, if during fiscal 2007 oil prices remain at historically high levels or increase, our synthetic fuel income may beadversely affected. Based upon the price of oil to date, we estimate the tax credits and related income, for calendar year 2007 would not be subject to phase out as of January 31, 2007. Because synthetic fuel is not economical to produce absent theassociated tax credits, and we have no control or decision involvement with production levels, we cannot determine the impact of possible production reduction or elimination on our financial results. We may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets. We have approximately $35.4 million of deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated financial statements. Should future results of operations or other factors cause us to determine that it is unlikely that we willgenerate 18sufficient taxable income to fully utilize our deferred tax assets, we would then be required to establish a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets by increasing our income tax expense in the amount of taxbenefit we do not expect to realize. This would reduce our net income and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We may realize capital losses related to our sales of synthetic fuel ownership interests. We have, for income tax purposes, recognized capital gain in the year of sale for certain sales of our ownership interests in synthetic fuel entities.  Should we, in subsequent years, realize a capital loss as a result oflower synthetic fuel production, for income tax purposes, we may be required to carry the loss back to prior years. This could result in the write down of previously used Section 29/45K tax credits. This would reduce our net income and could have amaterial adverse effect on our results of operations. Risks Related to our Alternative Energy Business Our ethanol investments are subject to the risks of a development stage business which could adversely affect the returns on our ethanol investments and our results of operations. We do not have an established record for investing in the ethanol industry.  We entered into our first agreement to invest in an ethanol plant in November 2005. At January 31, 2007, we have invested in four entities.  Threeentities have begun construction of ethanol production facilities and one is expanding its current ethanol production facilities. Our ethanol investments have been managed by our Chief Executive Officer, our Vice President and our Chief FinancialOfficer. We do not otherwise have a dedicated ethanol development staff. As a consequence, our ethanol investments are subject to all of the risks associated with a development stage company, including an unproven business model, a lack of operatinghistory and an undeveloped operating structure. These development stage risks could result in our making investments in ethanol plants that perform substantially below our expectations, which would adversely affect our results of operations andfinancial condition. We invest in new construction of ethanol plants and significant expansion of existing plants.  As a result, we face significant project development risks that may adversely affect our investment returns. In each of our investments, we are investing in the new construction of a plant or a significant expansion of an existing plant. As a result, our investments face risks of construction delays and cost over-runs that coulddelay or reduce our investment returns.  In addition, the new plants are development-stage operations that must obtain necessary permits and complete arrangements for transportation, natural gas and marketing of the ethanol before production canbegin. The failure to obtain any of these necessary elements in a timely manner or on commercially acceptable terms could adversely affect the profitability of each plant.  Once the new plants or expansions begin production, they face uncertaintiesof whether they will perform to specifications and whether they will achieve anticipated operating results. We depend on our partners to operate our ethanol investments. We may not directly operate the ethanol plants in which we invest.  Our investments currently represent minority equity positions or debt, and day-to-day operating control of each plant remains with the local farmerscooperative or group that has promoted the plant. We may not have the ability to directly modify the operations of each plant in response to changes in the business environment or in response to any deficiencies in local operations of the plants. Inaddition, local plant operators, who also represent the primary suppliers of corn and other crops to the plants, may have interests, such as the price and sourcing of corn, that may differ from our interest, which is based solely on the operatingprofit of the plant. The limitations on our ability to control day-to-day plant operations could adversely affect plant results of operations. 19We may not successfully acquire or develop additional ethanol investments. The growth of our ethanol business depends on our ability to identify and develop new ethanol investments. Our ethanol development strategy depends on referrals, and introductions, to new investment opportunities fromindustry participants, such as ethanol plant builders, marketing agents and others. We must continue to maintain favorable relationships with these industry participants, and a material disruption in these sources of referrals would adversely affectour ability to expand our ethanol investments.  In addition, we face significant competition for new ethanol investment opportunities.  There are many enterprises seeking to participate in the ethanol industry.  Some enterprises, such as Andersons,Inc., provide financial support similar to our business model. Other enterprises seek to acquire or develop plants which they will directly own and operate. As a consequence, there is increasing competition for suitable sites for new or expandedplants.  Many of our competitors for these sites are larger and have greater financial resources and name recognition than we do. We must compete for investment opportunities based on our strategy of supporting and enhancing local development ofethanol plant opportunities. We may not be successful in competing for investment opportunities based on our strategy. We face risks that our funding commitments will not become investments positions in ethanol plants. We have structured our investments in ethanol plants as agreements to purchase secured notes or equity in the limited liability companies that are developing each plant. Our obligation to fund the investment commitment issubject to a number of conditions, including completing an equity financing to a specified level, obtaining senior debt financing and executing a plant construction agreement with a specified builder.  We will not begin to realize any returns onethanol investments until these conditions to funding are satisfied. Any delay or failure in satisfying the funding conditions would adversely affect the development of our ethanol investments. The financial returns on our ethanol investments are highly dependent on commodity prices, which are subject to significant volatility and uncertainty, and the availability of supplies, so our results could fluctuatesubstantially. The financial returns on our ethanol investments are substantially dependent on commodity prices, especially prices for corn, natural gas, ethanol and unleaded gasoline. As a result of the volatility of the prices for theseitems, these returns may fluctuate substantially and our investments could experience periods of declining prices for their products and increasing costs for their raw materials, which could result in operating losses at our ethanol plants.Our returns on ethanol investments are highly sensitive to corn prices.  The principal raw material our ethanol plants use to produceethanol and co-products is corn. As a result, changes in the price of corn can significantly affect their businesses. In general, rising corn prices produce lower profit margins. Because ethanol competes with non-corn-based fuels, our ethanol plantsgenerally will be unable to pass along increase corn costs to their customers. At certain levels, corn prices may make ethanol uneconomical to use in fuel markets. Over the ten-year period from 1997 through 2006, corn prices (based on the ChicagoBoard of Trade, or CBOT, daily futures data) have ranged from a low of $1.75 per bushel in 2000 to a high of $3.90 per bushel in 2006 with prices averaging $2.32 per bushel during this period. At January 31, 2007, the CBOT price perbushel of corn was $4.04. The price of corn is influenced by weather conditions and other factors affecting crop yields, farmer planting decisions and general economic, market and regulatory factors. These factors include government policies andsubsidies with respect to agriculture and international trade, and global and local demand and supply. The significance and relative effect of these factors on the price of corn is difficult to predict. Any event that tends to negatively affect thesupply of corn, such as adverse weather or crop disease, could increase corn prices and potentially harm the business of our ethanol plants. In addition, our ethanol plants may also have difficulty, from time to time, in physically sourcing corn oneconomical terms due to supply shortages. Such a shortage could require our ethanol plants to suspend operations until corn is available at economical terms 20which would have a material adverse effect on the financial returns on our ethanol investments. The price the ethanol plants pay for corn at a facility could increase if an additional ethanol production facility is built inthe same vicinity. The spread between ethanol and corn prices can vary significantly and we do not expect the spread to remain at recent high levels. Thegross margin at our ethanol plants depends principally on the spread between ethanol and corn prices. During the five-year period from 2002 to 2006, ethanol prices (based on average U.S. ethanol rack prices from Bloomberg, L.P., or Bloomberg) haveranged from a low of $0.94 per gallon to a high of $3.98 per gallon, averaging $1.70 per gallon during this period. In recent periods, the spread between ethanol and corn prices has been at historically high levels, driven in large partby high oil prices and historically low corn prices. However, this spread has fluctuated widely and fluctuations are likely to continue to occur. Any reduction in the spread between ethanol and corn prices, whether as a result of an increase in cornprices or a reduction in ethanol prices, would adversely affect the results of operations at our ethanol plants. The market for natural gas is subject to market conditions that create uncertainty in the price and availability of the natural gas that our ethanol plants use in their manufacturing process. Our ethanol plants rely upon third parties for their supply of natural gas, which is consumed in the manufacture of ethanol. The prices for and availability of natural gas are subject tovolatile market conditions.  These market conditions often are affected by the factors beyond the ethanol plants control such as higher prices resulting from colder than average weather conditions and overall economic conditions. Significantdisruptions in the supply of natural gas could impair the ethanol plants ability to manufacture ethanol for their customers. Furthermore, increases in natural gas prices or changes in our natural gas costs relative to natural gas costs paid bycompetitors may adversely affect results of operations and financial position at our ethanol plants.Fluctuations in the selling price and production costs of gasoline may reduce profit margins at our ethanol plants.  Ethanol is marketedboth as a fuel additive to reduce vehicle emissions from gasoline and as an octane enhancer to improve the octane rating of gasoline with which it is blended. As a result, ethanol prices are influenced by the supply and demand for gasoline and ourresults of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected if gasoline demand or price decreases.If the expected increase in ethanol demand does not occur, or if the demand for ethanol otherwise decreases, there may be excess capacity in the ethanol industry. Domestic capacity has increased steadily from 1.7 billion gallons per year in January 1999 to 5.5 billion gallons per year at January 2007. In addition, there is a significant amount of capacity being added to the industry.According to the RFA, as of January 2007 approximately 5.6 billion gallons per year of production capacity was under construction.  This capacity is being added to address anticipated increased demand. However, demand for ethanol may not increase asquickly as expected or to a level that exceeds supply, or at all. If the ethanol industry has excess capacity and such excess capacity results in a fall in prices, it will have an adverse impact on the results of operations, cash flows and financialcondition of our ethanol plants. Excess capacity may result from the increases in capacity coupled with insufficient demand. Demand could be impaired due to a number of factors including regulatory developments and reduced United States gasolineconsumption. Reduced gasoline consumption could occur as a result of increased gasoline or oil prices. For example, price increases could cause businesses and consumers to reduce driving or acquire vehicles with more favorable gasoline mileage.There is some evidence that this has occurred in the recent past as United States gasoline prices have increased. The U.S. ethanol industry is highly dependent upon a myriad of federal and state legislation and regulation and any changes in legislation or regulation could materially and adversely affect our results of operations andfinancial position. The elimination or significant reduction in the blenders credit could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments. The cost of production ofethanol is made significantly more competitive 21with regular gasoline by federal tax incentives.  Before January 1, 2005, the federal excise tax incentive program allowed gasoline distributors who blended ethanol with gasoline to receive a federal excise tax ratereduction for each blended gallon they sold. If the fuel was blended with 10% ethanol, the refiner/marketer paid $0.054 per gallon less tax, which equated to an incentive of $0.54 per gallon of ethanol. The $0.54 per gallon incentive forethanol was reduced to $0.51 per gallon in 2005 and is scheduled to expire (unless extended) in 2010. The blenders credits may not be renewed in 2010 or may be renewed on different terms. In addition, the blenders credits, as well asother federal and state programs benefiting ethanol (such as tariffs), generally are subject to U.S. government obligations under international trade agreements, including those under the World Trade Organization Agreement on Subsidies andCountervailing Measures, and might be the subject of challenges thereunder, in whole or in part. The elimination or significant reduction in the blenders credit or other programs benefiting ethanol may have a material adverse effect on theresults of our ethanol investments. Ethanol can be imported into the U.S. duty-free from some countries which may undermine the ethanol industry in the U.S.  Importedethanol is generally subject to a $0.54 per gallon tariff that was designed to offset the $0.51 per gallon ethanol incentive available under the federal excise tax incentive program for refineries that blend ethanol in their fuel. A specialexemption from the tariff exists for the ethanol imported from 24 countries in Central America and the Caribbean Islands, which is limited to a total of 7% of U.S. production per year.  Imports from the exempted countries may increase as a result ofnew plants under development. Since production costs for ethanol in these countries are estimated to be significantly less than what they are in the U.S., the duty-free import of ethanol through the countries exempted from the tariff may negativelyaffect the demand for domestic ethanol and the price at which our ethanol plants sell their ethanol. In May 2006, bills were introduced in both the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate to repeal the $0.54 per gallon tariff. We do notknow the extent to which the volume of imports would increase or the effect on U.S. prices for ethanol if this proposed legislation is enacted or if the tariff is not renewed beyond its current expiration in December 2008. Any changes in the tariffor exemption from the tariff could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments. In addition, the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, which entered into force on January 1, 1994, allows Canada and Mexico toexport ethanol to the United States duty-free or at a reduced rate. Canada is exempt from duty under the current NAFTA guidelines, while Mexicos duty rate is $0.10 per gallon. The effect of the RFS in the Energy Policy Act is uncertain.  The use of fuel oxygenates, including ethanol, was mandated throughregulation, and much of the forecasted growth in demand for ethanol was expected to result from additional mandated use of oxygenates. Most of this growth was projected to occur in the next few years as the remaining markets switch from MTBE toethanol. The Energy Policy Act, however, eliminated the mandated use of oxygenates and established minimum annual nationwide levels of renewable fuels to be included in gasoline.  The annual requirement grows to 7.5 billion gallons by 2012. Because biodiesel and other renewable fuels in addition to ethanol are counted toward the minimum usage requirements of the renewable fuel standard or RFS, the elimination of the oxygenate requirement for reformulated gasoline may result in adecline in ethanol consumption, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments. The legislation also included provisions for trading of credits for use of renewable fuels and authorized potentialreductions in the RFS minimum by action of a governmental administrator.  As the rules for implementation of the RFS and the energy bill are under development, the impact of legislation is still uncertain. Waivers of the RFS minimum levels of renewable fuels included in gasoline could have a material adverse affect on the results of our ethanol investments.  Under the Energy Policy Act, the U.S. Department of Energy, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Energy, may waive the renewable fuels mandate with respect to one or more states if theAdministrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or U.S. EPA, determines that implementing the requirements would severely harm the economy or the environment of a state, a region or the U.S., or that there is inadequate supply to meet therequirement. Any waiver of the RFS with respect to one or more states would adversely offset demand for ethanol and could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol investments. 22"

These factorsinclude:    identifying new geographic  markets in which we can successfully compete;    identifying and acquiring  or leasing suitable new store sites at an acceptable cost;    obtaining governmental and  other third-party consents, permits and licenses needed to operate new  stores;    securing favorable  economic terms for newspaper, television and radio advertising;    hiring, promoting and  training qualified personnel, including new store managers;    integrating new stores  into our existing operations;    adapting our existing  information systems and distribution infrastructure to a growing number of  stores; and    having adequate financial  resources available to us.11To execute a store expansionprogram, we may need to expend significant effort and additional managerial andfinancial resources to ensure the continuing adequacy of our financialcontrols, operating procedures, information systems, product purchasing anddistribution systems and employee training programs.A decline in economic conditions could lead to reducedconsumer demand for the products we sell.Demandfor consumer electronics and home appliance products is dependent upon variouseconomic factors outside of our control. These factors include:    general economic  conditions;    consumer confidence;    consumer spending patterns  and preferences; and    new housing starts.Aslowdown in the national or regional economies or an uncertain economic outlookcould adversely affect discretionary consumer spending habits and negatively impact our sales and operatingresults.If new products are not introduced or consumers do not acceptnew products, our sales may decline.Werely upon the periodic introduction of new products to help stimulate consumerdemand. The lack of new products could reduce consumer interest and lower oursales.Inaddition, many products which incorporate the newest technologies, such as highdefinition television, are subject to technological and pricing limitations andmay not achieve widespread or rapid consumer acceptance in the markets weserve. If these new products do not meet with widespread or rapid marketacceptance, our results of operations may be impaired.Furthermore,the introduction or expected introduction of new products may depress sales ofexisting products and technologies. Government mandates for such areas as highdefinition TV tuners can increase production costs and lead to higher retailprices that could reduce product acceptance. Other mandates include the Departmentof Energy compliance mandates for major appliances that will be in effect in2007. This could also lead to higher retail prices and a slowdown in overallproduct demand.If we do not adequately anticipate and respond to changingconsumer demand and preferences, our results of operations may be impaired.Oursuccess depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timelymanner to changing consumer demand and preferences regarding consumerelectronics and home appliances. Our failure to adequately anticipate andrespond to these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business,results of operation and financial condition either from lost sales or lowermargins due to the need to mark down excess inventory.12Our opportunistic product buying strategy could negativelyimpact our sales and gross margins.Whenavailable, we may purchase large quantities of merchandise on an opportunisticor when-available basis at favorable prices. Our inability to find suitableopportunistic product buying opportunities could negatively impact our salesand gross margins. As manufacturers move to more market-driven, supply chainmanagement strategies, the opportunities for opportunistic purchases maydecline.Productspurchased on an opportunistic basis generally are held in inventory longer thanour other products. This can result in increased inventory levels and lowerinventory turnover, which increase our working capital requirements andinventory carrying costs. Increased inventory levels and lower turnover ratesalso increase the risk of inventory mark-downs. The introduction ofdigitally-based display products such as plasma, LCD and other micro displayproducts has shortened product life cycles and introduced a higher degree ofrisk for opportunistic buying. Given the rate of change of technology and pricelevels, opportunity costs for purchasing in large quantities can be offset bythe obsolescence risk of holding merchandise that may have to be deeplydiscounted to consumers.Income and tax credits from our investments in facilitiesproducing synthetic fuel have contributed significantly to our operating andnet income in past years but will not continue after December 31, 2007.In fiscal 1998, we investedin two limited partnerships, Colona Synfuel Limited Partnership, L.L.L.P.(Colona) and Somerset Synfuel, L.P. (Somerset), which own facilities producingsynthetic fuel. In fiscal 2002, we purchased a plant located in Gillette,Wyoming (Gillette) designed and constructed for the production of syntheticfuel. The entities earn federal income tax credits under Section 29/45K of theInternal Revenue Code based on the quantity and content of synthetic fuelproduction and sales.We sold our interest in theColona partnership in three separate sale transactions and expect to receivecash payments from the sales on a quarterly basis through 2007, subject toproduction levels. We reported income from the sales of approximately $22.8million and $18.1 million in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively, whichaccounted for approximately 63% and 84% of our income from continuingoperations before income taxes in those years. The loss of this income wouldsignificantly reduce our net income.We also sold our interest inthe limited liability company that owned the Gillette facility and received$2.75 million at the time of the sale in March 2004 along with a securedcontingent payment note that could provide additional investment income to us.The facility resumed commercial operations in the second quarter of 2005 and wereceived an additional $3.5 million. We are also eligible to receive $1.50 perton of qualified production fuel produced by the facility and sold through2007. We reported income from the sale of approximately $6.1 million in fiscal2005. The loss of this income would significantly reduce our net income.Effective October 1, 2005, we sold our entire ownership interest  in the Somerset partnership. We received $1.2 million, net of commissions, at  closing along with a secured contingent payment note that could provide additional  investment income. We expect to receive quarterly payments through 2007 equal  to 80% of the Section 29/45K tax credits attributable to the ownership interest  sold, subject to production levels. We reported income from the sale of approximately  $1.6 million in fiscal 2005. The loss of this income would significantly reduce  our net income.The current Section 29/45Ktax credit program expires on December 31, 2007. If not renewed by Congress, wewill not receive income related to Section 29/45K tax credits for theproduction and sale of synthetic fuel after that date.13The Permanent Subcommitteeon Investigations of the U.S. Senates Committee on Government Affairsinitiated an investigation on the subject of Section 29/45K tax credits inOctober 2003. We cannot determine the outcome of this matter or its impact onthe Section 29/45K tax credit program.We face synthetic fuel risks asfuture IRS audits may result in the disallowance of previously recognized taxcredits.We have been allocated intotal approximately $47.7 million in Section 29/45K credits. Should the taxcredits be denied on any future audit and we fail to prevail through theInternal Revenue Service (IRS) or the legal process, there could be asignificant tax liability owed for previously taken tax credits with asignificant adverse impact on earnings and cash flows. The production and sale of synthetic fuel qualifies for Section  29/45K tax credits if certain requirements are satisfied, including a requirement  that the synthetic fuel differs significantly in chemical composition from the  coal used to produce the synthetic fuel and that the fuel was produced from  a facility placed in service before July 1, 1998. We face synthetic fuel risksassociated with crude oil prices as our income could decrease significantly.Recent increases in the price of oil could limit the amount of  Section 29/45K tax credits or eliminate them altogether for one or more years  following fiscal 2005. Section 29/45K provides that if the average wellhead  price per barrel for unregulated domestic crude oil for the year (the Annual  Average Price) exceeds a certain threshold value (the Threshold  Price), the Section 29/45K tax credits are subject to phase out. For calendar  year 2005, the Threshold Price was $53.20 per barrel and the Phase Out Price  was $66.78 per barrel. The Threshold Price and the Phase Out Price are adjusted  annually as a result of inflation. We cannot determine the Annual Average Price  for 2006 or beyond. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the price of oil  will have a material effect on our synthetic fuel business after fiscal 2005.  However, if during fiscals 2006 and 2007, oil prices remain at historically  high levels or increase, our synthetic fuel business may be adversely affected  for those years and, depending on the magnitude of the increases in oil prices,  the adverse affect for those years could be material and could have an impact  on our synthetic fuel results of operations and related income tax benefits.  Based upon the price of oil to date, we estimate the tax credits, for calendar  2006, would be subject to approximately a 35% phase out as of January 31, 2006.  Proposed federal legislation would establish both the 2006 Annual Average Price  and 2006 Phase Out Price based on the previous calendar year. If the proposed  legislation becomes law, we do not anticipate that we will reach the minimum  phase-out levels in 2006. Because synthetic fuel is not economical to produce  absent the associated tax credits, and we have no control or decision involvement  with production levels, we cannot determine the impact of possible production  reduction or elimination on our financial results.We may not be able to generatesufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets.We have approximately $39.3million of deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated financialstatements. Should future results of operations or other factors cause us todetermine that it is unlikely that we will generate sufficient taxable incometo fully utilize our deferred tax assets, we would then be required toestablish a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets by increasingour income tax expense in the amount of tax benefit we do not expect torealize. This would reduce our net income and could have a material adverseeffect on our results of operations.14We may realize capital losses related to our sales ofsynthetic fuel ownership interests.We have, for income taxpurposes, recognized capital gain in the year of sale for certain sales of ourownership interests in synthetic fuel entities. Should we, in subsequent years,realize a capital loss as a result of lower synthetic fuel production, forincome tax purposes, we may be required to carry the loss back to prior years.This could result in the write down of previously used Section 29/45K taxcredits. This would reduce our net income and could have a material adverseeffect on our results of operations.The loss of the services of our Chief Executive Officer orour other key employees could jeopardize our ability to maintain ourcompetitive position.We believe that our successdepends on the continued service of our key executive management personnel.Loss of the services of Stuart Rose, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,or other key employees could jeopardize our ability to maintain our competitiveposition in the industry. We have entered into an employment agreement with Mr.Rose, which runs through January 31, 2008. We have also entered into anemployment agreement with David Bearden, our President and Chief OperatingOfficer, which runs through January 31, 2008. We do not have employmentagreements with any other members of our executive management team.Fluctuations in our comparable store sales may cause theprice of our common stock to fluctuate substantially.Comparable store sales isa term we use to compare the year over year sales performance of our stores. Weconsider a store to be comparable after it has been open six full fiscalquarters.A number of factors havehistorically affected and will continue to affect our comparable store sales,including the following:    competition;    national and regional  economic conditions;    consumer trends;    new product introductions;    weather conditions which  can impact store traffic as well as sales of seasonal products such as air  conditioners;    changes in our product mix  and availability of products from key vendors;    duration of the holiday  selling season;     timing of promotional  events; and    attracting and retaining  qualified sales personnel.Comparable store sales areoften followed closely by the investment community and significant fluctuationsin these results could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuatesubstantially.Our quarterly operating results are subject to seasonality.Our retail business isseasonal. Our net retail sales and net income historically have been highest inour fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the Christmas selling season. Thefourth quarter accounted for approximately 33% and 32% of our net sales andrevenue, 52% and 72% of our income from operations, and 23% and 61% 15of our net income in fiscal 2005 and 2004,respectively. Our annual financial results would be adversely impacted if oursales were to fall substantially below what we normally expect during thisperiod.Wedepend on our suppliers for products and our business could be adverselyaffected if we do not maintain relationships with our key vendors.Our success depends to a significant degree upon oursuppliers of consumer electronics and home appliance products. We do not haveany long-term supply agreements or exclusive arrangements with vendors. Wetypically order merchandise by issuing individual purchase orders to vendors.We rely significantly on a few suppliers. Our 11 largest suppliers accountedfor approximately 81% of our purchases during fiscal 2005, with three suppliersrepresenting approximately 40% of our inventory purchases in fiscal 2005. Theloss of any of these key vendors, our failure to establish and maintainrelationships with our vendors, or any prolonged disruptions in product supply,could have a material adverse impact on our business.We mayincur higher costs or decreased sales and gross margins because we purchaseimported products.A significant portion of our inventory is manufacturedoutside the United States. Changes in trade regulations, currency fluctuationsor other factors may increase the cost of items manufactured outside the UnitedStates or create shortages of those items. We purchase all of our products inU.S. dollars. Significant reductions in the cost of such items in U.S. dollarsmay cause a significant reduction in retail price levels of those products,which could adversely affect our sales and gross margins.We face risks associated with our proposed ethanol investments  and our lack of experience in this industry. We may realize lower than expected  results from our proposed ethanol investments.At January 31, 2006, we have obtained letters of credit totaling  $12.5 million to secure our commitments to invest in two entities that will  construct and subsequently operate ethanol producing facilities. On March 17,  2006, we entered into an agreement to purchase a note in the principal amount  of $14 million issued by a limited liability company organized to construct  and operate an ethanol producing facility. We have obtained a letter of credit,  subsequent to January 31, 2006, to secure our commitment in this facility. We have not previously beeninvolved in this industry and we may encounter factors that could reduce thevalue of investments in the ethanol entities. Furthermore, each of theseentities is a recently organized development stage company with virtually nooperating history.We face risks associated with our proposed ethanol investments  and the construction of the ethanol plants as profitability from the investments  could be adversely affected if the plants are not completed within budget.The financial success of the entities is largelydependent upon the timely completion of the construction of ethanol plantswithin budget. Significant delays or cost overruns could significantly reduceprofitability from the ethanol producing facilities.We face risks associated with our proposed ethanolinvestments as raw material prices will fluctuate and could increase significantlyin the future, which will increase operating costs and adversely affectoperating results.Raw materials such as corn and sorghum experiencefluctuations in price related to weather, disease, changes in governmentincentives, demand and other factors. A significant reduction in the supply ofraw materials, or increases in the demand of raw materials, could result inhigher raw material prices. There is little correlation between the rawmaterial prices and the price of ethanol, which generally tends to track with16gasoline prices. Increases in raw material prices willgenerally produce lower profit margins because the price obtained for ethanolmay not increase.We face risks associated with our proposed ethanolinvestments as operating expenses will fluctuate and could increasesignificantly in the future, which will increase operating costs and adverselyaffect operating results.Operating expenses such as utilities andtransportation charges can be volatile and are affected by such items asgasoline and natural gas costs, and the ability of the entities to locate andobtain suitable rail or alternative transportation means.We face risks associated with our proposed ethanolinvestments from government regulations and the potential reduction in theselling price of ethanol.The fuel ethanol industry is highly dependent upon taxpolicies and environmental regulations that favor the use of ethanol in motorfuel blends in North America. The repeal or substantial modification of federalor state tax programs encouraging the use of ethanol could have a detrimentaleffect on the industry.Fuel ethanol prices could fluctuate, which could result in  returns from our ethanol investments being less than expected.Fuel ethanol prices are largely a function ofgovernment incentives and the wholesale price of gasoline. U.S. fuel ethanolprices generally parallel the movement of oil prices, which are extremelydifficult to forecast. A significant fall in fuel ethanol prices could have asignificant adverse effect on the industry.Our proposed ethanol investments are illiquid.Our contemplated ethanol investments will not be readily marketable  and their value is subject to adverse social and economic changes, rising operating  costs, and other associated business and financial difficulties. In addition,  these investments will not be registered under federal securities laws, and  will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer intended to preserve exemptions  from registration requirement under those securities laws. There can be no assurance  that, if it becomes necessary to sell or transfer ownership, a buyer could be  found or a suitable purchase price could be obtained. There is no public trading  market for these investments, and it is not anticipated that any such public  market will develop in the future. With no public trading market, it may be  extremely difficult or impossible for us to resell our investments should we  desire to do so"
