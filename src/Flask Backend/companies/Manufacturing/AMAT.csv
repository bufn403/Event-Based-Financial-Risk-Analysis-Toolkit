3,AMAT,APPLIED MATERIALS INC,2023-12-15,":      Risk Factors
The following risk factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and cause reputational harm, and should be carefully considered in evaluating our business, in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report.Business and Industry RisksThe industries we serve can be volatile and difficult to predict.We are a supplier to the global semiconductor and display and related industries, which historically have been cyclical and are subject to volatility and sudden changes in customer demand. Factors that impact demand for our products and services include technology inflections and advances in fabrication processes, new and emerging technologies and market drivers, production capacity relative to demand for chips and display technologies, end-user demand, customers’ capacity utilization, production volumes, access to affordable capital, business and consumer buying patterns and general economic and political conditions. Changes in demand can affect the timing and amounts of customer investments in technology and manufacturing equipment and can significantly impact our operating results. The amount and mix of our customers’ capital equipment spending between different products and technologies can also significantly impact our operating results.To meet rapidly changing demand, we must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage our resources, investments, production capacity, supply chain, workforce, inventory, and other components of our business. We may incur unexpected or additional costs to align our business operations with changes in demand. If we do not effectively manage these challenges, our business performance and operating results may be adversely impacted. Even with effective allocation of resources and management of costs, our gross and operating margins, cash flows and earnings may be adversely impacted during periods of changing demand.We are exposed to risks associated with an uncertain global economy.Uncertain or adverse economic and business conditions, including uncertainties and volatility in the financial markets, national debt, fiscal or monetary concerns, rising inflation and interest rates, bank failures, and economic recession, could materially and adversely impact our operating results. Markets for semiconductors and displays depend largely on business and consumer spending and demand for electronic products. Uncertain or adverse economic and business conditions could result in decreases in consumer spending and demand. Decreases in spending and demand have caused, and may in the future cause, our customers to push out, cancel or refrain from purchasing our equipment or services, which could negatively impact demand for our products and services, reduce our backlog, increase our inventory, and materially and adversely impact our operating results. Sudden increases in demand for electronic products have caused, and may in the future cause, a shortage of parts and materials needed to manufacture our products. Such shortages, and shipment delays due to transportation capacity and interruptions, have adversely impacted, and may in the future adversely impact, our suppliers’ ability to meet our requirements. Accelerated digital transformation may further increase demand and exacerbate shortages and strain our manufacturing capacity, which may adversely impact our ability to meet customer demand and have an adverse impact on our revenues, operating results and financial condition.Uncertain or adverse economic and market conditions, difficulties in obtaining capital, increased costs or reduced profitability may cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, which can result in lower sales, additional inventory or bad debt expense. Economic and industry uncertainty may impair the ability of suppliers to deliver parts and negatively affect our ability to manage operations and deliver our products. These conditions may also lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. Uncertain economic and industry conditions and supply chain challenges make it more difficult to accurately forecast operating results, make business decisions, and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect our businesses, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations. If we do not appropriately manage our business operations in response to changing economic and industry conditions, it could have a material and adverse impact on our business performance and financial condition. We may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, which may adversely impact our ability to capitalize on opportunities. Even during periods of economic uncertainty or lower demand, we must continue to invest in research and development and maintain a global business infrastructure to compete effectively and support our customers, which can have a negative impact on our operating results.We maintain an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. The risks to our investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate due to rising inflation, rising interest rates, bank failures or economic recession and, as a result, the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio and returns on pension assets, could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges. We also maintain cash balances in various bank 16Table of Contentsaccounts globally in order to fund normal operations. If any of these financial institutions become insolvent, it could limit our ability to access cash in the affected accounts, which could affect our ability to manage our operations.We are exposed to the risks of operating a global business.We have product development, engineering, manufacturing, sales and other operations in many countries, and some of our business activities are concentrated in certain geographic areas. In fiscal 2023, approximately 85% of our net sales were to customers in regions outside the United States. As a result of the global nature of our operations, our business performance and results of operations may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:•uncertain global economic, political and business conditions and demand;•global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade and export regulations, trade policies and sanctions, tariffs, and international trade disputes, including new and changing export regulations and their impact on our ability to export products and provide services to customers;•positions taken by governmental agencies regarding possible national, commercial or security issues posed by the development, sale or export of certain raw materials, products and technologies;•political instability, natural disasters, regional or global health epidemics, social unrest, terrorism, acts of war or other geopolitical turmoil, or cybersecurity incidents in locations where we have operations, suppliers or sales, or that may influence the value chain of the industries we serve;•political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations and policies within countries, including in China, the United States, and countries in Europe and Asia, that favor domestic companies over non-domestic companies, including efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors and reduce dependence on foreign semiconductor equipment and manufacturing capabilities through policies and financial incentives;•efforts to influence us to conduct more or less of our operations and sourcing in a particular country;•different and changing local, regional, national or international laws and regulations, including contract, intellectual property, cybersecurity, data privacy, labor, tax, and import/export laws, and the interpretation and application of laws and regulations;•ineffective or inadequate legal protection of intellectual property rights in certain countries;•interruptions to our or our suppliers’ supply chain;•the availability of, and increases and volatility of, raw materials, commodity, energy and shipping costs;•delays or restrictions on personnel travel and in shipping materials or products;•geographically diverse operations and projects, and our ability to maintain appropriate business processes, procedures and internal controls, and comply with environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption and other regulatory requirements;•challenges in hiring and integrating workers in different countries, and in effectively managing a diverse workforce with different experience levels, languages, cultures, customs, business practices and worker expectations, and differing employment practices and labor issues;•the ability to develop relationships with local customers, suppliers and governments;•fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates, including the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, Israeli shekel, euro, Taiwanese dollar, Singapore dollar, Chinese yuan or Korean won;•the need to provide technical support in different locations around the world;•performance of geographically diverse third-party providers, including certain engineering, software development, manufacturing, information technology and other functions;•service interruptions from utilities, transportation, data hosting or telecommunications providers;•impacts of climate change on our operations and those of our customers and suppliers;•the increasing need for a mobile workforce and travel to different regions; and•uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various countries, including for the manufacture and sale of semiconductors and displays in the developing economies of certain countries.17Table of ContentsGlobal trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade policies and export regulations, including import and export license requirements, trade sanctions, tariffs and international trade disputes, have adversely impacted and could further adversely impact our business and operations, and reduce the competitiveness of our products relative to local and global competitors.We sell a significant majority of our products into jurisdictions outside of the United States, including China, Taiwan, Korea and Japan. We also purchase a significant portion of equipment and supplies from suppliers outside of the United States. There is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships among the United States and the countries in which we conduct our business, that political, diplomatic, and national security factors can lead to global trade restrictions and changes in trade policies and export regulations, in particular, with respect to those affecting the semiconductor industry. The United States and other countries have imposed and may continue to impose new trade restrictions and export regulations, and have levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods. Trade restrictions and export regulations, or increases in tariffs and additional taxes, including any retaliatory measures, can negatively impact end-user demand and customer investment in manufacturing equipment, increase our supply chain complexity and our manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or restrict our ability to sell products, provide services or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, any or all of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.For example, certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses, and our inability to obtain such licenses has limited and could further limit our markets and negatively impact our business. In the past two years, the U.S. government announced new export regulations for U.S. semiconductor technology sold in China, including wafer fabrication equipment and related parts and services, which have limited the market for certain of our products, adversely impacted our revenues, and increased our exposure to foreign competition. The U.S. Department of Commerce has promulgated rules and regulations expanding export license requirements for U.S. companies that sell certain products to entities in China whose actions or functions are intended to support military end uses, eliminated certain export license exceptions that applied to exports of certain items to China, added certain Chinese companies to its “Entity List” and “Unverified List,” making those companies subject to additional licensing requirements, and expanded licensing requirements for exports to China of items for use in the development or production of integrated circuits and certain technologies. These rules and regulations require us to obtain additional export licenses to supply certain of our products or provide services to certain customers in China. Obtaining export licenses may be difficult, costly and time-consuming, and there is no assurance we will be issued licenses on a timely basis or at all. Our inability to obtain such licenses could limit our markets in China, may cause us to be displaced by foreign businesses and competitors and adversely affect our results of operations. The implementation and interpretation of these complex rules and other regulatory actions taken by the U.S. government is uncertain and evolving, and may make it more challenging for us to manage our operations and forecast our operating results. The U.S. and other government agencies may promulgate new or additional export licensing or other requirements that have the effect of further limiting our ability to provide certain products and services to customers outside the U.S., including China. The U.S. government may also revise or expand existing requirements or issue guidance clarifying the scope and application of these requirements, which could change the impact of these rules on our business and manufacturing operations. The U.S. government may also continue to add customers to its “Entity List” and “Unverified List,” or take measures that could disrupt our product shipments to certain customers. These and other potential future regulatory changes could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.As a global business with customers, suppliers and operations in many countries around the world, from time to time we may receive inquiries from government authorities about transactions between us and certain foreign entities. In August 2022, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts requesting information relating to certain China customer shipments. In November 2023, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security requesting the same information. We are cooperating fully with the government in these matters. These inquiries are subject to uncertainties, and we cannot predict the outcome of these inquiries, or any other governmental inquires or proceedings that may occur. Any violation or alleged violation of law or regulations could result in significant legal costs or in legal proceedings in which we or our employees could be subjected to fines and penalties and could result in restrictions on our business and damage to our global brand and reputation, and could have a material and adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.Furthermore, government authorities may take retaliatory actions, impose conditions that require the use of local suppliers or partnerships with local companies, require the license or other transfer of sensitive data or intellectual property, or engage in other efforts to promote local businesses and local competitors, which could have a material and adverse impact on our business. Many of these challenges are present in China and Korea, markets that represent a significant portion of our business.We are exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base.A relatively limited number of customers account for a substantial portion of our business. Our customer base is geographically concentrated, particularly in China, Taiwan, Korea and Japan. As a result, the actions of even a single customer or export regulations that apply to customers in certain countries, such as those in China, have exposed and can further expose 18Table of Contentsour business and operating results to greater volatility. The geographic concentration of our customer base could shift over time as a result of government policy and incentives to develop regional semiconductor industries. The mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, including as a result of changes in government policy, have varied and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year, and have had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on our operating results. Our products are configured to customer specifications, and changing, rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant, non-recoverable costs. If customers do not place orders, or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel orders (including as a result of uncertain or adverse economic conditions, our inability to fulfill orders due to export regulations, shortage of parts, transportation capacity/interruptions or any other reason), we may not be able to replace the business, which may have a material and adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. The concentration of our customer base increases our risks related to the financial condition of our customers, and the deterioration in financial condition of a single customer or the failure of a single customer to perform its obligations could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow. To the extent our customers experience liquidity constraints, we may incur bad debt expense, which may have a significant impact on our results of operations. Major customers may seek pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to us, which may have a negative impact on our business, cash flow, revenue and gross margins.Supply chain disruptions, manufacturing interruptions or delays, or the failure to accurately forecast customer demand, could affect our ability to meet customer demand, lead to higher costs, or result in excess or obsolete inventory.Our business depends on our timely supply of equipment, services and related products to meet the changing requirements of our customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts, materials and services from suppliers and contract manufacturers. Increases in demand for our products and worldwide demand for electronic products can impact our suppliers’ ability to meet our demand requirements, and have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a shortage of parts, materials and services needed to manufacture our products. Such shortages, as well as delays in and unpredictability of shipments due to transportation interruptions, have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our manufacturing operations and our ability to meet customer demand. Volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment can also increase our and our suppliers’ capital, technical, operational and other risks, and may cause some suppliers to exit businesses, or scale back or cease operations, which could impact our ability to meet customer demand. Ongoing supply chain constraints may continue to increase costs of logistics and parts for our products and may cause us to pass on increased costs to our customers, which may lead to reduced demand for our products and materially and adversely impact our operating results. Supply chain disruptions have caused and may continue to cause delays in our equipment production and delivery schedules, which can lead to our business performance becoming significantly dependent on quarter-end production and delivery schedules, and could have an adverse impact on our operating and financial results.Cybersecurity incidents affecting our suppliers could impact our supply chain and may also cause difficulties and delays in our ability to obtain parts, materials and services needed to manufacture our products and provide services, and may adversely impact our manufacturing operations, our ability to meet customer demand, and our operating results. Failure to timely recover from such delays could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and may also cause our business and financial outlook to be inaccurate.We may experience supply chain disruptions, significant interruptions of our manufacturing operations, delays in our ability to deliver or install products or services, increased costs, customer order cancellations or reduced demand for our products as a result of:•global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade and export regulations, trade policies and sanctions, tariffs, international trade disputes, and new and changing regulations for exports of certain technologies to China, where a significant portion of our supply chain is located, and any retaliatory measures, that adversely impact us or our direct or sub-tier suppliers;•the failure or inability to accurately forecast demand and obtain quality parts on a cost-effective basis;•volatility in the availability and cost of parts, commodities, energy and shipping related to our products, including increased costs due to rising inflation or interest rates or other market conditions;•difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export licenses and approvals;•shipment delays due to transportation interruptions or capacity constraints;•a worldwide shortage of semiconductor components as a result of sharp increases in demand for semiconductor products in general;•limited availability of feasible alternatives to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, which are found in parts, components, process chemicals and other materials supplied to us or used in the operations of our products; 19Table of Contents•cybersecurity incidents or information technology or infrastructure failures, including those of a third-party supplier or service provider; and•natural disasters, the impacts of climate change, or other events beyond our control (such as earthquakes, utility interruptions, tsunamis, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, storms or extreme weather conditions, fires, regional economic downturns, regional or global health epidemics, geopolitical turmoil, increased trade restrictions between the U.S. and China and other countries, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war) in locations where we or our customers or suppliers have manufacturing, research, engineering or other operations.If a supplier fails to meet our requirements concerning quality, cost, intellectual property protection, socially-responsible business practices, or other performance factors, we may transfer our business to alternative sources. Transferring business to alternative suppliers could result in manufacturing delays, additional costs or other difficulties, and may impair our ability to protect, enforce and extract the full value of our intellectual property rights, and the intellectual property rights of our customers and other third parties. These outcomes could have a material and adverse impact on our business and competitive position and subject us to legal proceedings and claims. If we are unable to meet our customers’ demand for a prolonged period due to our inability to obtain certain parts or components from suppliers on a timely basis or at all, our business, results of operations and customer relationships could be adversely impacted.If we need to rapidly increase our business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules, this may strain our manufacturing and supply chain operations, and negatively impact our working capital. If we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products, we may purchase more or fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery of parts. If we purchase or commit to purchase inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize, or such inventory is rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, or if customers reduce, delay or cancel orders, we may incur excess or obsolete inventory charges.We are exposed to ongoing changes in the various industries in which we operate.The global semiconductor, display and related industries are characterized by ongoing changes that impact demand for and the profitability of our products and services and our operating results, including:•the nature, timing and degree of visibility of changes in end-user demand for electronic products, including those related to fluctuations in consumer buying patterns tied to general economic conditions, seasonality or the introduction of new products, and the effects of these changes on customers’ businesses and on demand for our products;•increasing capital requirements for building and operating new fabrication plants and customers’ ability to raise the necessary capital;•trade, regulatory, tax or government incentives impacting the timing of customers’ investment in new or expanded fabrication plants;•differences in growth rates among the semiconductor, display and other industries in which we operate;•the importance of establishing, improving and maintaining strong relationships with customers;•the cost and complexity for customers to move from product design to volume manufacturing, which may slow the adoption rate of new manufacturing technology;•the importance of reducing the total cost of manufacturing system ownership;•the importance to customers of system reliability and productivity and the effect on demand for fabrication systems as a result of their increasing productivity, device yield and reliability;•manufacturers’ ability to reconfigure and re-use fabrication systems which can reduce demand for new equipment;•the importance of developing products with sufficient differentiation to influence customers’ purchasing decisions;•requirements for shorter cycle times for the development, manufacture and installation of manufacturing equipment;•price and performance trends for semiconductor devices and displays, and the impact on demand for such products;•the importance of the availability of spare parts to maximize the time that customers’ systems are available for production;•government incentives for local suppliers and domestic semiconductor research, development and manufacturing capabilities;•the increasing role for and complexity of software in our products;•the increasing role of machine learning and artificial intelligence with respect to semiconductor equipment and related services; and20Table of Contents•the focus on reducing energy usage and improving the environmental impact and sustainability associated with manufacturing operations.We are exposed to ongoing changes specific to the semiconductor industry.The largest proportion of our consolidated net sales and profitability is derived from sales of manufacturing equipment in the Semiconductor Systems segment to the global semiconductor industry, and a majority of the revenues of Applied Global Services is from sales to semiconductor manufacturers. The semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of our semiconductor manufacturing equipment and service products, including:•the frequency and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, and our ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes;•the cost of research and development due to many factors, including shrinking geometries, the use of new materials, new and more complex device structures, more applications and process steps, increasing chip design costs, and the cost and complexity of integrated manufacturing processes;•the need to reduce product development time and meet technical challenges;•the number of types and varieties of semiconductors and number of applications;•the cost and complexity for semiconductor manufacturers to move more technically advanced capability and smaller geometries to volume manufacturing, and the impact on investment in capital equipment;•semiconductor manufacturers’ levels of capital expenditures and the allocation of capital investment to market segments that we do not serve, such as lithography, or segments where our products have lower relative market presence;•delays in installation of manufacturing equipment delivered to customers;•the importance of increasing market positions in segments with growing demand;•semiconductor manufacturers’ ability to reconfigure and re-use equipment, resulting in diminished need to purchase new equipment and services from us, and challenges in providing parts for reused equipment;•shorter cycle times between order placements by customers and product shipment require greater reliance on forecasting of customer investment, which may lead to inventory write-offs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease gross margin;•competitive factors that make it difficult to enhance position, including challenges in securing development-tool-of-record (DTOR) and production-tool-of-record (PTOR) positions with customers;•consolidation in the semiconductor industry, including among semiconductor manufacturers and among manufacturing equipment suppliers;•shifts in sourcing strategies by computer and electronics companies, and manufacturing processes for advanced circuit technologies, that impact the equipment requirements of our foundry customers;•the concentration of new wafer starts in Korea and Taiwan, where our service penetration and service-revenue-per-wafer-start have been lower than in other regions; •the increasing fragmentation of semiconductor markets, leading certain markets to become too small to support the cost of a new fabrication plant, while others require less technologically advanced products; and•the growing importance of specialty markets (such as Internet of Things, communications, automotive, power and sensors) that use mature process technologies and have a low barrier to entry.If we do not accurately forecast and allocate appropriate resources and investment towards addressing key technology changes and inflections, successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new technologies, and effectively address industry trends, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted.We are exposed to ongoing changes specific to the display industry.The global display industry has experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment investment levels, due in part to the limited number of display manufacturers, the concentrated nature of end-use applications, production capacity relative to end-use demand, and panel manufacturer profitability. Industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced TVs, and on demand for advanced smartphones and mobile device displays, which demand is highly sensitive to cost and improvements in technologies and features. The display industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of our display products and services, including:21Table of Contents•the importance of new types of display technologies, such as organic light-emitting diode (OLED), low temperature polysilicon (LTPS) and metal oxide transistor backplanes, flexible displays, and new touch panel films;•the increasing cost of research and development, and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, and our ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes;•the timing and extent of an expansion of manufacturing facilities in China, which may be affected by changes in economic conditions and governmental regulations, including trade policies and export regulations;•the importance of increasing market positions in products and technologies with growing demand;•the rate of transition to new display technologies for TVs, information technology products and mobile applications, and augmented and virtual reality applications, and the resulting effect on capital intensity in the industry and on our product differentiation, gross margin and return on investment;•the concentration of display manufacturer customers, and fluctuations in customer spending quarter over quarter and year over year for display manufacturing equipment; and•the dependence on a limited number of display manufacturer customers’ selection of new technologies, and their ability to successfully commercialize new products and technologies, and uncertainty with respect to future display technology end-use applications and growth drivers.The display industry has experienced decreased levels of investment in manufacturing equipment. If we do not successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new and emerging display technologies, or if industry demand for display manufacturing equipment and technologies does not grow, our business and our operating results may continue to be adversely impacted.The industries in which we operate are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market changes.We operate in a highly competitive environment in which innovation is critical, and our future success depends on many factors, including the development of new technologies and effective commercialization and customer acceptance of our equipment, services and related products, and our ability to increase our position in our current markets, expand into adjacent and new markets, and optimize operational performance. The development, introduction and support of products in a geographically diverse and competitive environment requires collaboration with customers and other industry participants, which has grown more complex and expensive over time. New or improved products may entail higher costs, longer development cycles, lower profits and may have unforeseen product design or manufacturing defects. To compete successfully, we must:•identify and address technology inflections, market changes, competitor innovations, new applications, customer requirements and end-use demand in a timely and effective manner;•develop new products and disruptive technologies, improve and develop new applications for existing products, and adapt products for use by customers in different applications and markets with varying technical requirements;•complete major infrastructure projects on schedule and on budget, and realize the anticipated benefits of those projects;•differentiate our products from those of competitors, meet customers’ performance specifications (including those related to energy consumption and environmental impact more broadly), appropriately price products, and achieve market acceptance;•effectively and timely implement artificial intelligence strategies for our product and service offerings, which may be costly or ineffective, introduce errors, cause loss of intellectual property, and raise complex regulatory compliance, intellectual property and other issues; •maintain operating flexibility to enable responses to changing markets, applications and customer requirements;•enhance our worldwide operations across our businesses to reduce cycle time, enable continuous quality improvement, reduce costs, and enhance design for manufacturability and serviceability;•focus on product development and sales and marketing strategies that address customers’ high value problems and strengthen customer relationships;•effectively allocate resources between our existing products and markets, the development of new products, and expanding into new and adjacent markets;•improve the productivity of capital invested in R&D activities;•accurately forecast demand, work with suppliers and meet production schedules for our products;•improve our manufacturing processes and achieve cost efficiencies across product offerings;22Table of Contents•adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different parts of the supply chain;•qualify products for evaluation and volume manufacturing with our customers; and •implement changes in our design engineering methodology to reduce material costs and cycle time, increase commonality of platforms and types of parts used in different systems, and improve product life cycle management.If we do not successfully anticipate technology inflections, develop and commercialize new products and technologies, and respond to changes in customer requirements and market trends, our business performance and operating results may be materially and adversely impacted.We are exposed to risks associated with expanding into new and related markets and industries.As part of our growth strategy, we seek to continue to expand into related or new markets and industries, either with our existing products or with new products developed internally, or those developed in collaboration with third parties, or obtained through acquisitions. Our ability to successfully expand our business into new and related markets and industries may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:•the need to devote additional resources to develop new products for, and operate in, new markets;•the need to develop new sales and technical marketing strategies, and to develop relationships with new customers;•differing rates of profitability and growth among multiple businesses;•our ability to anticipate demand, capitalize on opportunities, and avoid or minimize risks;•the complexity of managing multiple businesses with variations in production planning, execution, supply chain management and logistics;•the adoption of new business models, business processes and systems;•the complexity of entering into and effectively managing strategic alliances or partnering opportunities;•new materials, processes and technologies;•the need to attract, motivate and retain employees with skills and expertise in these new areas;•new and more diverse customers and suppliers, including some with limited operating histories, uncertain or limited funding, evolving business models or locations in regions where we do not have, or have limited, operations;•new or different competitors with potentially more financial or other resources, industry experience and established customer relationships;•entry into new industries and countries, with differing levels of government involvement, laws and regulations, and business, employment and safety practices and requirements;•third parties’ intellectual property rights; and•the need to comply with, or work to establish, industry standards and practices.From time to time we receive funding from the United States and other government agencies for certain strategic development programs to increase our research and development resources and address new market opportunities. As a condition to this government funding, we are often subject to certain record-keeping, audit, intellectual property rights-sharing, and/or other obligations.Operational and Financial RisksWe are exposed to risks related to protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights.Our success depends on the protection of our technology using patents, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights. Infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, such as the manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts that use our technology without authorization, could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities. Monitoring and detecting any unauthorized access, use or disclosure of our intellectual property is difficult and costly and we cannot be certain that the protective measures we have implemented will completely prevent misuse. Our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to litigation risks and uncertainty as to the protection and enforceability of those rights in some countries. If we seek to enforce our intellectual property rights, we may be subject to claims that those rights are invalid or unenforceable, and others may seek counterclaims against us, which could have a negative impact on our business. If we are unable to enforce and protect intellectual property rights, or if they are circumvented, rendered obsolete, invalidated by the rapid pace of technological change, or stolen or misappropriated by employees or third parties, it could have an adverse impact on our competitive position and business. Changes in intellectual property laws or their interpretation may impact our ability to protect and assert our intellectual property rights, increase costs and uncertainties in the prosecution of 23Table of Contentspatent applications or related enforcement actions, and diminish the value and competitive advantage conferred by our intellectual property assets.From time to time third parties have asserted, and may continue to assert, intellectual property claims against us and our products. Claims that our products infringe the rights of others, whether or not meritorious, can be expensive and time-consuming to defend and resolve, and may divert the efforts and attention of management and personnel. The inability to obtain rights to use third-party intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could have an adverse impact on our business. We may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets and other confidential business information. Any such incidents and claims could severely harm our business and reputation, result in significant expenses, harm our competitive position, and prevent us from selling certain products, all of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business and results of operations.We are exposed to cybersecurity threats and incidents.In the conduct of our business, we collect, use, transmit, store, and otherwise process data using information technology systems, including systems owned and maintained by us or our third-party providers. These data include confidential information and intellectual property belonging to us or our customers or other business partners, and personal information of individuals. All information technology systems are subject to disruptions, outages, failures, and security breaches or incidents. We and our third-party providers have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, cybersecurity incidents. Cybersecurity incidents may range from employee or contractor error or misuse or unauthorized use of information technology systems or confidential information, to individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to these information systems, to sophisticated cybersecurity attacks, known as advanced persistent threats, any of which may target us directly or indirectly through our third-party providers and global supply chain. Cybersecurity attacks are increasing in number and the attackers are increasingly organized and well-financed, or at times supported by state actors. Geopolitical tensions or conflicts, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine or increasing tension with China, may create a heightened risk of cybersecurity attacks. To the extent artificial intelligence capabilities improve and are increasingly adopted, they may be used to identify vulnerabilities and craft increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity attacks. Vulnerabilities may be introduced from the use of artificial intelligence by us, our customers, suppliers and other business partners and third-party providers. Although we are not aware of any cybersecurity incidents impacting us directly that have been material to us to date, we continue to devote significant resources to network security, data encryption, and other measures to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse, and we may be required to expend greater resources in the future, especially in the face of evolving and increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity threats and laws, regulations, and other actual and asserted obligations to which we are or may become subject relating to privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity. We may be unable to anticipate, prevent, or remediate future attacks, vulnerabilities, breaches, or incidents, and in some instances we may be unaware of vulnerabilities or cybersecurity breaches or incidents or their magnitude and effects, particularly as attackers are becoming increasingly able to circumvent controls and remove forensic evidence. Cybersecurity incidents may result in business disruption; delay in the development and delivery of our products; disruption of our manufacturing processes, internal communications, interactions with customers and suppliers and processing and reporting financial results; the theft or misappropriation of intellectual property; corruption, loss of, or inability to access (e.g., through ransomware or denial of service) confidential information and critical data (i.e., that of our company and our third-party providers and customers); reputational damage; private claims, demands, and litigation or regulatory investigations, enforcement actions, or other proceedings related to contractual or regulatory privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, or other confidentiality obligations; diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering; and increased costs associated with the implementation of cybersecurity measures to detect, deter, protect against, and recover from such incidents. Our efforts to comply with, and changes to, laws, regulations, and contractual and other actual and asserted obligations concerning privacy, cybersecurity, and data protection, including developing restrictions on cross-border data transfer and data localization, could result in significant expense, and any actual or alleged failure to comply could result in inquiries, investigations, and other proceedings against us by regulatory authorities or other third parties. Customers and third-party providers increasingly demand rigorous contractual provisions regarding privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, confidentiality, and intellectual property, which may increase our overall compliance burden.We are exposed to risks associated with business combinations, acquisitions, strategic investments and divestitures.We may engage in acquisitions of or investments in companies, technologies or products in existing, related or new markets. Business combinations, acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks to our business, financial condition and operating results, including:•inability to complete proposed transactions timely or at all due to the failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals, litigation or other disputes, and any ensuing obligation to pay a termination fee;•diversion of management’s attention and disruption of ongoing businesses;•the failure to realize expected revenues, gross and operating margins, net income and other returns from acquired businesses;24Table of Contents•requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures and restrictions on the conduct of our existing business or the acquired business;•following completion of acquisitions, ineffective integration of businesses, operations, systems, digital and physical security, technologies, products, employees, compliance programs, changes in laws or regulations, including tax laws, or other factors, may impact the ability to realize anticipated synergies or other benefits;•failure to commercialize technologies from acquired businesses or developed through strategic investments;•dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;•inability to capitalize on characteristics of new markets that may be significantly different from our existing markets and where competitors may have stronger market positions and customer relationships;•failure to retain and motivate key employees of acquired businesses;•the impact of the announcement or consummation of a proposed transaction on relationships with third parties;•changes in our credit rating, which could adversely impact our access to and cost of capital;•increases in debt obligations to finance activities associated with a transaction, which increase interest expense, and reductions in cash balances, which reduce the availability of cash flow for general corporate or other purposes, including share repurchases and dividends;•exposure to new operational risks, rules, regulations, worker expectations, customs and practices to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where we have not historically conducted business;•challenges associated with managing new, more diverse and more widespread operations, projects and people;•inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key technologies;•inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company’s internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, cybersecurity, privacy policies and compliance programs, or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices;•impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the segment;•the risk of litigation or claims associated with a proposed or completed transaction;•unknown, underestimated, undisclosed or undetected commitments or liabilities, including potential intellectual property infringement claims, or non-compliance with laws, regulations or policies; and•the inappropriate scale of acquired entities’ critical resources or facilities for business needs.We make investments in other companies, including companies formed as joint ventures, which may decline in value or not meet desired objectives. The success of these investments depends on various factors over which we may have limited or no control and, particularly with respect to joint ventures, requires ongoing and effective cooperation with partners. In addition, new legislation, additional regulations or global economic or political conditions may affect or impair our ability to invest in certain countries or require us to obtain regulatory approvals to do so. We may not receive the necessary regulatory approvals or the approvals may come with significant conditions or obligations. The risks to our investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and, as a result, the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges.We may seek to divest portions of our business that are not deemed to fit with our strategic plan. Divestitures involve additional risks and uncertainties, such as ability to sell such businesses on satisfactory price and terms and in a timely manner, or at all, disruption to other parts of the businesses and distraction of management, allocation of internal resources that would otherwise be devoted to completing strategic acquisitions, loss of key employees or customers, exposure to unanticipated liabilities or ongoing obligations to support the businesses following such divestitures, and other adverse financial impacts.The ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital to our success.Our success depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees and leaders with the necessary expertise and capabilities, representing diverse backgrounds and experiences. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, management or organizational changes, ongoing competition for talent, the availability of qualified employees, the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries, the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs, our career growth and development opportunities, and our employment policies. If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees and leaders, we may be unable to fully capitalize on current and new market opportunities, which could 25Table of Contentsadversely impact our business and results of operations. The loss of knowledgeable and experienced employees may result in unexpected costs, reduced productivity, or difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls.We operate in jurisdictions with complex and changing tax laws.We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. Our provision for income taxes and effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in applicable tax laws, interpretations of applicable tax laws, amount and composition of pre-tax income in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, and valuation of deferred tax assets. There have been a number of proposed changes in the tax laws that, if enacted, would increase our tax liability. While it is too early to predict the outcome of these proposals, if enacted, they could have a material impact on our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. An increase in our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate could, in turn, have a material and adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. For example, several countries where we do business have announced plans to implement global minimum tax regimes based on the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project. If implemented, these global minimum tax regimes would change various aspects of the existing framework under which our global tax obligations are determined, which would unfavorably impact our existing tax incentives and effective tax rate. As this framework is subject to further negotiation and implementation by each member country, the timing and ultimate impact of any such changes on our tax obligations are uncertain.Consistent with the international nature of our business, we conduct certain manufacturing, supply chain, and other operations in Asia, bringing these activities closer to customers and reducing operating costs. In some foreign jurisdictions, we must meet certain requirements to continue to qualify for tax incentives. There is no assurance we will be able to meet such requirements in the future to fully realize benefits from these incentives. Furthermore, the proposed plans to implement global minimum tax regimes could reduce or eliminate the benefits of our tax incentives.We are subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and from time to time amend previously filed tax returns. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, which requires estimates and judgments. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance the tax authorities will agree with such estimates. We may have to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the estimates, which may be time-consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that we will be successful or that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and effective tax rates.Our indebtedness and debt covenants could adversely affect our financial condition and business.As of October 29, 2023, we had $5.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding. Under the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes, we may be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if we experience a change of control and a contemporaneous downgrade of the notes below investment grade. We also have in place a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. While no amounts were outstanding under this credit facility as of October 29, 2023, we may borrow amounts in the future under this credit facility or enter into new financing arrangements. Our ability to satisfy our debt obligations is dependent upon the results of our business operations and subject to other risks discussed in this section. If we fail to satisfy our debt obligations, or comply with financial and other debt covenants, we may be in default and any borrowings may become immediately due and payable, and such default may constitute a default under our other obligations. There can be no assurance that we would have sufficient financial resources or be able to arrange financing to repay any borrowings at such time. Significant changes in our credit rating, disruptions in the global financial markets, or incurrence of new or refinancing of existing indebtedness at higher interest rates could have a material and adverse impact on our access to and cost of capital for future financings, and financial condition. The failure to successfully implement enterprise resource planning and other information systems changes could adversely impact our business and operating results.We periodically implement new or enhanced enterprise resource planning and related information systems in order to better manage our business operations, align our global organizations and enable future growth. Implementation of new business processes and information systems requires the commitment of significant personnel, training and financial resources, and entails risks to our business operations. If we do not successfully implement enterprise resource planning and related information systems improvements, or if there are delays or difficulties in implementing these systems, we may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies, and may experience interruptions in service and operational difficulties, which could result in quality issues, reputational harm, lost market and revenue opportunities, and otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.26Table of ContentsWe may incur impairment charges related to goodwill or long-lived assets.We have a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions. Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The review compares the fair value for each of our reporting units to its associated carrying value, including goodwill. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, declines in the market price of our common stock, changes in our strategies or product portfolio, and restructuring activities. Our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance. We may be required to record future charges to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets is determined to exist.We may not continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase our shares.Our ability to continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase our shares is subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and share repurchases are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and agreements. Future dividends and share repurchases may be affected by, among other factors, our cash flow; potential future capital requirements for investments, acquisitions, infrastructure projects, and research and development; changes in applicable tax, corporate, or other laws; contractual restrictions, such as financial or operating covenants in our debt arrangements; and changes to our business model. Our dividend payments and share repurchases may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase shares in any particular amounts or at all. A reduction or suspension in our dividend payments or share repurchases could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock.Legal, Compliance, and Other RisksWe are exposed to risks related to legal proceedings, claims and investigations.From time to time we are, and in the future may be, involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement, trade secret misappropriation, other intellectual property rights, trade compliance, including import, export and customs, antitrust, environmental regulations, privacy, data protection, securities, contracts, product performance, product liability, unfair competition, employment, workplace safety, and other matters. We may receive, and have received, inquiries, warrants, subpoenas, and other requests for information in connection with government investigations of potential or suspected violations of law or regulations by our company and/or our employees. We also on occasion receive notifications from customers who believe we owe them indemnification, product warranty or have other obligations related to claims made against such customers by third parties.Legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations, whether with or without merit, and internal investigations, may be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct; divert management’s attention and our other resources; constrain our ability to sell our products and services; result in adverse judgments for damages, injunctive relief, penalties and fines; and negatively affect our business. We cannot predict the outcome of current or future legal proceedings, claims or investigations.We are exposed to risks related to the global regulatory environment.We are subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions, including those related to financial and other disclosures, accounting standards, corporate governance, intellectual property, tax, trade (including import, export and customs), antitrust, environment, health and safety (including those relating to climate change), employment, immigration and travel regulations, human rights, privacy, data protection and localization, and anti-corruption. Changing, inconsistent or conflicting laws, rules and regulations, and ambiguities in their interpretation and application create uncertainty and challenges, and compliance with laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive, divert management time and attention from revenue-generating activities, and otherwise adversely impact our business operations. Violations of law, rules and regulations, including, among others, those related to financial and other disclosures, trade, import and export regulations, antitrust, privacy, data protection, and anti-corruption, could result in fines, criminal penalties, restrictions on our business, and damage to our reputation, and could have an adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.Our environmental, social and governance strategies and targets could result in additional costs, and our inability to achieve them could have an adverse impact on our reputation and performance.We periodically communicate our strategies and targets related to sustainability, carbon emissions, diversity and inclusion, human rights, and other environmental, social and governance matters. These strategies and targets, and their 27Table of Contentsunderlying assumptions and projections, reflect our current plans and aspirations, and we may be unable to achieve them. Changing customer and shareholder sustainability expectations and regulatory requirements, as well as our sustainability targets, could cause us to incur substantial expense and alter our manufacturing, operations or equipment designs and processes. Any failure or perceived failure to timely meet these sustainability requirements, expectations or targets, or a failure to realize the anticipated benefits of planned investments and technology innovations related to sustainability, could adversely impact the demand for our products and subject us to significant costs and liabilities and reputational risks that could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, standards and processes for measuring and reporting carbon emissions and other sustainability metrics may change over time, and may result in inconsistent data, or could result in significant revisions to our strategies and targets, or our ability to achieve them. Any scrutiny of our carbon emissions or other sustainability disclosures, our failure to achieve related strategies and targets, or our failure to disclose our sustainability measures consistent with applicable laws and regulations or to the satisfaction of our stakeholders could negatively impact our reputation or performance. We are subject to risks associated with environmental, health and safety regulations.We are subject to environmental, health and safety regulations in connection with our global business operations, including but not limited to: regulations related to the design, manufacture, sale, shipping and use of our products; use, handling, discharge, recycling, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials used in our products or in producing our products; the operation of our facilities; and the use of our real property, including in connection with construction of our infrastructure projects. The failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental, health and safety regulations could result in: significant remediation or other legal liabilities; the imposition of penalties and fines; restrictions on the development, manufacture, sale, shipping or use of certain of our products; limitations on the operation of our facilities or ability to use our real property; and a decrease in the value of our real property. We could be required to alter our product design, manufacturing, and operations, and incur substantial expense in order to comply with environmental, health and safety regulations. Any failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to significant costs and liabilities that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.28Table of Contents"
5,AMAT,APPLIED MATERIALS INC,2022-12-16,":      Risk Factors
The following risk factors could materially and adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition or results of operations and cause reputational harm, and should be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its business, in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report.Business and Industry RisksThe industries that Applied serves can be volatile and difficult to predict.As a supplier to the global semiconductor and display and related industries, Applied is subject to variable industry conditions, since demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on several factors, including the nature and timing of technology inflections and advances in fabrication processes, the timing and requirements of new and emerging technologies and market drivers, production capacity relative to demand for chips and display technologies, end-user demand, customers’ capacity utilization, production volumes, access to affordable capital, consumer buying patterns and general economic and political conditions. Applied’s industries historically have been cyclical, and are subject to volatility and sudden changes in customer requirements for new manufacturing capacity and advanced technology. These changes can affect the timing and amounts of customer investments in technology and manufacturing equipment and can have a significant impact on Applied’s net sales, operating expenses, gross margins and net income. The amount and mix of capital equipment spending between different products and technologies can have a significant impact on Applied’s results of operations.To meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves, Applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity across its businesses, and may incur unexpected or additional costs to align its business operations. During periods of increasing demand for its products, Applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand; effectively manage its supply chain; attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees; and continue to control costs. During periods of decreasing demand, Applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions; effectively manage its supply chain; and motivate and retain key employees. If Applied does not effectively manage these challenges during periods of changing demand, its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted. Even with effective allocation of resources and management of costs, during periods of decreasing demand, Applied’s gross margins, cash flows and earnings may be adversely impacted.Applied is exposed to risks associated with an uncertain global economy.Uncertain or adverse economic and business conditions, including uncertainties and volatility in the financial markets, national debt, fiscal or monetary concerns, rising inflation and interest rates in various regions, and economic recession, could materially adversely impact Applied’s operating results. Markets for semiconductors and displays depend largely on business and consumer spending and demand for electronic products. Uncertain or adverse economic and business conditions could result in decreases in consumer spending and demand. Such decreases in spending and demand have in the past caused, and may in the future cause, our customers to push out, cancel or refrain from purchasing our equipment or services, which could negatively impact demand for our products and services, reduce our backlog, increase our inventory, and materially adversely impact our operating results. Similarly, changes that result in sudden increases in consumer demand for electronic products have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a shortage of parts and materials needed to manufacture our products. Such shortages, as well as shipment delays due to transportation capacity and interruptions, have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our suppliers’ ability to meet our demand requirements. Accelerated digital transformation may further increase consumer demand and exacerbate such shortages and also strain our manufacturing capacity, which may adversely impact our ability to meet customer demands and thus have an adverse impact on our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.Uncertain or adverse economic and market conditions, difficulties in obtaining capital, increased costs or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, which can also result in lower sales, additional inventory or bad debt expense for Applied. Economic and industry uncertainty may similarly affect suppliers, which could impair their ability to deliver parts and negatively affect Applied’s ability to manage operations and deliver its products. These conditions may also lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect Applied’s ability to compete effectively. 16Table of ContentsUncertain economic and industry conditions and continued supply chain disruptions also make it more challenging for Applied to forecast its operating results, make business decisions, and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations. If Applied does not appropriately manage its business operations in response to changing economic and industry conditions, it could have a significant negative impact on its business performance and financial condition. Applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, which may adversely affect Applied’s ability to capitalize on opportunities. Even during periods of economic uncertainty or lower revenues, Applied must continue to invest in research and development and maintain a global business infrastructure to compete effectively and support its customers, which can have a negative impact on its operating margins and earnings.Applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. The risks to Applied’s investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate due to rising inflation, rising interest rates, economic recession or impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and, as a result, the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio, as well as returns on pension assets, could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges. Applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations. If any of these financial institutions becomes insolvent, it could limit Applied’s ability to access cash in the affected accounts, which could affect its ability to manage its operations.Applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business.Applied has product development, engineering, manufacturing, sales and other operations distributed throughout many countries, and some of its business activities are concentrated in certain geographic areas. Moreover, in fiscal 2022, approximately 88% of Applied’s net sales were to customers in regions outside the United States. As a result of the global nature of its operations, Applied’s business performance and results of operations may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:•uncertain global economic and political business conditions and demands;•global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade and export regulations, trade policies and sanctions, tariffs, and international trade disputes, including new and changing export regulations for certain exports to China and any retaliatory measures;•positions taken by governmental agencies regarding possible national, commercial and/or security issues posed by the development, sale or export of certain products and technologies;•political instability, natural disasters, regional or global health epidemics, social unrest, terrorism, acts of war or other geopolitical turmoil, or cybersecurity incidents in locations where Applied has operations, suppliers or sales, or that may influence the value chain of the industries that Applied serves;•political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations and policies within countries that favor domestic companies over non-domestic companies, including customer- or government-supported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors;•customer- or government-supported efforts to influence Applied to conduct more or less of its operations and sourcing in a particular country;•variations among, and changes in, local, regional, national or international laws and regulations, including contract, intellectual property, cybersecurity, data privacy, labor, tax, and import/export laws, and the interpretation and application of such laws and regulations;•ineffective or inadequate legal protection of intellectual property rights in certain countries;•interruptions to Applied’s or its supplier’s supply chain;•the availability or increasing costs of raw material, commodity, energy and shipping or volatility in such costs;•delays or restrictions on personnel travel and in shipping materials or finished products between and within countries;•geographically diverse operations and projects, and our ability to maintain appropriate business processes, procedures and internal controls, and comply with environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption and other regulatory requirements;17Table of Contents•failure to effectively manage a diverse workforce with different experience levels, languages, cultures, customs, business practices and worker expectations, and differing employment practices and labor issues;•variations in the ability to develop relationships with local customers, suppliers and governments;•fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates, including the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, Israeli shekel, euro, Taiwanese dollar, Singapore dollar, Chinese yuan or Korean won;•the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations around the world;•performance of third-party providers of outsourced functions, including certain engineering, software development, manufacturing, information technology and other activities;•service interruptions from utilities, transportation, data hosting or telecommunications providers, or other events beyond our control;•impacts of climate change on the operations of Applied, its customers and suppliers;•challenges in hiring and integration of an increasing number of workers in new countries;•the increasing need for a mobile workforce to work in or travel to different regions; and•uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various countries, including for the manufacture and sale of semiconductors and displays in the developing economies of certain countries.Global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade policies and export regulations, including import and export license requirements, trade sanctions, tariffs and international trade disputes, have adversely impacted and could further adversely impact our business and operations, and reduce the competitiveness of our products relative to local and global competitors.We sell a significant majority of our products into jurisdictions outside of the United States including China, Taiwan, Japan and Korea. We also purchase a significant portion of equipment and supplies from suppliers outside of the United States. There is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships among the United States and the countries in which we conduct our business, that political, diplomatic, and national security factors can lead to global trade issues and changes in trade policies and export regulations, in particular, with respect to those affecting the semiconductor industry. The United States and other countries have imposed and may continue to impose new trade restrictions and export regulations, and have also levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods. Trade restrictions and export regulations, or increases in tariffs and additional taxes, including any retaliatory measures, can negatively impact end-user demand and customer investment in manufacturing equipment, increase our manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or prohibit our ability to sell products, provide services or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.For example, certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses, and our inability to obtain such licenses has limited and could further limit our markets and negatively impact our business. The U.S. government recently announced new export regulations for U.S. semiconductor technology sold in China, including wafer fabrication equipment and related parts and services, which have limited the market for certain of our products, adversely impacted our revenues, and increased our exposure to foreign competition. The U.S. Department of Commerce has promulgated rules and regulations expanding export license requirements for U.S. companies that sell certain products to entities in China whose actions or functions are intended to support military end uses, eliminated certain export license exceptions that applied to exports of certain items to China, added certain Chinese companies to its “Entity List” and “Unverified List,” making those companies subject to additional licensing requirements, and expanded licensing requirements for exports to China of items for use in the development or production of integrated circuits and certain technologies. These rules and regulations require us to obtain additional export licenses to supply certain of our products or provide services to certain customers in China. Obtaining export licenses may be difficult, costly and time-consuming, and there is no assurance that we will be issued licenses that we apply for on a timely basis or at all. Our inability to obtain such licenses could limit our markets in China, may cause us to be displaced by foreign businesses and competitors and adversely affect our results of operations. The implementation and interpretation of these rules and other regulatory actions taken by the U.S. government is uncertain and evolving, and may make it more challenging for Applied to manage its operations and forecast its operating results. The U.S. and other governmental agencies may in the future promulgate new or additional export licensing or other requirements that have the effect of further limiting the Company’s ability to provide certain of its products and services to customers outside the U.S., including China. These and other regulatory changes that may occur in the future could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.18Table of ContentsAs a global business with customers, suppliers and operations in many countries around the world, Applied may from time to time receive inquiries from government authorities about transactions between Applied and certain foreign entities. For example, in August 2022, Applied received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts requesting information relating to certain China customer shipments. We are cooperating fully with the government. These inquiries are subject to uncertainties, and we cannot predict the outcome of this inquiry, or any other governmental inquires or proceedings that may occur. Any violation or alleged violation of law or regulations could result in significant legal costs or in legal proceedings in which Applied or its employees could be subjected to fines and penalties and could result in restrictions on Applied’s business and damage to its reputation, and could have an adverse impact on its business operations, financial condition and results of operations.Furthermore, government authorities may take retaliatory actions, impose conditions that require the use of local suppliers or partnerships with local companies, require the license or other transfer of intellectual property, or engage in other efforts to promote local businesses and local competitors, which could have a significant adverse impact on Applied’s business. Many of these challenges are present in China and Korea, markets that represent a significant portion of Applied’s business.Applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base.Applied’s customer base is highly concentrated and has become increasingly so as a result of continued consolidation. Applied’s customer base is also geographically concentrated, particularly in China, Taiwan and Korea. A relatively limited number of manufacturers account for a substantial portion of Applied’s business. As a result, the actions of even a single customer or export regulations that apply to customers in certain countries, such as those in China, have exposed and can further expose Applied’s business and results of operations to greater volatility. The geographic concentration of Applied’s customer base could shift over time as a result of government policy and incentives to develop regional semiconductor industries. The mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, including as a result of changes in government policy, have varied and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year, and have had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on Applied’s net sales, gross margins and net income. Applied’s products are configured to customer specifications, and changing, rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant, non-recoverable costs. If customers do not place orders, or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel orders (including as a result of uncertain or adverse economic conditions, our inability to fulfill orders due to export regulations, shortage of parts, transportation capacity/interruptions or any other reason), Applied may not be able to replace the business, which may have a significant adverse impact on its results of operations and financial condition. The concentration of Applied’s customer base increases its risks related to the financial condition of its customers, and the deterioration in financial condition of a single customer or the failure of a single customer to perform its obligations could have a material adverse effect on Applied’s results of operations and cash flow. To the extent its customers experience liquidity constraints, Applied may incur bad debt expense, which may have a significant impact on its results of operations. Major customers may also seek pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to Applied, which may have a negative impact on Applied’s business, cash flow, revenue and gross margins.19Table of ContentsSupply chain disruptions, manufacturing interruptions or delays, or the failure to accurately forecast customer demand, could affect Applied’s ability to meet customer demand, lead to higher costs, or result in excess or obsolete inventory.Applied’s business depends on its timely supply of equipment, services and related products to meet the changing technical and volume requirements of its customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts, materials and services, including components and subassemblies, from suppliers and contract manufacturers. Significant and sudden increases in demand for Applied’s products, as well as worldwide demand for electronic products, have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a shortage of parts, materials and services needed to manufacture Applied’s products. Such shortages, as well as delays in and unpredictability of shipments due to transportation interruptions, have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our suppliers’ ability to meet our demand requirements. Difficulties in obtaining sufficient and timely supply of parts, materials or services, and delays in and unpredictability of shipments due to transportation interruptions, have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, Applied’s manufacturing operations and its ability to meet customer demand. Moreover, lockdowns that may from time to time be imposed in various geographic regions in response to periodic spikes in COVID-19 cases and related travel and logistics restrictions may result in additional supply chain and transportation disruptions, production delays, capacity limitations and cost increases. Our operating results may be adversely impacted if we are unable to obtain parts, materials or services needed to manufacture Applied’s products, or if we are unable to do so on a timely manner or on favorable terms. Ongoing supply chain constraints may continue to increase costs of logistics and parts for our products and may cause us to pass on increased costs to our customers. Such increase in costs may lead to reduced demand for our products and materially adversely impact our operating results. Some key parts are subject to long lead-times or available only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the countries where Applied conducts its manufacturing. Supply chain disruptions have caused and may continue to cause delays in our equipment production and delivery schedules, which can lead to our business performance becoming significantly dependent on quarter-end production and delivery schedules, and could have an adverse impact on our operating and financial results. Volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment can also increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for Applied and for companies throughout its supply chain, and may cause some suppliers to exit businesses, or scale back or cease operations, which could impact our ability to meet customer demand. Applied may also experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations, delays in its ability to deliver or install products or services, increased costs, customer order cancellations or reduced demand for its products as a result of:•global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade and export regulations, trade policies and sanctions, tariffs, and international trade disputes, including new and changing export regulations for certain exports to China, where a significant portion of Applied’s supply chain is located, and any retaliatory measures, that adversely impact Applied or its direct or sub-tier suppliers;•the failure or inability to accurately forecast demand and obtain sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective basis;•volatility in the availability and cost of parts, commodities, energy and shipping related to our products, including increased costs due to rising inflation or interest rates or other market conditions;•difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export licenses and approvals;•shipment delays due to transportation interruptions or capacity constraints;•a worldwide shortage of semiconductor components as a result of sharp increases in demand for semiconductor products in general;•information technology or infrastructure failures, including those of a third party supplier or service provider; and•natural disasters, the impacts of climate change, or other events beyond Applied’s control (such as earthquakes, utility interruptions, tsunamis, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, storms or extreme weather conditions, fires, regional economic downturns, regional or global health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical turmoil, increased trade restrictions between the U.S. and China and other countries, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war) in locations where it or its customers or suppliers have manufacturing, research, engineering or other operations.If a supplier fails to meet Applied’s requirements concerning quality, cost, intellectual property protection, socially-responsible business practices, or other performance factors, Applied may transfer its business to alternative sources. Transferring business to alternative suppliers could result in manufacturing delays, additional costs or other difficulties, and may impair Applied’s ability to protect, enforce and extract the full value of its intellectual property rights, as well as the intellectual property rights of its customers’ and other third parties. These outcomes could have an adverse impact on its business and competitive position and subject Applied to legal proceedings and claims. In addition, if Applied is unable to meet its customers’ demand for a prolonged period due to its inability to obtain certain parts or components from suppliers on a timely basis or at all, its business, results of operations and customer relationships could be adversely impacted.20Table of ContentsIn addition, if Applied needs to rapidly increase its business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules, this may strain Applied’s manufacturing and supply chain operations, and negatively impact Applied’s working capital. Moreover, if actual demand for Applied’s products is different than expected, Applied may purchase more or fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery of parts. If Applied purchases or commits to purchase inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize, or such inventory is rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, or if customers reduce, delay or cancel orders, Applied may incur excess or obsolete inventory charges.The continued effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and global measures taken in response have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, Applied’s operations and financial results.The continued effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken in response by governments and businesses worldwide to contain its spread have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact Applied’s supply chain, manufacturing, logistics, workforce and operations, as well as the operations of Applied’s customers, suppliers and partners globally. There is continued uncertainty regarding the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic, particularly with the emergence of new variants of COVID-19 and periodic spikes in COVID-19 cases in various geographic regions, and the impacts on our business and the global economy from the effects of the pandemic and response measures. Travel and logistics restrictions, lockdowns, vaccine requirements and other measures from time to time implemented by foreign and domestic authorities have resulted in, and may continue to result in, supply chain and transportation disruptions, production delays and capacity limitations at Applied and some of its customers, suppliers and partners, as well as reduced workforce availability or productivity at Applied and customer sites, and additional data, information and cyber security risks associated with an extensive workforce working remotely. As economic activity and business operations in certain regions recover, there have been and may continue to be periods of significant or sudden increases in demand for Applied’s products, as well as worldwide demand for electronic products. Significant or sudden demand increases have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a shortage of parts, materials or services needed to manufacture Applied’s products. We have also experienced, and may continue to experience, shipment delays due to transportation interruptions or capacity constraints. Such shortages or delays have adversely impacted, and could continue to adversely impact, our suppliers’ ability to meet our demand requirements and do so on favorable terms, and our ability to meet our customer demand. There can be no assurance that Applied or its suppliers will be able to maintain manufacturing operations at levels necessary to adequately address demand for Applied products. In addition, the pandemic and measures taken in response thereto have had, and may continue to have, a significant adverse impact on the global economic activity and could also result in a reduced demand for our products, delayed deliveries or installation, cancelled orders or increase in logistics and operating costs, and materially and adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The degree to which the pandemic ultimately impacts Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations and the global economy will depend on future developments beyond our control, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict, including the severity, duration and any resurgence of the pandemic, the extent, duration and effectiveness of periodic lockdowns and other containment actions, the availability, public adoption and efficacy of COVID vaccines, how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating activity can resume, and the severity and duration of resulting global economic volatility. Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industries in which it operates.The global semiconductor, display and related industries in which Applied operates are characterized by ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries that impact demand for and the profitability of Applied’s products and its consolidated results of operations, including:•the nature, timing and degree of visibility of changes in end demand for electronic products, including those related to fluctuations in consumer buying patterns tied to general economic conditions, seasonality or the introduction of new products, and the effects of these changes on customers’ businesses and on demand for Applied’s products;•increasing capital requirements for building and operating new fabrication plants and customers’ ability to raise the necessary capital;•trade, regulatory, tax or government incentive policies impacting the timing of customers’ investment in new or expanded fabrication plants;•differences in growth rates among the semiconductor, display and other industries in which Applied operates;•the increasing importance of establishing, improving and maintaining strong relationships with customers;•the increasing cost and complexity for customers to move from product design to volume manufacturing, which may slow the adoption rate of new manufacturing technology;•the need for customers to continually reduce the total cost of manufacturing system ownership;21Table of Contents•the heightened importance to customers of system reliability and productivity and the effect on demand for fabrication systems as a result of their increasing productivity, device yield and reliability;•manufacturers’ ability to reconfigure and re-use fabrication systems which can reduce demand for new equipment;•the increasing importance of, and difficulties in, developing products with sufficient differentiation to influence customers’ purchasing decisions;•requirements for shorter cycle times for the development, manufacture and installation of manufacturing equipment;•price and performance trends for semiconductor devices and displays, and the corresponding effect on demand for such products;•the increasing importance of the availability of spare parts to maximize the time that customers’ systems are available for production;•increasing government incentives for local suppliers;•the increasing role for and complexity of software in Applied products; and•the increasing focus on reducing energy usage and improving the environmental impact and sustainability associated with manufacturing operations.Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the semiconductor industry.The largest proportion of Applied’s consolidated net sales and profitability is derived from sales of manufacturing equipment in the Semiconductor Systems segment to the global semiconductor industry. In addition, a majority of the revenues of Applied Global Services is from sales to semiconductor manufacturers. The semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of Applied’s semiconductor manufacturing equipment and service products, including:•the increasing frequency and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, and Applied’s ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes;•the increasing cost of research and development due to many factors, including shrinking geometries, the use of new materials, new and more complex device structures, more applications and process steps, increasing chip design costs, and the increasing cost and complexity of integrated manufacturing processes;•the need to reduce product development time, despite the increasing difficulty of technical challenges;•the growing number of types and varieties of semiconductors and number of applications across multiple substrate sizes;•the increasing cost and complexity for semiconductor manufacturers to move more technically advanced capability and smaller geometries to volume manufacturing, and the resulting impact on the rates of technology transition and investment in capital equipment;•challenges in generating organic growth given semiconductor manufacturers’ levels of capital expenditures and the allocation of capital investment to market segments that Applied does not serve, such as lithography, or segments where Applied’s products have lower relative market presence;•customer investment in semiconductor manufacturing capabilities in China, which has been affected by changes in economic conditions and governmental regulations, including trade policies and export regulations; •the importance of increasing market positions in segments with growing demand;•semiconductor manufacturer’s ability to reconfigure and re-use equipment, resulting in diminished need to purchase new equipment and services from us, and challenges in providing parts for reused equipment;•shorter cycle times between order placements by customers and product shipment require greater reliance on forecasting of customer investment, which may lead to inventory write-offs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease gross margin;•competitive factors that make it difficult to enhance position, including challenges in securing development-tool-of-record (DTOR) and production-tool-of-record (PTOR) positions with customers;•consolidation in the semiconductor industry, including among semiconductor manufacturers and among manufacturing equipment suppliers;•shifts in sourcing strategies by computer and electronics companies, and manufacturing processes for advanced circuit technologies, that impact the equipment requirements of Applied’s foundry customers;22Table of Contents•the concentration of new wafer starts in Korea and Taiwan, where Applied’s service penetration and service-revenue-per-wafer-start have been lower than in other regions; •the increasing fragmentation of semiconductor markets, leading certain markets to become too small to support the cost of a new fabrication plant, while others require less technologically advanced products; and•the growing importance of specialty markets (such as Internet of Things, communications, automotive, power and sensors) that use mature process technologies and have a low barrier to entry.If Applied does not accurately forecast and allocate appropriate resources and investment towards addressing key technology changes and inflections, successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new technologies, and effectively address industry trends, its business and results of operations may be adversely impacted.Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the display industry.The global display industry historically has experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment investment levels, due in part to the limited number of display manufacturers, the concentrated nature of end-use applications, production capacity relative to end-use demand, and panel manufacturer profitability. Industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced TVs, and on demand for advanced smartphones and mobile device displays, which demand is highly sensitive to cost and improvements in technologies and features. The display industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of Applied’s display products and services, including:•the importance of new types of display technologies, such as organic light-emitting diode (OLED), low temperature polysilicon (LTPS) and metal oxide transistor backplanes, flexible displays, and new touch panel films;•the increasing cost of research and development, and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, and Applied’s ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes;•the timing and extent of an expansion of manufacturing facilities in China, which may be affected by changes in economic conditions and governmental regulations, including trade policies and export regulations;•the importance of increasing market positions in products and technologies with growing demand;•the rate of transition to larger substrate sizes for TVs and to new display technologies for TVs, information technology products and mobile applications, and the resulting effect on capital intensity in the industry and on Applied’s product differentiation, gross margin and return on investment; and•fluctuations in customer spending quarter over quarter and year over year for display manufacturing equipment, concentration of display manufacturer customers and their ability to successfully commercialize new products and technologies, and uncertainty with respect to future display technology end-use applications and growth drivers.If Applied does not successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new and emerging display technologies, or if industry demand for display manufacturing equipment and technologies slows, Applied’s business and its results of operations may be adversely impacted.The industries in which Applied operates are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market changes.Applied operates in a highly competitive environment in which innovation is critical, and its future success depends on many factors, including the development of new technologies and effective commercialization and customer acceptance of its equipment, services and related products, and its ability to increase its position in its current markets, expand into adjacent and new markets, and optimize operational performance. The development, introduction and support of a broadening set of products in a geographically diverse and competitive environment, and that may require greater collaboration with customers and other industry participants, have grown more complex and expensive over time. Furthermore, new or improved products may entail higher costs, longer development cycles, lower profits and may have unforeseen product design or manufacturing defects. To compete successfully, Applied must:•identify and address technology inflections, market changes, competitor innovations, new applications, customer requirements and end-use demand in a timely and effective manner;•develop new products and disruptive technologies, improve and develop new applications for existing products, and adapt products for use by customers in different applications and markets with varying technical requirements;•differentiate its products from those of competitors, meet customers’ performance specifications (including those related to energy consumption and environmental impact more broadly), appropriately price products, and achieve market acceptance;23Table of Contents•maintain operating flexibility to enable responses to changing markets, applications, customers and customer requirements;•enhance its worldwide operations across its businesses to reduce cycle time, enable continuous quality improvement, reduce costs, and enhance design for manufacturability and serviceability;•focus on product development and sales and marketing strategies that address customers’ high value problems and strengthen customer relationships;•effectively allocate resources between its existing products and markets, the development of new products, and expanding into new and adjacent markets;•improve the productivity of capital invested in R&D activities;•accurately forecast demand, work with suppliers and meet production schedules for its products;•improve its manufacturing processes and achieve cost efficiencies across product offerings;•adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different parts of the supply chain;•qualify products for evaluation and volume manufacturing with its customers; and •implement changes in its design engineering methodology to reduce material costs and cycle time, increase commonality of platforms and types of parts used in different systems, and improve product life cycle management.If Applied does not successfully anticipate technology inflections, develop and commercialize new products and technologies, and respond to changes in customer requirements and market trends, its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted.Applied is exposed to risks associated with expanding into new and related markets and industries.As part of its growth strategy, Applied seeks to expand into related or new markets and industries, either with its existing products or with new products developed internally, or those developed in collaboration with third parties, or obtained through acquisitions. Applied’s ability to successfully expand its business into new and related markets and industries may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:•the need to devote additional resources to develop new products for, and operate in, new markets;•the need to develop new sales and technical marketing strategies, cultivate relationships with new customers and meet different customer service requirements;•differing rates of profitability and growth among multiple businesses;•Applied’s ability to anticipate demand, capitalize on opportunities, and avoid or minimize risks;•the complexity of managing multiple businesses with variations in production planning, execution, supply chain management and logistics;•the adoption of new business models, business processes and systems;•the complexity of entering into and effectively managing strategic alliances or partnering opportunities;•new materials, processes and technologies;•the need to attract, motivate and retain employees with skills and expertise in these new areas;•new and more diverse customers and suppliers, including some with limited operating histories, uncertain or limited funding, evolving business models or locations in regions where Applied does not have, or has limited, operations;•new or different competitors with potentially more financial or other resources, industry experience and established customer relationships;•entry into new industries and countries, with differing levels of government involvement, laws and regulations, and business, employment and safety practices and requirements;•third parties’ intellectual property rights; and•the need to comply with, or work to establish, industry standards and practices.In addition, Applied from time to time receives funding from United States and other government agencies for certain strategic development programs to increase its research and development resources and address new market opportunities. As a condition to this government funding, Applied is often subject to certain record-keeping, audit, intellectual property rights-sharing, and/or other obligations.24Table of ContentsOperational and Financial RisksApplied is exposed to various risks related to protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights.Applied’s success depends in significant part on the protection of its technology using patents, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights. Infringement or misappropriation of Applied’s intellectual property rights, such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts, could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for Applied. Monitoring and detecting any unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult and costly and Applied cannot be certain that the protective measures it has implemented will completely prevent misuse. Applied’s ability to enforce its intellectual property rights is subject to litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the protection and enforceability of those rights in some countries. If Applied seeks to enforce its intellectual property rights, it may be subject to claims that those rights are invalid or unenforceable, and others may seek counterclaims against Applied, which could have a negative impact on its business. If Applied is unable to enforce and protect intellectual property rights, or if they are circumvented, rendered obsolete or invalidated by the rapid pace of technological change, or stolen or misappropriated by employees or third parties, it could have an adverse impact on its competitive position and business. In addition, changes in intellectual property laws or their interpretation may impact Applied’s ability to protect and assert its intellectual property rights, increase costs and uncertainties in the prosecution of patent applications or related enforcement actions, and diminish the value and competitive advantage conferred by Applied’s intellectual property assets.Third parties may also assert claims against Applied and its products. Claims that Applied’s products infringe the rights of others, whether or not meritorious, can be expensive and time-consuming to defend and resolve, and may divert the efforts and attention of management and personnel. The inability to obtain rights to use third party intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could have an adverse impact on Applied’s business. In addition, Applied may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets and other confidential business information. Any such incidents and claims could severely harm Applied’s business and reputation, result in significant expenses, harm its competitive position, and prevent Applied from selling certain products, all of which could have a significant adverse impact on Applied’s business and results of operations.Applied is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents.In the conduct of its business, Applied collects, uses, transmits and stores data on information technology systems, including systems owned and maintained by Applied or its third-party providers. These data include confidential information and intellectual property belonging to Applied or its customers or other business partners, as well as personal information of individuals. All information technology systems are subject to disruption, breach or failure. Applied and its third-party providers have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, cybersecurity incidents, some of which have been, and may continue to be, successful. These cybersecurity incidents may range from employee error or misuse or unauthorized use of information technology systems or confidential information, to individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to these information systems, to sophisticated cybersecurity attacks, known as advanced persistent threats, any of which may target the Company directly or indirectly through its third party providers and global supply chain. Globally, cybersecurity attacks are increasing in number and the attackers are increasingly organized and well-financed, or at times supported by state actors. In addition, geopolitical tensions or conflicts, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine or increasing tension with China, may create a heightened risk of cybersecurity attacks. Although no such cybersecurity incident has been material to the Company to date, Applied continues to devote significant resources to network security, data encryption, and other measures to protect its systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse, and it may be required to expend greater resources in the future, especially in the face of continuously evolving and increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity threats and privacy and data protection laws. Applied may be unable to anticipate, prevent or remediate future attacks, and in some instances Applied may be unaware of a cybersecurity incident or its magnitude and effects, particularly as attackers are becoming increasingly able to circumvent controls and remove forensic evidence. Depending on their nature and scope, cybersecurity incidents may result in business disruption, such as delay in the development and delivery of Applied’s products or disruption of Applied’s manufacturing processes, internal communications, interactions with customers and suppliers and processing and reporting financial results; the theft or misappropriation of intellectual property; corruption, loss of, or inability to access (e.g., through ransomware or denial of service) confidential information and critical data (i.e., that of Applied and its third party providers and customers); reputational damage; litigation or regulatory enforcement action related to contractual or regulatory privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, or other confidentiality obligations; diminution in the value of Applied’s investment in research, development and engineering; and increased costs associated with the implementation of cybersecurity measures to detect, deter, protect against, and recover from such incidents. Compliance with, and changes to, laws and regulations concerning privacy, cybersecurity, and data protection, including developing restrictions on cross-border data transfer, could result in significant expense, and any failure to comply could result in proceedings against Applied by regulatory authorities or other third parties. Further, customers and third-party providers increasingly demand rigorous contractual provisions regarding privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, confidentiality, and intellectual property, which may also increase our overall compliance burden.25Table of ContentsApplied is exposed to risks associated with business combinations, acquisitions, strategic investments and divestitures.Applied engages in acquisitions of or investments in companies, technologies or products in existing, related or new markets for Applied. Business combinations, acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks to Applied’s business, financial condition and operating results, including but not limited to:•inability to complete proposed transactions timely or at all due to the failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals, litigation or other disputes, and any ensuing obligation to pay a termination fee;•diversion of management’s attention and disruption of ongoing businesses;•the failure to realize expected revenues, gross and operating margins, net income and other returns from acquired businesses;•requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures and restrictions on the conduct of Applied’s existing business or the acquired business;•following completion of acquisitions, ineffective integration of businesses, operations, systems, digital and physical security, technologies, products, employees, compliance programs, changes in laws or regulations, including tax laws, or other factors, may impact the ability to realize anticipated synergies or other benefits;•failure to commercialize technologies from acquired businesses or developed through strategic investments;•dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;•inability to capitalize on characteristics of new markets that may be significantly different from Applied’s existing markets and where competitors may have stronger market positions and customer relationships;•failure to retain and motivate key employees of acquired businesses;•the potential impact of the announcement or consummation of a proposed transaction on relationships with third parties;•potential changes in Applied’s credit rating, which could adversely impact the Company’s access to and cost of capital;•reductions in cash balances or increases in debt obligations to finance activities associated with a transaction, which increase interest expense, and reductions in cash balances, which reduce the availability of cash flow for general corporate or other purposes, including share repurchases and dividends;•exposure to new operational risks, rules, regulations, worker expectations, customs and practices to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where Applied has not historically conducted business;•challenges associated with managing new, more diverse and more widespread operations, projects and people;•inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key technologies;•inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company’s internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, cybersecurity, privacy policies and compliance programs, or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices;•impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the segment;•the risk of litigation or claims associated with a proposed or completed transaction;•unknown, underestimated, undisclosed or undetected commitments or liabilities or non-compliance with laws, regulations or policies; and•the inappropriate scale of acquired entities’ critical resources or facilities for business needs.Applied also makes investments in other companies, including companies formed as joint ventures, which may decline in value or not meet desired objectives. The success of these investments depends on various factors over which Applied may have limited or no control and, particularly with respect to joint ventures, requires ongoing and effective cooperation with partners. In addition, new legislation, additional regulations or global economic or political conditions may affect or impair our ability to invest in certain countries or require us to obtain regulatory approvals to do so. Applied may not receive the necessary regulatory approvals or the approvals may come with significant conditions or obligations. The risks to Applied’s investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and, as a result, the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges.26Table of ContentsApplied continually assesses the strategic fit of its businesses and may from time to time seek to divest portions of its business that are not deemed to fit with its strategic plan. Some divestitures may take the form of Applied contributing assets to a joint venture, and thus are subject to the joint venture risks discussed above. In addition, divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties, such as ability to sell such businesses on satisfactory price and terms and in a timely manner (including long and costly sales processes and the possibility of lengthy and potentially unsuccessful attempts by a buyer to receive required regulatory approvals), or at all, disruption to other parts of the businesses and distraction of management, allocation of internal resources that would otherwise be devoted to completing strategic acquisitions, loss of key employees or customers, exposure to unanticipated liabilities (including, among other things, those arising from representations and warranties made to a buyer regarding the businesses) or ongoing obligations to support the businesses following such divestitures, and other adverse financial impacts.The ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital to Applied’s success.Applied’s success, competitiveness and ability to execute on its global strategies and maintain a culture of innovation depend in large part on its ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees and leaders with the necessary expertise and capabilities, representing diverse backgrounds and experiences. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, management or organizational changes, increasing competition for talent, the availability of qualified employees in the markets, availability of career development opportunities, the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries, and the attractiveness of Applied’s compensation and benefit programs, including its share-based programs, and Applied’s employment policies, including the flexibility of its remote-work arrangements. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, increasing costs to attract and retain needed talent, driven by macro-economic conditions and a highly competitive labor market. If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees and leaders, we may be unable to fully capitalize on current and new market opportunities, which could adversely impact Applied’s business and results of operations. The loss or retirement of employees presents particular challenges to the extent they involve the departure of knowledgeable and experienced employees and the resulting need to identify and train existing or new candidates to perform necessary functions, which may result in unexpected costs, reduced productivity, and/or difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls.Applied is exposed to risks associated with operating in jurisdictions with complex and changing tax laws.Applied is subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. Applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in applicable tax laws, interpretations of applicable tax laws, amount and composition of pre-tax income in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, and valuation of deferred tax assets. Beginning in fiscal 2023, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures currently and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize them over five or fifteen years. Although Congress is considering legislation that would defer the capitalization and amortization requirement, there is no assurance that the provision will be repealed or otherwise modified. If the requirement is not modified, it may increase Applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rates beginning in fiscal 2023.On August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act, which introduces a new 15% corporate minimum tax and includes an excise tax that would impose a 1% surcharge on stock repurchases, and which may impact Applied’s financial results beginning in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively.There have been a number of proposed changes in the tax laws that, if enacted, would increase our tax liability. While it is too early to predict the outcome of these proposals, if enacted, they could have a material impact on our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. An increase in Applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate could, in turn, have a material adverse impact on Applied’s results of operations and financial condition.Consistent with the international nature of its business, Applied conducts certain manufacturing, supply chain, and other operations in Asia, bringing these activities closer to customers and reducing operating costs. In certain foreign jurisdictions, conditional reduced income tax rates have been granted to Applied. To obtain the benefit of these tax incentives, Applied must meet requirements relating to various activities. Applied’s ability to realize benefits from these incentives could be materially affected if, among other things, applicable requirements are not met or Applied incurs net losses in these jurisdictions.In addition, Applied is subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and from time to time amends previously filed tax returns. Applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes, which requires estimates and judgments. Although Applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will agree with such estimates. Applied may have to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the estimates, which may be time-consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that Applied will be successful or that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in Applied’s historical income tax provisions and effective tax rates.27Table of ContentsApplied’s indebtedness and debt covenants could adversely affect its financial condition and business.Applied has $5.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding. Under the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes, it may be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon a change of control of Applied and a contemporaneous downgrade of the notes below investment grade. Applied also has in place a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. While no amounts were outstanding under this credit facility as of October 30, 2022, Applied may borrow amounts in the future under this credit facility. Applied may also enter into new financing arrangements. Applied’s ability to satisfy its debt obligations is dependent upon the results of its business operations and subject to other risks discussed in this section. Significant changes in Applied’s credit rating, disruptions in the global financial markets or changes in the interest rate environment could have a material adverse consequence on Applied’s access to and cost of capital for future financings, and financial condition. If Applied fails to satisfy its debt obligations, or comply with financial and other debt covenants, it may be in default and any borrowings may become immediately due and payable, and such default may also constitute a default under other of Applied’s obligations. There can be no assurance that Applied would have sufficient financial resources or be able to arrange financing to repay any borrowings at such time.The failure to successfully implement enterprise resource planning and other information systems changes could adversely impact Applied’s business and results of operations.Applied periodically implements new or enhanced enterprise resource planning and related information systems in order to better manage its business operations, align its global organizations and enable future growth. Implementation of new business processes and information systems requires the commitment of significant personnel, training and financial resources, and entails risks to Applied’s business operations. If Applied does not successfully implement enterprise resource planning and related information systems improvements, or if there are delays or difficulties in implementing these systems, Applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies, and may experience interruptions in service and operational difficulties, such as its ability to track orders, timely manufacture and ship products, project inventory requirements, effectively manage its supply chain and allocate human resources, aggregate financial data and report operating results, and otherwise effectively manage its business, all of which could result in quality issues, reputational harm, lost market and revenue opportunities, and otherwise adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Applied may incur impairment charges related to goodwill or long-lived assets.Applied has a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions. Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The review compares the fair value for each of Applied’s reporting units to its associated carrying value, including goodwill. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, declines in the market price of Applied common stock, changes in Applied’s strategies or product portfolio, and restructuring activities. Applied’s valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance. Applied may be required to record future charges to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets is determined to exist.Legal, Compliance, and Other RisksApplied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings, claims and investigations.Applied from time to time is, and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement, trade secret misappropriation, and other intellectual property rights, trade, including import, export and customs, antitrust, environmental regulations, privacy, data protection, securities, contracts, product performance, product liability, unfair competition, employment, workplace safety, and other matters. Applied also may receive, and has received, inquiries, warrants, subpoenas, and other requests for information in connection with government investigations of potential or suspected violations of law or regulations by Applied and/or its employees. Applied also on occasion receives notification from customers who believe that Applied owes them indemnification, product warranty or has other obligations related to claims made against such customers by third parties.Legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations, whether with or without merit, and internal investigations, may be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct; divert management’s attention and other Applied resources; inhibit Applied’s ability to sell its products; result in adverse judgments for damages, injunctive relief, penalties and fines; and negatively affect Applied’s business. There can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings, claims or investigations.28Table of ContentsApplied is exposed to various risks related to the global regulatory environment.As a public company with global operations, Applied is subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions, including those related to financial and other disclosures, accounting standards, corporate governance, intellectual property, tax, trade (including import, export and customs), antitrust, environment, health and safety (including those relating to climate change), employment, immigration and travel regulations, privacy, data protection and localization, and anti-corruption. Changing, inconsistent or conflicting laws, rules and regulations, and ambiguities in their interpretation and application create uncertainty and challenges, and compliance with laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive, divert management time and attention from revenue-generating activities, and otherwise adversely impact Applied’s business operations. Violations of law, rules and regulations, including, among others, those related to financial and other disclosures, trade, import and export regulations, antitrust, privacy, data protection, and anti-corruption, could result in fines, criminal penalties, restrictions on Applied’s business, and damage to its reputation, and could have an adverse impact on its business operations, financial condition and results of operations.Applied’s environmental, social and governance commitments could result in additional costs, and our inability to achieve them could have an adverse impact on our reputation and performance.From time to time Applied communicates its strategies, commitments and targets related to sustainability, carbon emissions, diversity and inclusion, human rights, and other environmental, social and governance matters. These strategies, commitments and targets reflect Applied’s current plans and aspirations, and Applied may be unable to achieve them. Changing customer sustainability requirements, as well as Applied’s sustainability targets, could cause Applied from time to time to alter its manufacturing, operations or equipment designs and processes, and incur substantial additional expense to meet such requirements and targets. Any failure to meet these sustainability requirements or targets could adversely impact the demand for Applied’s products and subject Applied to significant costs and liabilities and reputational risks that could adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, standards and processes for measuring and reporting carbon emissions and other sustainability metrics may change over time, and may result in inconsistent data, or could result in significant revisions to our strategies, commitments and targets, or our ability to achieve them. Any scrutiny of our carbon emissions or other sustainability disclosures or our failure to achieve related strategies, commitments and targets could negatively impact our reputation or performance.Applied is subject to risks associated with environmental, health and safety regulations.Applied is subject to environmental, health and safety regulations in connection with its global business operations, including but not limited to: regulations related to the development, manufacture, sale, shipping and use of its products; handling, discharge, recycling and disposal of hazardous materials used in its products or in producing its products; the operation of its facilities; and the use of its real property.

10,AMAT,APPLIED MATERIALS INC,2021-12-17,":      Risk Factors
The following risk factors could materially and adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition or results of operations and cause reputational harm, and should be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its business, in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report.Risks Related to the COVID-19 PandemicThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and global measures taken in response thereto have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, Applied’s operations and financial results.The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken in response by governments and businesses worldwide to contain its spread have adversely impacted and are expected to continue to adversely impact Applied’s supply chain, manufacturing, logistics, workforce and operations, as well as the operations of Applied’s customers, suppliers and partners globally. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic and the impacts on our business and the global economy from the effects of the ongoing pandemic and response measures. Travel and logistics restrictions, shelter-in-place orders and other measures, including working remotely, social distancing and other policies implemented in foreign and domestic sites, have resulted in, and are expected to continue to result in, transportation disruptions (such as reduced availability of air transport, port closures, and increased border controls or closures), production delays and capacity limitations at Applied and some of its customers, suppliers and partners, as well as reduced workforce availability or productivity at Applied and customer sites, and additional data, information and cyber security risks associated with an extensive workforce now working remotely full-time. While economic activity and business operations in certain regions continue to recover, there may be periods of significant or sudden increases in demand for Applied’s products, as well as worldwide demand for electronic products. Significant or sudden demand increases may result in a shortage of parts, materials or services needed to manufacture Applied’s products or may cause shipment delays due to transportation interruptions or capacity constraints. Such shortages or delays could adversely impact our suppliers’ ability to meet our demand requirements and our ability to meet our customer demand. There can be no assurance that Applied or its suppliers will be able to maintain manufacturing operations at current levels or at increased levels that may be necessary to address demand for Applied products. In addition, the pandemic and global measures taken in response thereto have had, and may continue to have a significant adverse impact on the global economic activity and could also result in a reduced demand for our products, delayed deliveries or installation, cancelled orders or increase in logistics and operating costs, and materially and adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The degree to which the ongoing pandemic ultimately impacts Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations and the global economy will depend on future developments beyond our control, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict, including the severity, duration and any resurgence of the pandemic, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, the availability, public adoption and efficacy of COVID vaccines, effectiveness of government stimulus programs, how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating activity can resume, and the severity and duration of the global economic volatility that results from the ongoing pandemic. Additionally, Applied has a multi-phase plan to return to working on-site, which gradually allows additional workers to return onsite while practicing social distancing and other safety measures. However, there is no assurance that such plan and safety measures will be effective in preventing the inadvertent transmission of COVID-19 within the workplace. Further, implementation of such plan could adversely impact Applied’s operations.Risks Associated with Operating a Global BusinessApplied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business.Applied has product development, engineering, manufacturing, sales and other operations distributed throughout many countries, and some of its business activities are concentrated in certain geographic areas. Moreover, in fiscal 2021, approximately 91% of Applied’s net sales were to customers in regions outside the United States. As a result of the global nature of its operations, Applied’s business performance and results of operations may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:•uncertain global economic and political business conditions and demands;•political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations and policies within countries that favor domestic companies over non-domestic companies, including customer- or government-supported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors;16Table of Contents•direct and indirect global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade policies, trade sanctions, tariffs, and international trade disputes, including the rules and interpretations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Commerce expanding export license requirements for certain products sold to certain entities in China;•customer- or government-supported efforts to influence Applied to conduct more of its operations and sourcing in a particular country, such as Korea and China;•variations among, and changes in, local, regional, national or international laws and regulations, including contract, intellectual property, cybersecurity, data privacy, labor, tax, and import/export laws, and the interpretation and application of such laws and regulations;•ineffective or inadequate legal protection of intellectual property rights in certain countries;•positions taken by governmental agencies regarding possible national commercial and/or security issues posed by international business operations;•fluctuating raw material, commodity, energy and shipping costs;•delays or restrictions in shipping materials or finished products between and within countries;•geographically diverse operations and projects, and our ability to maintain appropriate business processes, procedures and internal controls, and comply with environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption and other regulatory requirements;•supply chain interruptions, and service interruptions from utilities, transportation, data hosting or telecommunications providers, or other events beyond our control;•failure to effectively manage a diverse workforce with different experience levels, languages, cultures, customs, business practices and worker expectations, and differing employment practices and labor issues;•variations in the ability to develop relationships with local customers, suppliers and governments;•fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates, including the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, Israeli shekel, euro, Taiwanese dollar, Singapore dollar, Chinese yuan or Korean won;•the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations around the world;•performance of third-party providers of outsourced functions, including certain engineering, software development, manufacturing, information technology and other activities;•political instability, natural disasters, regional or global health epidemics, social unrest, terrorism or acts of war in locations where Applied has operations, suppliers or sales, or that may influence the value chain of the industries that Applied serves;•impacts of climate change on the operations of Applied, its customers and suppliers;•challenges in hiring and integration of an increasing number of workers in new countries;•the increasing need for a mobile workforce to work in or travel to different regions; and•uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various countries, including for the manufacture and sale of semiconductors and displays in the developing economies of certain countries.As more fully discussed in the risk factor “The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and global measures taken in response thereto have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, Applied’s operations and financial results” above, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken in response by governments and businesses worldwide to contain its spread have adversely impacted and are expected to continue to adversely impact Applied’s supply chain, manufacturing, logistics, workforce and operations, as well as the operations of Applied’s customers, suppliers and partners globally.17Table of ContentsInternational trade disputes could result in increases in tariffs and other trade restrictions and protectionist measures that could adversely impact our operations and reduce the competitiveness of our products relative to local and global competitors.We sell a significant majority of our products into countries outside of the United States including China, Taiwan, Japan and Korea. We also purchase a significant portion of equipment and supplies from suppliers outside of the United States. There is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships among the United States and the countries in which we conduct our business, that political, diplomatic and national security influences might lead to trade disputes, impacts and/or disruptions, in particular, with respect to those affecting the semiconductor industry. The United States and other countries have imposed and may continue to impose trade restrictions, and have also levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods. Increases in tariffs, additional taxes or other trade restrictions and retaliatory measures may increasingly impact end-user demand and customer investment in manufacturing equipment, increase our manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.For example, certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses, and our inability to obtain such licenses has limited and could further limit our markets and impact our business. The U.S. Department of Commerce has promulgated several rules and interpretations expanding export license requirements for U.S. companies that sell certain products to entities in China whose actions or functions are intended to support military end uses, eliminated certain export license exceptions that applied to exports of certain items to China, and added certain Chinese companies, including one of the Company’s customers, to its “entity list”. These rules and interpretations require us to obtain additional export licenses to supply certain of our products to such customer in China. Obtaining export licenses may be difficult, costly and time-consuming, and our inability to obtain such licenses could limit our markets in China and adversely affect our results of operations. The implementation and interpretation of these rules are ongoing and their impact on our business is uncertain, and these rules and other regulatory changes that have occurred and may occur in the future could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. The U.S. and other governmental agencies may in the future promulgate new or additional export licensing or other requirements that have the effect of further limiting the Company’s ability to provide certain of its products to customers outside the U.S., including China.In addition, government authorities may impose conditions that require the use of local suppliers or partnerships with local companies, require the license or other transfer of intellectual property, or engage in other efforts to promote local businesses and local competitors, which could have a significant adverse impact on Applied’s business. Many of these challenges are present in China and Korea, markets that represent a significant portion of Applied’s current business as well as long-term growth opportunities.Applied is exposed to risks associated with an uncertain global economy.Uncertain or adverse economic and business conditions, including uncertainties and volatility in the financial markets, national debt, fiscal or monetary concerns, inflation and rising interest rates in various regions, could materially adversely impact Applied’s operating results. Markets for semiconductors and displays depend largely on business and consumer spending and demand for electronic products. Uncertain or adverse economic and business conditions that result in decreases in consumer spending and demand or cause us to pass on increased costs to our customers may cause certain of our customers to push out, cancel or refrain from purchasing our equipment or services, which could materially adversely impact demand for our products and our operating results. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic, and transportation interruptions and other measures taken in response thereto, have had, and may continue to have, a significant adverse impact on the global and regional economic activity, as well as our ability to meet our customer demand.Similarly, changes that result in sudden increases in consumer demand for electronic products (for example, as a result of the reopening of the economy with the easing of COVID-19 related restrictions) have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a shortage of parts and materials needed to manufacture our products. Such shortages, as well as shipment delays due to transportation interruptions, have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our suppliers’ ability to meet our demand requirements. In addition, Lunar New Year and other holidays in the countries in which we or our suppliers operate may reduce the level of business activities during such times, and thus adversely impact our and our suppliers’ ability to manufacture and deliver products, supplies and services. Accelerated digital transformation may further increase consumer demand and exacerbate such shortages and also strain our manufacturing capacity, which may adversely impact our ability to meet customer demands and thus have an adverse impact on our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.Uncertain market conditions, difficulties in obtaining capital, or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, which can also result in lower sales, additional inventory or bad debt expense for Applied. Economic and industry uncertainty may similarly affect suppliers, which could impair their ability to deliver parts and negatively affect Applied’s ability to manage operations and deliver its products. These conditions may also lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect Applied’s ability to compete effectively.18Table of ContentsUncertain economic and industry conditions also make it more challenging for Applied to forecast its operating results, make business decisions, and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations. If Applied does not appropriately manage its business operations in response to changing economic and industry conditions, it could have a significant negative impact on its business performance and financial condition. Applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, which may adversely affect Applied’s ability to capitalize on opportunities. Even during periods of economic uncertainty or lower revenues, Applied must continue to invest in research and development and maintain a global business infrastructure to compete effectively and support its customers, which can have a negative impact on its operating margins and earnings.Applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. The risks to Applied’s investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate (including from impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic) and, as a result, the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio, as well as returns on pension assets, could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges. Applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations. If any of these financial institutions becomes insolvent, it could limit Applied’s ability to access cash in the affected accounts, which could affect its ability to manage its operations.Risks Associated with Applied’s IndustryThe industries that Applied serves can be volatile and difficult to predict.As a supplier to the global semiconductor and display and related industries, Applied is subject to variable industry conditions, since demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on several factors, including the nature and timing of technology inflections and advances in fabrication processes, the timing and requirements of new and emerging technologies and market drivers, production capacity relative to demand for chips and display technologies, end-user demand, customers’ capacity utilization, production volumes, access to affordable capital, consumer buying patterns and general economic conditions. Applied’s industries historically have been cyclical, and are subject to volatility and sudden changes in customer requirements for new manufacturing capacity and advanced technology. These changes can affect the timing and amounts of customer investments in technology and manufacturing equipment and can have a significant impact on Applied’s net sales, operating expenses, gross margins and net income. The amount and mix of capital equipment spending between different products and technologies can have a significant impact on Applied’s results of operations.To meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves, Applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity across its businesses, and may incur unexpected or additional costs to align its business operations. During periods of increasing demand for its products, Applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand; effectively manage its supply chain; attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees; and continue to control costs. During periods of decreasing demand, Applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions; effectively manage its supply chain; and motivate and retain key employees. If Applied does not effectively manage these challenges during periods of changing demand, including as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its effects, its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted. Even with effective allocation of resources and management of costs, during periods of decreasing demand, Applied’s gross margins and earnings may be adversely impacted.19Table of ContentsApplied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base.Applied’s customer base is highly concentrated and has become increasingly so as a result of continued consolidation. Applied’s customer base is also geographically concentrated, particularly in China, Taiwan and Korea. A relatively limited number of manufacturers account for a substantial portion of Applied’s business. As a result, the actions of even a single customer can expose Applied’s business and results of operations to greater volatility. The geographic concentration of Applied’s customer base could shift over time as a result of government policy and incentives to develop regional semiconductor industries. The mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, including as a result of changes in government policy, have varied and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year, and have had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on Applied’s net sales, gross margins and net income. Applied’s products are configured to customer specifications, and changing, rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant, non-recoverable costs. If customers do not place orders, or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel orders (including as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or our inability to fulfill orders due to a shortage of parts, transportation interruptions or any other reason), Applied may not be able to replace the business, which may have a significant adverse impact on its results of operations and financial condition. The concentration of Applied’s customer base increases its risks related to the financial condition of its customers, and the deterioration in financial condition of a single customer or the failure of a single customer to perform its obligations could have a material adverse effect on Applied’s results of operations and cash flow. To the extent its customers experience liquidity constraints, Applied may incur bad debt expense, which may have a significant impact on its results of operations. Major customers may also seek pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to Applied, which may have a negative impact on Applied’s business, cash flow, revenue and gross margins. Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industries in which it operates.The global semiconductor, display and related industries in which Applied operates are characterized by ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries that impact demand for and the profitability of Applied’s products and its consolidated results of operations, including:•the nature, timing and degree of visibility of changes in end demand for electronic products, including those related to fluctuations in consumer buying patterns tied to general economic conditions, seasonality or the introduction of new products, and the effects of these changes on customers’ businesses and on demand for Applied’s products;•increasing capital requirements for building and operating new fabrication plants and customers’ ability to raise the necessary capital;•trade, regulatory, tax or government incentive policies impacting the timing of customers’ investment in new or expanded fabrication plants;•differences in growth rates among the semiconductor, display and other industries in which Applied operates;•the increasing importance of establishing, improving and maintaining strong relationships with customers;•the increasing cost and complexity for customers to move from product design to volume manufacturing, which may slow the adoption rate of new manufacturing technology;•the need for customers to continually reduce the total cost of manufacturing system ownership;•the heightened importance to customers of system reliability and productivity and the effect on demand for fabrication systems as a result of their increasing productivity, device yield and reliability;•manufacturers’ ability to reconfigure and re-use fabrication systems which can reduce demand for new equipment;•the increasing importance of, and difficulties in, developing products with sufficient differentiation to influence customers’ purchasing decisions;•requirements for shorter cycle times for the development, manufacture and installation of manufacturing equipment;•price and performance trends for semiconductor devices and displays, and the corresponding effect on demand for such products;•the increasing importance of the availability of spare parts to maximize the time that customers’ systems are available for production;•increasing government incentives for local suppliers; •the increasing role for and complexity of software in Applied products; and•the increasing focus on reducing energy usage and improving the environmental impact and sustainability associated with manufacturing operations.20Table of ContentsApplied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the semiconductor industry.The largest proportion of Applied’s consolidated net sales and profitability is derived from sales of manufacturing equipment in the Semiconductor Systems segment to the global semiconductor industry. In addition, a majority of the revenues of Applied Global Services is from sales to semiconductor manufacturers. The semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of Applied’s semiconductor manufacturing equipment and service products, including:•the increasing frequency and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, and Applied’s ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes;•the increasing cost of research and development due to many factors, including shrinking geometries, the use of new materials, new and more complex device structures, more applications and process steps, increasing chip design costs, and the increasing cost and complexity of integrated manufacturing processes;•the need to reduce product development time, despite the increasing difficulty of technical challenges;•the growing number of types and varieties of semiconductors and number of applications across multiple substrate sizes;•the increasing cost and complexity for semiconductor manufacturers to move more technically advanced capability and smaller geometries to volume manufacturing, and the resulting impact on the rates of technology transition and investment in capital equipment;•challenges in generating organic growth given semiconductor manufacturers’ levels of capital expenditures and the allocation of capital investment to market segments that Applied does not serve, such as lithography, or segments where Applied’s products have lower relative market presence;•the importance of increasing market positions in segments with growing demand;•semiconductor manufacturer’s ability to reconfigure and re-use equipment, resulting in diminished need to purchase new equipment and services from us, and challenges in providing parts for reused equipment;•shorter cycle times between order placements by customers and product shipment require greater reliance on forecasting of customer investment, which may lead to inventory write-offs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease gross margin;•competitive factors that make it difficult to enhance position, including challenges in securing development-tool-of-record (DTOR) and production-tool-of-record (PTOR) positions with customers;•consolidation in the semiconductor industry, including among semiconductor manufacturers and among manufacturing equipment suppliers;•shifts in sourcing strategies by computer and electronics companies, and manufacturing processes for advanced circuit technologies, that impact the equipment requirements of Applied’s foundry customers;•the concentration of new wafer starts in Korea and Taiwan, where Applied’s service penetration and service-revenue-per-wafer-start have been lower than in other regions; •investment in semiconductor manufacturing capabilities in China, which may be affected by changes in economic conditions and governmental regulations and policies in China and the United States; •the increasing fragmentation of semiconductor markets, leading certain markets to become too small to support the cost of a new fabrication plant, while others require less technologically advanced products; and•the growing importance of specialty markets (such as Internet of Things, communications, automotive, power and sensors) that use mature process technologies and have a low barrier to entry.If Applied does not accurately forecast and allocate appropriate resources and investment towards addressing key technology changes and inflections, successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new technologies, and effectively address industry trends, its business and results of operations may be adversely impacted.21Table of ContentsApplied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the display industry.The global display industry historically has experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment investment levels, due in part to the limited number of display manufacturers, the concentrated nature of end-use applications, production capacity relative to end-use demand, and panel manufacturer profitability. Industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced TVs, and on demand for advanced smartphones and mobile device displays, which demand is highly sensitive to cost and improvements in technologies and features. The display industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of Applied’s display products and services, including:•the importance of new types of display technologies, such as organic light-emitting diode (OLED), low temperature polysilicon (LTPS) and metal oxide transistor backplanes, flexible displays, and new touch panel films;•the increasing cost of research and development, and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, and Applied’s ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes;•the timing and extent of an expansion of manufacturing facilities in China, which may be affected by changes in local economic conditions and governmental policies in China, Korea, Japan and the United States;•the importance of increasing market positions in products and technologies with growing demand;•the rate of transition to larger substrate sizes for TVs and to new display technologies for TVs, IT products and mobile applications, and the resulting effect on capital intensity in the industry and on Applied’s product differentiation, gross margin and return on investment; and•fluctuations in customer spending quarter over quarter and year over year for display manufacturing equipment, concentration of display manufacturer customers and their ability to successfully commercialize new products and technologies, and uncertainty with respect to future display technology end-use applications and growth drivers.If Applied does not successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new and emerging display technologies, or if industry demand for display manufacturing equipment and technologies slows, Applied’s business and its results of operations may be adversely impacted.The industries in which Applied operates are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market changes.Applied operates in a highly competitive environment in which innovation is critical, and its future success depends on many factors, including the development of new technologies and effective commercialization and customer acceptance of its equipment, services and related products, and its ability to increase its position in its current markets, expand into adjacent and new markets, and optimize operational performance. The development, introduction and support of a broadening set of products in a geographically diverse and competitive environment, and that may require greater collaboration with customers and other industry participants, have grown more complex and expensive over time. Furthermore, new or improved products may entail higher costs, longer development cycles, lower profits and may have unforeseen product design or manufacturing defects. To compete successfully, Applied must:•identify and address technology inflections, market changes, competitor innovations, new applications, customer requirements and end-use demand in a timely and effective manner;•develop new products and disruptive technologies, improve and develop new applications for existing products, and adapt products for use by customers in different applications and markets with varying technical requirements;•differentiate its products from those of competitors, meet customers’ performance specifications (including those related to energy consumption and environmental impact more broadly), appropriately price products, and achieve market acceptance;•maintain operating flexibility to enable responses to changing markets, applications, customers and customer requirements;•enhance its worldwide operations across its businesses to reduce cycle time, enable continuous quality improvement, reduce costs, and enhance design for manufacturability and serviceability;•focus on product development and sales and marketing strategies that address customers’ high value problems and strengthen customer relationships;•effectively allocate resources between its existing products and markets, the development of new products, and expanding into new and adjacent markets;•improve the productivity of capital invested in R&D activities;•accurately forecast demand, work with suppliers and meet production schedules for its products;22Table of Contents•improve its manufacturing processes and achieve cost efficiencies across product offerings;•adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different parts of the supply chain;•qualify products for evaluation and volume manufacturing with its customers; and •implement changes in its design engineering methodology to reduce material costs and cycle time, increase commonality of platforms and types of parts used in different systems, and improve product life cycle management.If Applied does not successfully anticipate technology inflections, develop and commercialize new products and technologies, and respond to changes in customer requirements and market trends, its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted.Risks Related to Applied’s Business, Finance and OperationsSupply chain disruptions, manufacturing interruptions or delays, or the failure to accurately forecast customer demand, could affect Applied’s ability to meet customer demand, lead to higher costs, or result in excess or obsolete inventory.Applied’s business depends on its timely supply of equipment, services and related products to meet the changing technical and volume requirements of its customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts, materials and services, including components and subassemblies, from suppliers and contract manufacturers. Significant and sudden increases in demand for Applied’s products, as well as worldwide demand for electronic products, have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a shortage of parts, materials and services needed to manufacture Applied’s products. Such shortages, as well as delays in and unpredictability of shipments due to transportation interruptions, have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our suppliers’ ability to meet our demand requirements. Difficulties in obtaining sufficient and timely supply of parts, materials or services, and delays in and unpredictability of shipments due to transportation interruptions, have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, Applied’s manufacturing operations and its ability to meet customer demand. Some key parts are subject to long lead-times or available only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the countries where Applied conducts its manufacturing. Volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment can increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for Applied and for companies throughout its supply chain, and may cause some suppliers to exit businesses, or scale back or cease operations, which could impact our ability to meet customer demand. Applied may also experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations, delays in its ability to deliver or install products or services, increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of:•the failure or inability to accurately forecast demand and obtain sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective basis;•volatility in the availability and cost of parts, materials or services, including rising prices due to inflation;•difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals;•shipment delays due to transportation interruptions or capacity constraints;•a worldwide shortage of semiconductor components as a result of sharp increases in demand for semiconductor products in general;•information technology or infrastructure failures, including those of a third party supplier or service provider; and•natural disasters, the impacts of climate change, or other events beyond Applied’s control (such as earthquakes, utility interruptions, tsunamis, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, storms or extreme weather conditions, fires, regional economic downturns, regional or global health epidemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical turmoil, increased trade restrictions between the U.S. and China and other countries, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war) in locations where it or its customers or suppliers have manufacturing, research, engineering or other operations.As more fully discussed in the risk factor “The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and global measures taken in response thereto have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, Applied’s operations and financial results” above, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken in response by governments and businesses worldwide to contain its spread have adversely impacted and are expected to continue to adversely impact Applied’s supply chain, manufacturing, logistics, workforce and operations, as well as the operations of Applied’s customers, suppliers and partners globally.23Table of ContentsIf a supplier fails to meet Applied’s requirements concerning quality, cost, intellectual property protection, socially-responsible business practices, or other performance factors, Applied may transfer its business to alternative sources. Transferring business to alternative suppliers could result in manufacturing delays, additional costs or other difficulties, and may impair Applied’s ability to protect, enforce and extract the full value of its intellectual property rights, as well as the intellectual property rights of its customers’ and other third parties. These outcomes could have an adverse impact on its business and competitive position and subject Applied to legal proceedings and claims. In addition, if Applied is unable to meet its customers’ demand for a prolonged period due to its inability to obtain certain parts or components from suppliers on a timely basis or at all, its business, results of operations and customer relationships could be adversely impacted. In addition, if Applied needs to rapidly increase its business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules, this may strain Applied’s manufacturing and supply chain operations, and negatively impact Applied’s working capital. Moreover, if actual demand for Applied’s products is different than expected, Applied may purchase more/fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery of parts. If Applied purchases or commits to purchase inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize, or such inventory is rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, or if customers reduce, delay or cancel orders, Applied may incur excess or obsolete inventory charges. Applied is exposed to risks associated with business combinations, acquisitions, strategic investments and divestitures.Applied engages in acquisitions of or investments in companies, technologies or products in existing, related or new markets for Applied. Business combinations, acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks to Applied’s business, financial condition and operating results, including but not limited to:•inability to complete proposed transactions timely or at all due to the failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals, litigation or other disputes, and any ensuing obligation to pay a termination fee;•diversion of management’s attention and disruption of ongoing businesses;•the failure to realize expected revenues, gross and operating margins, net income and other returns from acquired businesses;•requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures and restrictions on the conduct of Applied’s existing business or the acquired business;•following completion of acquisitions, ineffective integration of businesses, operations, systems, digital and physical security, technologies, products, employees, compliance programs, changes in laws or regulations, including tax laws, or other factors, may impact the ability to realize anticipated synergies or other benefits;•failure to commercialize technologies from acquired businesses or developed through strategic investments;•dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;•inability to capitalize on characteristics of new markets that may be significantly different from Applied’s existing markets and where competitors may have stronger market positions and customer relationships;•failure to retain and motivate key employees of acquired businesses;•the potential impact of the announcement or consummation of a proposed transaction on relationships with third parties;•potential changes in Applied’s credit rating, which could adversely impact the Company’s access to and cost of capital;•reductions in cash balances or increases in debt obligations to finance activities associated with a transaction, which increase interest expense, and reductions in cash balances, which reduce the availability of cash flow for general corporate or other purposes, including share repurchases and dividends;•exposure to new operational risks, rules, regulations, worker expectations, customs and practices to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where Applied has not historically conducted business;•challenges associated with managing new, more diverse and more widespread operations, projects and people;•inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key technologies;•inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company’s internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, cybersecurity, privacy policies and compliance programs, or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices;24Table of Contents•impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the segment;•the risk of litigation or claims associated with a proposed or completed transaction;•unknown, underestimated, undisclosed or undetected commitments or liabilities or non-compliance with laws, regulations or policies; and•the inappropriate scale of acquired entities’ critical resources or facilities for business needs.Applied also makes investments in other companies, including companies formed as joint ventures, which may decline in value or not meet desired objectives. The success of these investments depends on various factors over which Applied may have limited or no control and, particularly with respect to joint ventures, requires ongoing and effective cooperation with partners. In addition, new legislation, additional regulations or global economic or political conditions may affect or impair our ability to invest in certain countries or require us to obtain regulatory approvals to do so. Applied may not receive the necessary regulatory approvals or the approvals may come with significant conditions or obligations. The risks to Applied’s investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and, as a result, the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges.Applied continually assesses the strategic fit of its businesses and may from time to time seek to divest portions of its business that are not deemed to fit with its strategic plan. Some divestitures may take the form of Applied contributing assets to a joint venture, and thus are subject to the joint venture risks discussed above. In addition, divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties, such as ability to sell such businesses on satisfactory price and terms and in a timely manner (including long and costly sales processes and the possibility of lengthy and potentially unsuccessful attempts by a buyer to receive required regulatory approvals), or at all, disruption to other parts of the businesses and distraction of management, allocation of internal resources that would otherwise be devoted to completing strategic acquisitions, loss of key employees or customers, exposure to unanticipated liabilities (including, among other things, those arising from representations and warranties made to a buyer regarding the businesses) or ongoing obligations to support the businesses following such divestitures, and other adverse financial impacts.Applied is exposed to risks associated with expanding into new and related markets and industries.As part of its growth strategy, Applied seeks to expand into related or new markets and industries, either with its existing products or with new products developed internally, or those developed in collaboration with third parties, or obtained through acquisitions. Applied’s ability to successfully expand its business into new and related markets and industries may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:•the need to devote additional resources to develop new products for, and operate in, new markets;•the need to develop new sales and technical marketing strategies, cultivate relationships with new customers and meet different customer service requirements;•differing rates of profitability and growth among multiple businesses;•Applied’s ability to anticipate demand, capitalize on opportunities, and avoid or minimize risks;•the complexity of managing multiple businesses with variations in production planning, execution, supply chain management and logistics;•the adoption of new business models, business processes and systems;•the complexity of entering into and effectively managing strategic alliances or partnering opportunities;•new materials, processes and technologies;•the need to attract, motivate and retain employees with skills and expertise in these new areas;•new and more diverse customers and suppliers, including some with limited operating histories, uncertain or limited funding, evolving business models or locations in regions where Applied does not have, or has limited, operations;•new or different competitors with potentially more financial or other resources, industry experience and established customer relationships;•entry into new industries and countries, with differing levels of government involvement, laws and regulations, and business, employment and safety practices;•third parties’ intellectual property rights; and•the need to comply with, or work to establish, industry standards and practices.25Table of ContentsIn addition, Applied from time to time receives funding from United States and other government agencies for certain strategic development programs to increase its research and development resources and address new market opportunities. As a condition to this government funding, Applied is often subject to certain record-keeping, audit, intellectual property rights-sharing, and/or other obligations.The ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital to Applied’s success.Applied’s success, competitiveness and ability to execute on its global strategies and maintain a culture of innovation depend in large part on its ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees and leaders with expertise and capabilities, representing diverse backgrounds and experiences. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, management changes, Applied’s organizational structure, increasing local and global competition for talent, the availability of qualified employees in the local and global markets, cost reduction activities (including workforce reductions and unpaid shutdowns), availability of career development opportunities, the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries, and the attractiveness of Applied’s compensation and benefit programs, including its share-based programs. If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees and leaders, we may be unable to fully capitalize on current and new market opportunities, which could adversely impact Applied’s business and results of operations. The loss or retirement of employees presents particular challenges to the extent they involve the departure of knowledgeable and experienced employees and the resulting need to identify and train existing or new candidates to perform necessary functions, which may result in unexpected costs, reduced productivity, and/or difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls.Applied is exposed to risks associated with operating in jurisdictions with complex and changing tax laws.Applied is subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. Applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in applicable tax laws, interpretations of applicable tax laws, amount and composition of pre-tax income in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, and valuation of deferred tax assets. There have been a number of proposed changes in the tax laws that, if enacted, would increase our tax liability. While it is too early to predict the outcome of these proposals, if enacted, they could have a material impact on our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. An increase in Applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate could, in turn, have a material adverse impact on Applied’s results of operations and financial condition.Consistent with the international nature of its business, Applied conducts certain manufacturing, supply chain, and other operations in Asia, bringing these activities closer to customers and reducing operating costs. In certain foreign jurisdictions, conditional reduced income tax rates have been granted to Applied. To obtain the benefit of these tax incentives, Applied must meet requirements relating to various activities. Applied’s ability to realize benefits from these incentives could be materially affected if, among other things, applicable requirements are not met or Applied incurs net losses in these jurisdictions.In addition, Applied is subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and from time to time amends previously filed tax returns. Applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes, which requires estimates and judgments. Although Applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will agree with such estimates. Applied may have to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the estimates, which may be time-consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that Applied will be successful or that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in Applied’s historical income tax provisions and effective tax rates.Applied’s indebtedness and debt covenants could adversely affect its financial condition and business.Applied has $5.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding. Under the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes, it may be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon a change of control of Applied and a contemporaneous downgrade of the notes below investment grade. Applied also has in place a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. While no amounts were outstanding under this credit facility as of October 31, 2021, Applied may borrow amounts in the future under this credit facility. Applied may also enter into new financing arrangements. Applied’s ability to satisfy its debt obligations is dependent upon the results of its business operations and subject to other risks discussed in this section. Significant changes in Applied’s credit rating, disruptions in the global financial markets or changes in the interest rate environment could have a material adverse consequence on Applied’s access to and cost of capital for future financings, and financial condition. If Applied fails to satisfy its debt obligations, or comply with financial and other debt covenants, it may be in default and any borrowings may become immediately due and payable, and such default may also constitute a default under other of Applied’s obligations. There can be no assurance that Applied would have sufficient financial resources or be able to arrange financing to repay any borrowings at such time. 26Table of ContentsThe failure to successfully implement enterprise resource planning and other information systems changes could adversely impact Applied’s business and results of operations.Applied periodically implements new or enhanced enterprise resource planning and related information systems in order to better manage its business operations, align its global organizations and enable future growth. Implementation of new business processes and information systems requires the commitment of significant personnel, training and financial resources, and entails risks to Applied’s business operations. If Applied does not successfully implement enterprise resource planning and related information systems improvements, or if there are delays or difficulties in implementing these systems, Applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies, and may experience interruptions in service and operational difficulties, such as its ability to track orders, timely manufacture and ship products, project inventory requirements, effectively manage its supply chain and allocate human resources, aggregate financial data and report operating results, and otherwise effectively manage its business, all of which could result in quality issues, reputational harm, lost market and revenue opportunities, and otherwise adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Applied may incur impairment charges related to goodwill or long-lived assets.Applied has a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions. Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The review compares the fair value for each of Applied’s reporting units to its associated carrying value, including goodwill. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, declines in the market price of Applied common stock, changes in Applied’s strategies or product portfolio, and restructuring activities. Applied’s valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance. Applied may be required to record future charges to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets is determined to exist.Risks Related to Intellectual Property and CybersecurityApplied is exposed to various risks related to protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights.Applied’s success depends in significant part on the protection of its technology using patents, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights. Infringement of Applied’s rights by a third party, such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts, could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for Applied. Monitoring and detecting any unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult and costly and Applied cannot be certain that the protective measures it has implemented will completely prevent misuse. Applied’s ability to enforce its intellectual property rights is subject to litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the protection and enforceability of those rights in some countries. If Applied seeks to enforce its intellectual property rights, it may be subject to claims that those rights are invalid or unenforceable, and others may seek counterclaims against Applied, which could have a negative impact on its business. If Applied is unable to enforce and protect intellectual property rights, or if they are circumvented, rendered obsolete or invalidated by the rapid pace of technological change, it could have an adverse impact on its competitive position and business. In addition, changes in intellectual property laws or their interpretation may impact Applied’s ability to protect and assert its intellectual property rights, increase costs and uncertainties in the prosecution of patent applications or related enforcement actions, and diminish the value and competitive advantage conferred by Applied’s intellectual property assets.Third parties may also assert claims against Applied and its products. Claims that Applied’s products infringe the rights of others, whether or not meritorious, can be expensive and time-consuming to defend and resolve, and may divert the efforts and attention of management and personnel. The inability to obtain rights to use third party intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could have an adverse impact on Applied’s business. In addition, Applied may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets and other confidential business information. Any such incidents and claims could severely harm Applied’s business and reputation, result in significant expenses, harm its competitive position, and prevent Applied from selling certain products, all of which could have a significant adverse impact on Applied’s business and results of operations.27Table of ContentsApplied is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents.In the conduct of its business, Applied collects, uses, transmits and stores data on information technology systems, including systems owned and maintained by Applied or its third-party providers. These data include confidential information and intellectual property belonging to Applied or its customers or other business partners, as well as personal information of individuals. All information technology systems are subject to disruption, breach or failure. Applied and its third-party providers have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, cybersecurity incidents, some of which may be successful. These cybersecurity incidents may range from employee error or misuse, to individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to these information systems, to sophisticated cybersecurity attacks, known as advanced persistent threats, any of which may target the Company directly or indirectly through its third party providers and global supply chain. Although no such cybersecurity incident has been material to the Company to date, Applied continues to devote significant resources to network security, data encryption, and other measures to protect its systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse, and it may be required to expend greater resources in the future, especially in the face of continuously evolving cybersecurity threats and privacy and data protection laws. Depending on their nature and scope, cybersecurity incidents may result in business disruption, such as delay in the development and delivery of Applied’s products or disruption of Applied’s manufacturing processes; the misappropriation of intellectual property; corruption, loss of, or inability to access (e.g., through ransomware or denial of service) confidential information and critical data (i.e., that of Applied and its third party providers and customers); reputational damage; litigation or regulatory enforcement action related to contractual or regulatory privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, or other confidentiality obligations; diminution in the value of Applied’s investment in research, development and engineering; and increased costs associated with the implementation of cybersecurity measures to detect, deter, protect against, and recover from such incidents. Compliance with, and changes to, laws and regulations concerning privacy, cybersecurity, data protection and data localization could result in significant expense, and any failure to comply could result in proceedings against Applied by regulatory authorities or other third parties. Further, customers and third-party providers increasingly demand rigorous contractual provisions regarding privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, confidentiality, and intellectual property, which may also increase our overall compliance burden. Risks Related to Legal and ComplianceApplied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings.Applied from time to time is, and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement, trade secret misappropriation, and other intellectual property rights, trade, including import, export and customs, antitrust, environmental regulations, privacy, data protection, securities, contracts, product performance, product liability, unfair competition, employment, workplace safety, and other matters. Applied also on occasion receives notification from customers who believe that Applied owes them indemnification, product warranty or has other obligations related to claims made against such customers by third parties.Legal proceedings and claims, whether with or without merit, and associated internal investigations, may be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct; divert management’s attention and other Applied resources; inhibit Applied’s ability to sell its products; result in adverse judgments for damages, injunctive relief, penalties and fines; and negatively affect Applied’s business. There can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings, claims or investigations.Applied is subject to risks associated with environmental, health and safety regulations and sustainability requirements.Applied is subject to environmental, health and safety regulations in connection with its global business operations, including but not limited to: regulations related to the development, manufacture, shipping and use of its products; handling, discharge, recycling and disposal of hazardous materials used in its products or in producing its products; the operation of its facilities; and the use of its real property. The failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental, health and safety regulations, including those relating to climate change, could result in: significant remediation or other legal liabilities; the imposition of penalties and fines; restrictions on the development, manufacture, sale, shipping or use of certain of its products; limitations on the operation of its facilities or ability to use its real property; and a decrease in the value of its real property. In addition to regulatory compliance, growing customer sustainability requirements, as well as Applied’s sustainability targets, could cause Applied from time to time to alter its manufacturing, operations or equipment designs, and incur substantial expense to meet these regulatory and sustainability requirements. Any failure to comply with these regulations, or meet these customer requirements or sustainability targets, could adversely impact the demand for Applied’s products and subject Applied to significant costs and liabilities and reputational risks that could adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations.28Table of ContentsApplied is exposed to various risks related to the global regulatory environment.As a public company with global operations, Applied is subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions, including those related to financial and other disclosures, accounting standards, corporate governance, intellectual property, tax, trade (including import, export and customs), antitrust, environment, health and safety (including those relating to climate change), employment, immigration and travel regulations, privacy, data protection and localization, and anti-corruption. Changing, inconsistent or conflicting laws, rules and regulations, and ambiguities in their interpretation and application create uncertainty and challenges, and compliance with laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive, divert management time and attention from revenue-generating activities, and otherwise adversely impact Applied’s business operations. Violations of law, rules and regulations, including, among others, those related to financial and other disclosures, trade and import, antitrust, privacy, data protection, and anti-corruption, could result in fines, criminal penalties, restrictions on Applied’s business, and damage to its reputation, and could have an adverse impact on its business operations, financial condition and results of operations"
16,AMAT,APPLIED MATERIALS INC,2020-12-11,":      Risk Factors
The following risk factors could materially and adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition or results of operations and cause reputational harm, and should be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its business, in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report.Risks Related to the COVID-19 PandemicThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and global measures taken in response thereto have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, Applied’s operations and financial results.The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken in response by governments and businesses worldwide to contain its spread, including quarantines, facility closures, travel and logistics restrictions, border controls, and shelter in place or stay at home and social distancing orders, have adversely impacted and are expected to continue to adversely impact Applied’s supply chain, manufacturing, logistics, workforce and operations, as well as the operations of Applied’s customers, suppliers and partners globally. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic and the impacts on our business and the global economy from the effects of the ongoing pandemic and response measures. While Applied continues to see progress in the recovery within its supply chain, travel and logistics restrictions, shelter-in-place orders and other measures, including working remotely, social distancing and other policies implemented in foreign and domestic sites to protect the health and safety of employees, have resulted in, and are expected to continue to result in, transportation disruptions (such as reduced availability of air transport, port closures, and increased border controls or closures), production delays and capacity limitations at Applied and some of its customers, suppliers and partners, as well as reduced workforce availability or productivity at Applied and customer sites, and additional data, information and cyber security risks associated with an extensive workforce now working remotely full-time. There can be no assurance that Applied or its suppliers will be able to maintain manufacturing operations at current levels. In addition, the pandemic and the impact of the foregoing measures in various forms and in varying degrees have had, and may continue to have a significant adverse impact on the global economic activity and could also result in a reduced demand for our products, delayed deliveries or installation, cancelled orders or increase in logistics and operating costs, and materially adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The degree to which the pandemic ultimately impacts Applied’s financial condition and results of operations and the global economy will depend on future developments beyond our control, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict, including the severity and duration of the pandemic, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, availability of effective vaccines against COVID-19, effectiveness of government stimulus programs, resurgence of COVID-19, how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating activity can resume, and the severity and duration of the global economic downturn that results from the pandemic. Risks Associated with Operating a Global BusinessApplied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business.Applied has product development, engineering, manufacturing, sales and other operations distributed throughout many countries, and some of its business activities are concentrated in certain geographic areas. Moreover, in fiscal 2020, approximately 90% of Applied’s net sales were to customers in regions outside the United States. As a result of the global nature of its operations, Applied’s business performance and results of operations may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:•uncertain global economic and political business conditions and demands;•political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations and policies within countries that favor domestic companies over non-domestic companies, including customer- or government-supported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors;•direct and indirect global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade policies (including the impact of the implementation and interpretation of the rules published by the U.S. Department of Commerce on April 28, 2020 and August 17, 2020 relating to certain export license requirements and the ability to obtain required import and export licenses), trade sanctions, tariffs, and international trade disputes;•customer- or government-supported efforts to influence Applied to conduct more of its operations and sourcing in a particular country, such as Korea and China;•variations among, and changes in, local, regional, national or international laws and regulations, including contract, intellectual property, cybersecurity, data privacy, labor, tax, and import/export laws, and the interpretation and application of such laws and regulations;16Table of Contents•ineffective or inadequate legal protection of intellectual property rights in certain countries;•positions taken by governmental agencies regarding possible national commercial and/or security issues posed by international business operations;•fluctuating raw material, commodity, energy and shipping costs;•delays or restrictions in shipping materials or finished products between and within countries;•geographically diverse operations and projects, and our ability to maintain appropriate business processes, procedures and internal controls, and comply with environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption and other regulatory requirements;•supply chain interruptions, and service interruptions from utilities, transportation, data hosting or telecommunications providers, or other events beyond our control;•failure to effectively manage a diverse workforce with different experience levels, languages, cultures, customs, business practices and worker expectations, and differing employment practices and labor issues;•variations in the ability to develop relationships with local customers, suppliers and governments;•fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates, including the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, Israeli shekel, euro, Taiwanese dollar, Singapore dollar, Chinese yuan or Korean won;•the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations around the world;•performance of third party providers of outsourced functions, including certain engineering, software development, manufacturing, information technology and other activities;•political instability, natural disasters, regional or global health epidemics, social unrest, terrorism or acts of war in locations where Applied has operations, suppliers or sales, or that may influence the value chain of the industries that Applied serves;•challenges in hiring and integration of an increasing number of workers in new countries;•the increasing need for a mobile workforce to work in or travel to different regions; and•uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various countries, including for the manufacture and sale of semiconductors and displays in the developing economies of certain countries.As more fully discussed in the risk factor “The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and global measures taken in response thereto have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, Applied’s operations and financial results” above, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken in response by governments and businesses worldwide to contain its spread, including quarantines, facility closures, travel and logistics restrictions, border controls, and shelter in place or stay at home and social distancing orders, have adversely impacted and are expected to continue to adversely impact Applied’s supply chain, manufacturing, logistics, workforce and operations, as well as the operations of Applied’s customers, suppliers and partners globally.17Table of ContentsInternational trade disputes could result in increases in tariffs and other trade restrictions and protectionist measures that could adversely impact our operations and reduce the competitiveness of our products relative to local and global competitors.We sell a significant majority of our products into countries outside of the United States including China, Taiwan, Japan and Korea. We also purchase a significant portion of equipment and supplies from suppliers outside of the United States. There is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships among China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea and the United States, that political, diplomatic and national security influences might lead to trade disputes, impacts and/or disruptions, in particular, with respect to those affecting the semiconductor industry. The United States and other countries have imposed and may continue to impose trade restrictions, and have also levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods. Increases in tariffs, additional taxes or other trade restrictions and retaliatory measures may increasingly impact end-user demand and customer investment in manufacturing equipment, increase our manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.Certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses, and our inability to obtain such licenses have limited and could further limit our markets and impact our business. For example, on April 28, 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce published rules, which became effective on June 29, 2020, that expanded export license requirements for U.S. companies that sell certain products to entities in China whose actions or functions are intended to support military end uses, and eliminated certain export license exceptions that applied to exports of certain items to China. On September 25, 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce designated a certain customer in China as a military end user. These trade restrictions and their interpretation by the U.S. Department of Commerce require us to apply for additional export licenses for certain of our products sold to certain customers in China, including products sold to customers that the U.S. Department of Commerce has determined to present a risk of diversion to a military end use. Obtaining export licenses may be difficult, costly and time-consuming, and our inability to obtain such licenses could limit our markets in China and adversely affect our results of operations. The implementation and interpretation of these rules are ongoing and their impact on our business is uncertain, and these rules and other regulatory changes that have occurred and may occur in the future could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, on August 17, 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce published a final rule that does not impose additional license requirements for the export of Applied’s products but could require certain of Applied’s customers to obtain licenses for the export of wafers, chipsets and certain related items to Huawei or its affiliates that are the direct product of US-origin semiconductor manufacturing equipment and thus could potentially limit the demand for certain of Applied’s products from such customers. In addition, government authorities may impose conditions that require the use of local suppliers or partnerships with local companies, require the license or other transfer of intellectual property, or engage in other efforts to promote local businesses and local competitors, which could have a significant adverse impact on Applied’s business. Many of these challenges are present in China and Korea, markets that represent a significant portion of Applied’s current business as well as long-term growth opportunities.Applied is exposed to risks associated with an uncertain global economy.Uncertain global economic and business conditions, along with uncertainties and volatility in the financial markets, national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions, pose challenges to the industries in which Applied operates. Markets for semiconductors and displays depend largely on business and consumer spending and demand for electronic products. Economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain Applied customers to push out, cancel, or refrain from purchasing for equipment or services, which may have an adverse impact on Applied’s revenues, results of operations and financial condition. Uncertain market conditions, difficulties in obtaining capital, or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, which can also result in lower sales, additional inventory or bad debt expense for Applied. Economic and industry uncertainty may similarly affect suppliers, which could impair their ability to deliver parts and negatively affect Applied’s ability to manage operations and deliver its products. These conditions may also lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect Applied’s ability to compete effectively.In particular, impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in increased volatility in global financial markets, increases in levels of unemployment, and economic uncertainty, and may lead to significant negative impacts on customer spending, demand for our products, the ability of our customers to pay, our financial condition and the financial condition of our suppliers.18Table of ContentsUncertain economic and industry conditions also make it more challenging for Applied to forecast its operating results, make business decisions, and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations. If Applied does not appropriately manage its business operations in response to changing economic and industry conditions, it could have a significant negative impact on its business performance and financial condition. Applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, which may adversely affect Applied’s ability to capitalize on opportunities. Even during periods of economic uncertainty or lower revenues, Applied must continue to invest in research and development and maintain a global business infrastructure to compete effectively and support its customers, which can have a negative impact on its operating margins and earnings.Applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. The risks to Applied’s investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate (including from impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic) and, as a result, the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio, as well as returns on pension assets, could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges. Applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations. If any of these financial institutions becomes insolvent, it could limit Applied’s ability to access cash in the affected accounts, which could affect its ability to manage its operations.Risks Associated with Applied’s IndustryThe industries that Applied serves can be volatile and difficult to predict.As a supplier to the global semiconductor and display and related industries, Applied is subject to variable industry conditions, since demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on several factors, including the nature and timing of technology inflections and advances in fabrication processes, the timing and requirements of new and emerging technologies and market drivers, production capacity relative to demand for chips and display technologies, end-user demand, customers’ capacity utilization, production volumes, access to affordable capital, consumer buying patterns and general economic conditions. Applied’s industries historically have been cyclical, and are subject to volatility and sudden changes in customer requirements for new manufacturing capacity and advanced technology. These changes can affect the timing and amounts of customer investments in technology and manufacturing equipment and can have a significant impact on Applied’s net sales, operating expenses, gross margins and net income. The amount and mix of capital equipment spending between different products and technologies can have a significant impact on Applied’s results of operations.To meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves, Applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity across its businesses, and may incur unexpected or additional costs to align its business operations. During periods of increasing demand for its products, Applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand; effectively manage its supply chain; attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees; and continue to control costs. During periods of decreasing demand, Applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions; effectively manage its supply chain; and motivate and retain key employees. If Applied does not effectively manage these challenges during periods of changing demand, including as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its effects, its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted. Even with effective allocation of resources and management of costs, during periods of decreasing demand, Applied’s gross margins and earnings may be adversely impacted.Applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base.Applied’s customer base is highly concentrated, and has become increasingly so as a result of continued consolidation. Applied’s customer base is also geographically concentrated, particularly in China, Taiwan and Korea. A relatively limited number of manufacturers account for a substantial portion of Applied’s business. As a result, the actions of even a single customer can expose Applied’s business and results of operations to greater volatility. The mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, including as a result of changes in government policy, have varied and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year, and have a significant impact on Applied’s net sales, gross margins and net income. Applied’s products are configured to customer specifications, and changing, rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant, non-recoverable costs. If customers do not place orders, or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel orders (including as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), Applied may not be able to replace the business, which may have a significant adverse impact on its results of operations and financial condition. The concentration of Applied’s customer base increases its risks related to the financial condition of its customers, and the deterioration in financial condition of a single customer or the failure of a single customer to perform its obligations could have a material adverse effect on Applied’s results of operations and cash flow. To the extent its customers experience liquidity constraints, Applied may incur additional bad debt expense, which may have a significant impact on its results of operations. Major customers may also seek pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to Applied, which may have a negative impact on Applied’s business, cash flow, revenue and gross margins. 19Table of ContentsApplied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industries in which it operates.The global semiconductor, display and related industries in which Applied operates are characterized by ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries that impact demand for and the profitability of Applied’s products and its consolidated results of operations, including:•the nature, timing and degree of visibility of changes in end demand for electronic products, including those related to fluctuations in consumer buying patterns tied to seasonality or the introduction of new products, and the effects of these changes on customers’ businesses and on demand for Applied’s products;•increasing capital requirements for building and operating new fabrication plants and customers’ ability to raise the necessary capital;•trade, regulatory or tax policies impacting the timing of customers’ investment in new or expanded fabrication plants;•differences in growth rates among the semiconductor, display and other industries in which Applied operates;•the increasing importance of establishing, improving and maintaining strong relationships with customers;•the increasing cost and complexity for customers to move from product design to volume manufacturing, which may slow the adoption rate of new manufacturing technology;•the need for customers to continually reduce the total cost of manufacturing system ownership;•the heightened importance to customers of system reliability and productivity and the effect on demand for fabrication systems as a result of their increasing productivity, device yield and reliability;•manufacturers’ ability to reconfigure and re-use fabrication systems which can reduce demand for new equipment;•the increasing importance of, and difficulties in, developing products with sufficient differentiation to influence customers’ purchasing decisions;•requirements for shorter cycle times for the development, manufacture and installation of manufacturing equipment;•price and performance trends for semiconductor devices and displays, and the corresponding effect on demand for such products;•the increasing importance of the availability of spare parts to maximize the time that customers’ systems are available for production;•the increasing role for and complexity of software in Applied products; and•the increasing focus on reducing energy usage and improving the environmental impact and sustainability associated with manufacturing operations.Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the semiconductor industry.The largest proportion of Applied’s consolidated net sales and profitability is derived from sales of manufacturing equipment in the Semiconductor Systems segment to the global semiconductor industry. In addition, a majority of the revenues of Applied Global Services is from sales to semiconductor manufacturers. The semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of Applied’s semiconductor manufacturing equipment and service products, including:•the increasing frequency and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, and Applied’s ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes;•the increasing cost of research and development due to many factors, including shrinking geometries, the use of new materials, new and more complex device structures, more applications and process steps, increasing chip design costs, and the increasing cost and complexity of integrated manufacturing processes;•the need to reduce product development time, despite the increasing difficulty of technical challenges;•the growing number of types and varieties of semiconductors and number of applications across multiple substrate sizes;•the increasing cost and complexity for semiconductor manufacturers to move more technically advanced capability and smaller geometries to volume manufacturing, and the resulting impact on the rates of technology transition and investment in capital equipment;•challenges in generating organic growth given semiconductor manufacturers’ levels of capital expenditures and the allocation of capital investment to market segments that Applied does not serve, such as lithography, or segments where Applied’s products have lower relative market presence;20Table of Contents•the importance of increasing market positions in segments with growing demand;•semiconductor manufacturer’s ability to reconfigure and re-use equipment, and the resulting effect on their need to purchase new equipment and services;•shorter cycle times between order placements by customers and product shipment require greater reliance on forecasting of customer investment, which may lead to inventory write-offs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease gross margin;•competitive factors that make it difficult to enhance position, including challenges in securing development-tool-of-record (DTOR) and production-tool-of-record (PTOR) positions with customers;•consolidation in the semiconductor industry, including among semiconductor manufacturers and among manufacturing equipment suppliers;•shifts in sourcing strategies by computer and electronics companies, and manufacturing processes for advanced circuit technologies, that impact the equipment requirements of Applied’s foundry customers;•the concentration of new wafer starts in Korea and Taiwan, where Applied’s service penetration and service-revenue-per-wafer-start have been lower than in other regions; •investment in semiconductor manufacturing capabilities in China, which may be affected by changes in economic conditions and governmental policies in China and the United States; •the increasing fragmentation of semiconductor markets, leading certain markets to become too small to support the cost of a new fabrication plant, while others require less technologically advanced products; and•the growing importance of specialty markets (such as Internet of Things, communications, automotive, power and sensors) that use mature process technologies and have a low barrier to entry.If Applied does not accurately forecast and allocate appropriate resources and investment towards addressing, key technology changes and inflections, successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new technologies, and effectively address industry trends, its business and results of operations may be adversely impacted.Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the display industry.The global display industry historically has experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment investment levels, due in part to the limited number of display manufacturers, the concentrated nature of end-use applications, production capacity relative to end-use demand, and panel manufacturer profitability. Industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced TVs, and on demand for advanced smartphones and mobile device displays, which demand is highly sensitive to cost and improvements in technologies and features. The display industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of Applied’s display products and services, including:•the importance of new types of display technologies, such as organic light-emitting diode (OLED), low temperature polysilicon (LTPS) and metal oxide transistor backplanes, flexible displays, and new touch panel films;•the increasing cost of research and development, and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, and Applied’s ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes;•the timing and extent of an expansion of manufacturing facilities in China, which may be affected by changes in local economic conditions and governmental policies in China, Korea, Japan and the United States;•the importance of increasing market positions in products and technologies with growing demand;•the rate of transition to larger substrate sizes for TVs and to new display technologies for TVs and mobile applications, and the resulting effect on capital intensity in the industry and on Applied’s product differentiation, gross margin and return on investment; and•fluctuations in customer spending quarter over quarter and year over year for display manufacturing equipment, concentration of display manufacturer customers and their ability to successfully commercialize new products and technologies, and uncertainty with respect to future display technology end-use applications and growth drivers.If Applied does not successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new and emerging display technologies, or if industry demand for display manufacturing equipment and technologies slows, Applied’s business and its results of operations may be adversely impacted.21Table of ContentsThe industries in which Applied operates are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market changes.Applied operates in a highly competitive environment in which innovation is critical, and its future success depends on many factors, including the development of new technologies and effective commercialization and customer acceptance of its equipment, services and related products, and its ability to increase its position in its current markets, expand into adjacent and new markets, and optimize operational performance. The development, introduction and support of a broadening set of products in a geographically diverse and competitive environment, and that may require greater collaboration with customers and other industry participants, have grown more complex and expensive over time. Furthermore, new or improved products may entail higher costs, longer development cycles, lower profits and may have unforeseen product design or manufacturing defects. To compete successfully, Applied must:•identify and address technology inflections, market changes, competitor innovations, new applications, customer requirements and end-use demand in a timely and effective manner;•develop new products and disruptive technologies, improve and develop new applications for existing products, and adapt products for use by customers in different applications and markets with varying technical requirements;•differentiate its products from those of competitors, meet customers’ performance specifications, appropriately price products, and achieve market acceptance;•maintain operating flexibility to enable responses to changing markets, applications, customers and customer requirements;•enhance its worldwide operations across its businesses to reduce cycle time, enable continuous quality improvement, reduce costs, and enhance design for manufacturability and serviceability;•focus on product development and sales and marketing strategies that address customers’ high value problems and strengthen customer relationships;•effectively allocate resources between its existing products and markets, the development of new products, and expanding into new and adjacent markets;•improve the productivity of capital invested in R&D activities;•accurately forecast demand, work with suppliers and meet production schedules for its products;•improve its manufacturing processes and achieve cost efficiencies across product offerings;•adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different parts of the supply chain;•qualify products for evaluation and volume manufacturing with its customers; and •implement changes in its design engineering methodology to reduce material costs and cycle time, increase commonality of platforms and types of parts used in different systems, and improve product life cycle management.If Applied does not successfully anticipate technology inflections, develop and commercialize new products and technologies, and respond to changes in customer requirements and market trends, its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted.Risks Related to Applied’s Business, Finance and OperationsApplied is exposed to risks associated with business combinations, acquisitions, strategic investments and divestitures.Applied engages in acquisitions of or investments in companies, technologies or products in existing, related or new markets for Applied. Business combinations, acquisitions and investments, such as the proposed acquisition of Kokusai Electric, involve numerous risks to Applied’s business, financial condition and operating results, including but not limited to:•inability to complete proposed transactions timely or at all due to the failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals, litigation or other disputes, and any ensuing obligation to pay a termination fee (which, in the case of the stock purchase agreement related to the proposed acquisition of Kokusai Electric, Applied will be obligated to pay in the amount of $154 million if such agreement is terminated under certain circumstances involving the failure to obtain required regulatory approvals);•diversion of management’s attention and disruption of ongoing businesses;•the failure to realize expected revenues, gross and operating margins, net income and other returns from acquired businesses;•requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures and restrictions on the conduct of Applied’s existing business or the acquired business;22Table of Contents•following completion of acquisitions, ineffective integration of businesses, operations, systems, digital and physical security, technologies, products, employees, compliance programs, changes in laws or regulations, including tax laws, or other factors, may impact the ability to realize anticipated synergies or other benefits;•failure to commercialize technologies from acquired businesses or developed through strategic investments;•dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;•inability to capitalize on characteristics of new markets that may be significantly different from Applied’s existing markets and where competitors may have stronger market positions and customer relationships;•failure to retain and motivate key employees of acquired businesses;•the potential impact of the announcement or consummation of a proposed transaction on relationships with third parties;•potential changes in Applied’s credit rating, which could adversely impact the Company’s access to and cost of capital;•reductions in cash balances or increases in debt obligations to finance activities associated with a transaction, which increase interest expense, and reductions in cash balances, which reduce the availability of cash flow for general corporate or other purposes, including share repurchases and dividends;•exposure to new operational risks, rules, regulations, worker expectations, customs and practices to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where Applied has not historically conducted business;•challenges associated with managing new, more diverse and more widespread operations, projects and people;•inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key technologies;•inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company’s internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, cybersecurity, privacy policies and compliance programs, or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices;•impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the segment;•the risk of litigation or claims associated with a proposed or completed transaction;•unknown, underestimated, undisclosed or undetected commitments or liabilities or non-compliance with laws, regulations or policies; and•the inappropriate scale of acquired entities’ critical resources or facilities for business needs.Applied also makes strategic investments in other companies, including companies formed as joint ventures, which may decline in value or not meet desired objectives. The success of these investments depends on various factors over which Applied may have limited or no control and, particularly with respect to joint ventures, requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic partners. In addition, new legislation, additional regulations or global economic or political conditions may affect or impair our ability to invest in certain countries or require us to obtain regulatory approvals to do so. The risks to Applied’s strategic investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and, as a result, the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges.Applied continually assesses the strategic fit of its businesses and may from time to time seek to divest portions of its business that are not deemed to fit with its strategic plan. Divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties, such as ability to sell such businesses on satisfactory price and terms and in a timely manner (including long and costly sales processes and the possibility of lengthy and potentially unsuccessful attempts by a buyer to receive required regulatory approvals), or at all, disruption to other parts of the businesses and distraction of management, allocation of internal resources that would otherwise be devoted to completing strategic acquisitions, loss of key employees or customers, exposure to unanticipated liabilities (including, among other things, those arising from representations and warranties made to a buyer regarding the businesses) or ongoing obligations to support the businesses following such divestitures, and other adverse financial impacts.23Table of ContentsApplied’s indebtedness and debt covenants could adversely affect its financial condition and business.Applied has $5.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding. Under the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes, it may be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon a change of control of Applied and a contemporaneous downgrade of the notes below investment grade. Applied also has in place a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, and a $2.0 billion term loan facility to finance in part its planned acquisition of Kokusai Electric. While no amounts were outstanding under either credit agreement as of October 25, 2020, Applied may borrow amounts in the future under either or both of these agreements. Applied may also enter into new financing arrangements. Applied’s ability to satisfy its debt obligations is dependent upon the results of its business operations and subject to other risks discussed in this section. Significant changes in Applied’s credit rating, disruptions in the global financial markets or changes in the interest rate environment could have a material adverse consequence on Applied’s access to and cost of capital for future financings, and financial condition. If Applied fails to satisfy its debt obligations, or comply with financial and other debt covenants, it may be in default and any borrowings may become immediately due and payable, and such default may also constitute a default under other of Applied’s obligations. There can be no assurance that Applied would have sufficient financial resources or be able to arrange financing to repay any borrowings at such time. Applied is exposed to risks associated with expanding into new and related markets and industries.As part of its growth strategy, Applied must successfully expand into related or new markets and industries, either with its existing products or with new products developed internally, or those developed in collaboration with third parties, or obtained through acquisitions. Applied’s ability to successfully expand its business into new and related markets and industries may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:•the need to devote additional resources to develop new products for, and operate in, new markets;•the need to develop new sales and technical marketing strategies, cultivate relationships with new customers and meet different customer service requirements;•differing rates of profitability and growth among multiple businesses;•Applied’s ability to anticipate demand, capitalize on opportunities, and avoid or minimize risks;•the complexity of managing multiple businesses with variations in production planning, execution, supply chain management and logistics;•the adoption of new business models, business processes and systems;•the complexity of entering into and effectively managing strategic alliances or partnering opportunities;•new materials, processes and technologies;•the need to attract, motivate and retain employees with skills and expertise in these new areas;•new and more diverse customers and suppliers, including some with limited operating histories, uncertain or limited funding, evolving business models or locations in regions where Applied does not have, or has limited, operations;•new or different competitors with potentially more financial or other resources, industry experience and established customer relationships;•entry into new industries and countries, with differing levels of government involvement, laws and regulations, and business, employment and safety practices;•third parties’ intellectual property rights; and•the need to comply with, or work to establish, industry standards and practices.In addition, Applied from time to time receives funding from United States and other government agencies for certain strategic development programs to increase its research and development resources and address new market opportunities. As a condition to this government funding, Applied is often subject to certain record-keeping, audit, intellectual property rights-sharing and/or other obligations.24Table of ContentsSupply chain disruptions, manufacturing interruptions or delays, or the failure to accurately forecast customer demand, could affect Applied’s ability to meet customer demand, lead to higher costs, or result in excess or obsolete inventory.Applied’s business depends on its timely supply of equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of its customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts, including components and subassemblies, from suppliers, including contract manufacturers. The inability to timely obtain sufficient quantities of parts can have an adverse impact on Applied’s manufacturing operations and ability to meet customer demand for equipment, spares and services. Some key parts are subject to long lead-times or obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the countries where Applied conducts its manufacturing. Variable industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for Applied and for companies throughout its supply chain. These conditions may cause some suppliers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other companies, or file for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations. Applied may also experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations, delays in its ability to deliver or install products or services, increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of:•the failure or inability to accurately forecast demand and obtain sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective basis;•volatility in the availability and cost of materials;•difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals;•shipment delays due to transportation interruptions or capacity constraints;•information technology or infrastructure failures, including those of a third party supplier or service provider; and•natural disasters or other events beyond Applied’s control (such as earthquakes, utility interruptions, tsunamis, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, storms or extreme weather conditions, fires, regional economic downturns, regional or global health epidemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical turmoil, increased trade restrictions between the U.S. and China and other countries, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war) in locations where it or its customers or suppliers have manufacturing, research, engineering or other operations.As more fully discussed in the risk factor “The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and global measures taken in response thereto have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, Applied’s operations and financial results” above, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken in response by governments and businesses worldwide to contain its spread, including quarantines, facility closures, travel and logistics restrictions, border controls, and shelter in place or stay at home and social distancing orders, have adversely impacted and are expected to continue to adversely impact Applied’s supply chain, manufacturing, logistics, workforce and operations, as well as the operations of Applied’s customers, suppliers and partners globally. If a supplier fails to meet Applied’s requirements concerning quality, cost, protection of intellectual property, socially-responsible business practices, or other performance factors, Applied may transfer its business to alternative sources, which could entail manufacturing delays, additional costs or other difficulties, and may also result in a loss of Applied’s ability to protect, enforce and extract the full value of its or its customers’ and other third parties’ intellectual property rights, which could have an adverse impact on its business and competitive position and subject Applied to legal proceedings and claims. If Applied is unable to meet its customers’ demand for a prolonged period due to its inability to obtain certain parts or components, it could affect its ability to manage its operations, and have an adverse impact on Applied’s business, results of operations and customer relationships. In addition, if Applied needs to rapidly increase its business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules, this may exacerbate any interruptions in Applied’s manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on Applied’s working capital. Moreover, if actual demand for Applied’s products is different than expected, Applied may purchase more/fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery of parts. If Applied purchases inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize or rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, or if customers reduce or delay orders, Applied may incur excess or obsolete inventory charges.25Table of ContentsThe ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital to Applied’s success.Applied’s success, competitiveness and ability to execute on its global strategies and maintain a culture of innovation depend in large part on its ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees and leaders with expertise and capabilities, representing diverse backgrounds and experiences. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, management changes, Applied’s organizational structure, increasing global competition for talent, the availability of qualified employees in the local and global markets, cost reduction activities (including workforce reductions and unpaid shutdowns), availability of career development opportunities, the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries, and the attractiveness of Applied’s compensation and benefit programs, including its share-based programs. If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees and leaders, we may be unable to fully capitalize on current and new market opportunities, which could adversely impact Applied’s business and results of operations. The loss or retirement of employees presents particular challenges to the extent they involve the departure of knowledgeable and experienced employees and the resulting need to identify and train existing or new workers to perform necessary functions, which may result in unexpected costs, reduced productivity, and/or difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls.The failure to successfully implement enterprise resource planning and other information systems changes could adversely impact Applied’s business and results of operations.Applied periodically implements new or enhanced enterprise resource planning and related information systems in order to better manage its business operations, align its global organizations and enable future growth. Implementation of new business processes and information systems requires the commitment of significant personnel, training and financial resources, and entails risks to Applied’s business operations. If Applied does not successfully implement enterprise resource planning and related information systems improvements, or if there are delays or difficulties in implementing these systems, Applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies, and may experience interruptions in service and operational difficulties, such as its ability to track orders, timely manufacture and ship products, project inventory requirements, effectively manage its supply chain and allocate human resources, aggregate financial data and report operating results, and otherwise effectively manage its business, all of which could result in quality issues, reputational harm, lost market and revenue opportunities, and otherwise adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Applied may incur impairment charges related to goodwill or long-lived assets.Applied has a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions. Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The review compares the fair value for each of Applied’s reporting units to its associated carrying value, including goodwill. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, declines in the market price of Applied common stock, changes in Applied’s strategies or product portfolio, and restructuring activities. Applied’s valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance. Applied may be required to record future charges to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets is determined to exist.Risks Related to Intellectual Property and CybersecurityApplied is exposed to various risks related to protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights.Applied’s success depends in significant part on the protection of its patents, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights. Infringement of Applied’s rights by a third party, such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts, could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for Applied. Policing any unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult and costly and Applied cannot be certain that the measures it has implemented will prevent misuse. Applied’s ability to enforce its intellectual property rights is subject to litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the protection and enforceability of those rights in some countries. If Applied seeks to enforce its intellectual property rights, it may be subject to claims that those rights are invalid or unenforceable, and others may seek counterclaims against Applied, which could have a negative impact on its business. If Applied is unable to enforce and protect intellectual property rights, or if they are circumvented, invalidated, rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, it could have an adverse impact on its competitive position and business. In addition, changes in intellectual property laws or their interpretation may impact Applied’s ability to protect and assert its intellectual property rights, increase costs and uncertainties in the prosecution of patent applications and enforcement or defense of issued patents, and diminish the value of Applied’s intellectual property.26Table of ContentsThird parties may also assert claims against Applied and its products. Claims that Applied’s products infringe the rights of others, whether or not meritorious, can be expensive and time-consuming to defend and resolve, and may divert the efforts and attention of management and personnel. The inability to obtain rights to use third party intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could have an adverse impact on Applied’s business. In addition, Applied may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets and other confidential business information. Any such incidents and claims could severely harm Applied’s business and reputation, result in significant expenses, harm its competitive position, and prevent Applied from selling certain products, all of which could have a significant adverse impact on Applied’s business and results of operations.Applied is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents.In the conduct of its business, Applied collects, uses, transmits and stores data on information technology systems, including systems owned and maintained by Applied or third party providers. These data include confidential information and intellectual property belonging to Applied or its customers or other business partners, as well as personally-identifiable information of individuals. All information systems are subject to disruption, breach or failure. Applied has experienced, and expects to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents ranging from employee error or misuse to individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to these information systems, to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, none of which have been material to the Company to date. Applied devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and other measures to protect its systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse. However, depending on their nature and scope, cybersecurity incidents could result in business disruption; the misappropriation of intellectual property, and corruption or loss of confidential information and critical data (Applied’s and that of third parties); reputational damage; litigation with third parties; diminution in the value of Applied’s investment in research, development and engineering; data privacy issues; and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs. Compliance with, and changes to, laws and regulations concerning privacy and information security could result in significant expense, and any failure to comply could result in proceedings against Applied by regulatory authorities or other third parties.Risks Related to Legal and ComplianceApplied is exposed to risks associated with operating in jurisdictions with complex and changing tax laws.Applied is subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. Applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in applicable tax laws, interpretations of applicable tax laws, amount and composition of pre-tax income in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, and valuation of deferred tax assets. An increase in Applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on Applied’s results of operations and financial condition.Consistent with the international nature of its business, Applied conducts certain manufacturing, supply chain, and other operations in Asia, bringing these activities closer to customers and reducing operating costs. In certain foreign jurisdictions, conditional reduced income tax rates have been granted to Applied. To obtain the benefit of these tax incentives, Applied must meet requirements relating to various activities. Applied’s ability to realize benefits from these incentives could be materially affected if, among other things, applicable requirements are not met or Applied incurs net losses in these jurisdictions.In addition, Applied is subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and from time to time amends previously filed tax returns. Applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes, which requires estimates and judgments. Although Applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will agree with such estimates. Applied may have to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the estimates, which may be time-consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that Applied will be successful or that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in Applied’s historical income tax provisions and effective tax rates.27Table of ContentsApplied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings.Applied from time to time is, and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement, intellectual property rights, antitrust, environmental regulations, securities, contracts, product performance, product liability, unfair competition, misappropriation of trade secrets, employment, workplace safety, and other matters. Applied also on occasion receives notification from customers who believe that Applied owes them indemnification, product warranty or has other obligations related to claims made against such customers by third parties.Legal proceedings and claims, whether with or without merit, and associated internal investigations, may be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct; divert management’s attention and other Applied resources; inhibit Applied’s ability to sell its products; result in adverse judgments for damages, injunctive relief, penalties and fines; and negatively affect Applied’s business. There can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings, claims or investigations.Applied is subject to risks associated with environmental, health and safety regulations.Applied is subject to environmental, health and safety regulations in connection with its global business operations, including but not limited to: regulations related to the development, manufacture, shipping and use of its products; handling, discharge, recycling and disposal of hazardous materials used in its products or in producing its products; the operation of its facilities; and the use of its real property. The failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and safety regulations could result in: significant remediation or other legal liabilities; the imposition of penalties and fines; restrictions on the development, manufacture, sale, shipping or use of certain of its products; limitations on the operation of its facilities or ability to use its real property; and a decrease in the value of its real property. Applied could be required to alter its manufacturing and operations and incur substantial expense in order to comply with environmental, health and safety regulations. Any failure to comply with these regulations could subject Applied to significant costs and liabilities that could adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Applied is exposed to various risks related to the global regulatory environment.As a public company with global operations, Applied is subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions, including those related to financial and other disclosures, accounting standards, corporate governance, intellectual property, tax, trade, antitrust, employment, immigration and travel regulations, privacy, and anti-corruption. Changing, inconsistent or conflicting laws, rules and regulations, and ambiguities in their interpretation and application create uncertainty and challenges, and compliance with laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive, divert management time and attention from revenue-generating activities, and otherwise adversely impact Applied’s business operations. Violations of law, rules and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions, restrictions on Applied’s business, and damage to its reputation, and could have an adverse impact on its business operations, financial condition and results of operations. "
8,AMAT,APPLIED MATERIALS INC,2019-12-13,":      Risk Factors
The following risk factors could materially and adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition or results of operations and cause reputational harm, and should be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its business, in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report.The industries that Applied serves can be volatile and difficult to predict.As a supplier to the global semiconductor and display and related industries, Applied is subject to variable industry conditions, since demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on several factors, including the nature and timing of technology inflections and advances in fabrication processes, the timing and requirements of new and emerging technologies and market drivers, production capacity relative to demand for chips and display technologies, end-user demand, customers’ capacity utilization, production volumes, access to affordable capital, consumer buying patterns and general economic conditions. Applied’s industries historically have been cyclical, and are subject to volatility and sudden changes in customer requirements for new manufacturing capacity and advanced technology. These changes can affect the timing and amounts of customer investments in technology and manufacturing equipment and can have a significant impact on Applied’s net sales, operating expenses, gross margins and net income. The amount and mix of capital equipment spending between different products and technologies can have a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations.To meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves, Applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity across its businesses, and may incur unexpected or additional costs to align its business operations. During periods of increasing demand for its products, Applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand; effectively manage its supply chain; attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees; and continue to control costs. During periods of decreasing demand, Applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions; effectively manage its supply chain; and motivate and retain key employees. If Applied does not effectively manage these challenges during periods of changing demand, its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted. Even with effective allocation of resources and management of costs, during periods of decreasing demand, Applied’s gross margins and earnings may be adversely impacted.Applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business.Applied has product development, engineering, manufacturing, sales and other operations distributed throughout many countries, and some of its business activities are concentrated in certain geographic areas. Moreover, in fiscal 2019, approximately 87 percent of Applied’s net sales were to customers in regions outside the United States. As a result of the global nature of its operations, Applied’s business performance and results of operations may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:•uncertain global economic and political business conditions and demands;•political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations and policies within countries that favor domestic companies over non-domestic companies, including customer- or government-supported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors;•global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade policies, including the ability to obtain required import and export licenses, trade sanctions, tariffs, and international trade disputes;•customer- or government-supported efforts to influence Applied to conduct more of its operations and sourcing in a particular country, such as Korea and China;•variations among, and changes in, local, regional, national or international laws and regulations, including contract, intellectual property, cybersecurity, data privacy, labor, tax, and import/export laws, and the interpretation and application of such laws and regulations;•ineffective or inadequate legal protection of intellectual property rights in certain countries;•positions taken by governmental agencies regarding possible national commercial and/or security issues posed by international business operations;•fluctuating raw material, commodity, energy and shipping costs;•delays or restrictions in shipping materials or finished products between countries;•geographically diverse operations and projects, and our ability to maintain appropriate business processes, procedures and internal controls, and comply with environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption and other regulatory requirements;14Table of Contents•supply chain interruptions, and service interruptions from utilities, transportation, data hosting or telecommunications providers, or other events beyond our control;•failure to effectively manage a diverse workforce with different experience levels, languages, cultures, customs, business practices and worker expectations, and differing employment practices and labor issues;•variations in the ability to develop relationships with local customers, suppliers and governments;•fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates, including the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, Israeli shekel, euro, Taiwanese dollar, Singapore dollar, Chinese yuan or Korean won;•the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations around the world;•performance of third party providers of outsourced functions, including certain engineering, software development, manufacturing, information technology and other activities;•political instability, natural disasters, pandemics, social unrest, terrorism or acts of war in locations where Applied has operations, suppliers or sales, or that may influence the value chain of the industries that Applied serves;•challenges in hiring and integration of an increasing number of workers in new countries;•the increasing need for a mobile workforce to work in or travel to different regions; and•uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various countries, including for the manufacture and sale of semiconductors and displays in the developing economies of certain countries.International trade disputes could result in increases in tariffs and other trade restrictions and protectionist measures that could have an adverse impact on our operations.We sell a significant majority of our products into countries outside of the United States including China, Taiwan and Korea. We also purchase a significant portion of equipment and supplies from suppliers outside of the United States. The United States and other countries have imposed and may continue to impose trade restrictions, and have also levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods. Increases in tariffs, additional taxes or other trade restrictions and retaliatory measures may increasingly impact end-user demand and customer investment in manufacturing equipment, increase our manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses, and our inability to obtain such licenses could potentially limit our markets and impact our business. In addition, government authorities may impose conditions that require the use of local suppliers or partnerships with local companies, require the license or other transfer of intellectual property, or engage in other efforts to promote local businesses and local competitors, which could have a significant adverse impact on Applied’s business. Many of these challenges are present in China and Korea, markets that represent a significant portion of Applied’s current business as well as long-term growth opportunities.Applied is exposed to risks associated with an uncertain global economy.Uncertain global economic and business conditions, along with uncertainties and volatility in the financial markets, national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions, pose challenges to the industries in which Applied operates. Markets for semiconductors and displays depend largely on business and consumer spending and demand for electronic products. Economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain Applied customers to push out, cancel, or refrain from purchasing for equipment or services, which may have an adverse impact on Applied’s revenues, results of operations and financial condition. Uncertain market conditions, difficulties in obtaining capital, or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, which can also result in lower sales, additional inventory or bad debt expense for Applied. Economic and industry uncertainty may similarly affect suppliers, which could impair their ability to deliver parts and negatively affect Applied’s ability to manage operations and deliver its products. These conditions may also lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect Applied’s ability to compete effectively.15Table of ContentsUncertain economic and industry conditions also make it more challenging for Applied to forecast its operating results, make business decisions, and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations. If Applied does not appropriately manage its business operations in response to changing economic and industry conditions, it could have a significant negative impact on its business performance and financial condition. Applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, which may adversely affect Applied’s ability to capitalize on opportunities. Even during periods of economic uncertainty or lower revenues, Applied must continue to invest in research and development and maintain a global business infrastructure to compete effectively and support its customers, which can have a negative impact on its operating margins and earnings.Applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. The risks to Applied’s investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate and, as a result, the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio, as well as returns on pension assets, could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges. Applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations. If any of these financial institutions becomes insolvent, it could limit Applied’s ability to access cash in the affected accounts, which could affect its ability to manage its operations.Applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base.Applied’s customer base is highly concentrated, and has become increasingly so as a result of continued consolidation. Applied’s customer base is also geographically concentrated. A relatively limited number of manufacturers account for a substantial portion of Applied’s business. As a result, the actions of even a single customer can expose Applied’s business and results of operations to greater volatility. The mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, including as a result of changes in government policy, have varied and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year, and have a significant impact on Applied’s net sales, gross margins and net income. Applied’s products are configured to customer specifications, and changing, rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant, non-recoverable costs. If customers do not place orders, or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel orders, Applied may not be able to replace the business, which may have a significant adverse impact on its results of operations and financial condition. The concentration of Applied’s customer base increases its risks related to the financial condition of its customers, and the deterioration in financial condition of a single customer or the failure of a single customer to perform its obligations could have a material adverse effect on Applied’s results of operations and cash flow. To the extent its customers experience liquidity constraints, Applied may incur additional bad debt expense, which may have a significant impact on its results of operations. Major customers may also seek pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to Applied, which may have a negative impact on Applied’s business, cash flow, revenue and gross margins. Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industries in which it operates.The global semiconductor, display and related industries in which Applied operates are characterized by ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries that impact demand for and the profitability of Applied’s products and its consolidated results of operations, including:•the nature, timing and degree of visibility of changes in end demand for electronic products, including those related to fluctuations in consumer buying patterns tied to seasonality or the introduction of new products, and the effects of these changes on customers’ businesses and on demand for Applied’s products;•increasing capital requirements for building and operating new fabrication plants and customers’ ability to raise the necessary capital;•trade, regulatory or tax policies impacting the timing of customers’ investment in new or expanded fabrication plants;•differences in growth rates among the semiconductor, display and other industries in which Applied operates;•the increasing importance of establishing, improving and maintaining strong relationships with customers;•the increasing cost and complexity for customers to move from product design to volume manufacturing, which may slow the adoption rate of new manufacturing technology;•the need for customers to continually reduce the total cost of manufacturing system ownership;•the heightened importance to customers of system reliability and productivity and the effect on demand for fabrication systems as a result of their increasing productivity, device yield and reliability;•manufacturers’ ability to reconfigure and re-use fabrication systems which can reduce demand for new equipment;16Table of Contents•the increasing importance of, and difficulties in, developing products with sufficient differentiation to influence customers’ purchasing decisions;•requirements for shorter cycle times for the development, manufacture and installation of manufacturing equipment;•price and performance trends for semiconductor devices and displays, and the corresponding effect on demand for such products;•the increasing importance of the availability of spare parts to maximize the time that customers’ systems are available for production;•the increasing role for and complexity of software in Applied products; and•the increasing focus on reducing energy usage and improving the environmental impact and sustainability associated with manufacturing operations.Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the semiconductor industry.The largest proportion of Applied’s consolidated net sales and profitability is derived from sales of manufacturing equipment in the Semiconductor Systems segment to the global semiconductor industry. In addition, a majority of the revenues of Applied Global Services is from sales to semiconductor manufacturers. The semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of Applied’s semiconductor manufacturing equipment and service products, including:•the increasing frequency and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, and Applied’s ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes;•the increasing cost of research and development due to many factors, including shrinking geometries, the use of new materials, new and more complex device structures, more applications and process steps, increasing chip design costs, and the increasing cost and complexity of integrated manufacturing processes;•the need to reduce product development time, despite the increasing difficulty of technical challenges;•the growing number of types and varieties of semiconductors and number of applications across multiple substrate sizes;•the increasing cost and complexity for semiconductor manufacturers to move more technically advanced capability and smaller geometries to volume manufacturing, and the resulting impact on the rates of technology transition and investment in capital equipment;•challenges in generating organic growth given semiconductor manufacturers’ levels of capital expenditures and the allocation of capital investment to market segments that Applied does not serve, such as lithography, or segments where Applied’s products have lower relative market presence;•the importance of increasing market positions in segments with growing demand;•semiconductor manufacturer’s ability to reconfigure and re-use equipment, and the resulting effect on their need to purchase new equipment and services;•shorter cycle times between order placements by customers and product shipment require greater reliance on forecasting of customer investment, which may lead to inventory write-offs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease gross margin;•competitive factors that make it difficult to enhance position, including challenges in securing development-tool-of-record (DTOR) and production-tool-of-record (PTOR) positions with customers;•consolidation in the semiconductor industry, including among semiconductor manufacturers and among manufacturing equipment suppliers;•shifts in sourcing strategies by computer and electronics companies, and manufacturing processes for advanced circuit technologies, that impact the equipment requirements of Applied’s foundry customers;•the concentration of new wafer starts in Korea and Taiwan, where Applied’s service penetration and service-revenue-per-wafer-start have been lower than in other regions; •investment in semiconductor manufacturing capabilities in China, which may be affected by changes in economic conditions and governmental policies in China and the United States; •the increasing fragmentation of semiconductor markets, leading certain markets to become too small to support the cost of a new fabrication plant, while others require less technologically advanced products; and17Table of Contents•the growing importance of specialty markets (such as Internet of Things, communications, automotive, power and sensors) that use mature process technologies and have a low barrier to entry.If Applied does not accurately forecast, and allocate appropriate resources and investment towards addressing, key technology changes and inflections, successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new technologies, and effectively address industry trends, its business and results of operations may be adversely impacted.Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the display industry.The global display industry historically has experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment investment levels, due in part to the limited number of display manufacturers, the concentrated nature of end-use applications, production capacity relative to end-use demand, and panel manufacturer profitability. Industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced TVs, and on demand for advanced smartphones and mobile device displays, which demand is highly sensitive to cost and improvements in technologies and features. The display industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of Applied’s display products and services, including:•the importance of new types of display technologies, such as organic light-emitting diode (OLED), low temperature polysilicon (LTPS) and metal oxide transistor backplanes, flexible displays, and new touch panel films;•the increasing cost of research and development, and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, and Applied’s ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes;•the timing and extent of an expansion of manufacturing facilities in China, which may be affected by changes in local economic conditions and governmental policies in China, particularly in Asia and the United States;•the importance of increasing market positions in products and technologies with growing demand;•the rate of transition to larger substrate sizes for TVs and to new display technologies for TVs and mobile applications, and the resulting effect on capital intensity in the industry and on Applied’s product differentiation, gross margin and return on investment; and•fluctuations in customer spending quarter over quarter and year over year  for display manufacturing equipment, concentration of display manufacturer customers and their ability to successfully commercialize new products and technologies, and uncertainty with respect to future display technology end-use applications and growth drivers.If Applied does not successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new and emerging display technologies, or if industry demand for display manufacturing equipment and technologies slows, Applied’s business and its results of operations may be adversely impacted.The industries in which Applied operates are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market changes.Applied operates in a highly competitive environment in which innovation is critical, and its future success depends on many factors, including the development of new technologies and effective commercialization and customer acceptance of its equipment, services and related products, and its ability to increase its position in its current markets, expand into adjacent and new markets, and optimize operational performance. The development, introduction and support of a broadening set of products in a geographically diverse and competitive environment, and that may require greater collaboration with customers and other industry participants, have grown more complex and expensive over time. Furthermore, new or improved products may entail higher costs and lower profits, and may have unforeseen product design or manufacturing defects. To compete successfully, Applied must:•identify and address technology inflections, market changes, competitor innovations, new applications, customer requirements and end-use demand in a timely and effective manner;•develop new products and disruptive technologies, improve and develop new applications for existing products, and adapt products for use by customers in different applications and markets with varying technical requirements;•differentiate its products from those of competitors, meet customers’ performance specifications, appropriately price products, and achieve market acceptance;•maintain operating flexibility to enable responses to changing markets, applications, customers and customer requirements;•enhance its worldwide operations across its businesses to reduce cycle time, enable continuous quality improvement, reduce costs, and enhance design for manufacturability and serviceability;18Table of Contents•focus on product development and sales and marketing strategies that address customers’ high value problems and strengthen customer relationships;•effectively allocate resources between its existing products and markets, the development of new products, and expanding into new and adjacent markets;•improve the productivity of capital invested in R&D activities;•accurately forecast demand, work with suppliers and meet production schedules for its products;•improve its manufacturing processes and achieve cost efficiencies across product offerings;•adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different parts of the supply chain;•qualify products for evaluation and volume manufacturing with its customers; and •implement changes in its design engineering methodology to reduce material costs and cycle time, increase commonality of platforms and types of parts used in different systems, and improve product life cycle management.If Applied does not successfully anticipate technology inflections, develop and commercialize new products and technologies, and respond to changes in customer requirements and market trends, its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted.Applied is exposed to risks associated with business combinations, acquisitions, strategic investments and divestitures.Applied engages in acquisitions of or investments in companies, technologies or products in existing, related or new markets for Applied. Business combinations, acquisitions and investments , such as the proposed acquisition of Kokusai Electric, involve numerous risks to Applied’s business, financial condition and operating results, including but not limited to:•inability to complete proposed transactions timely or at all due to the failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals, litigation or other disputes, and any ensuing obligation to pay a termination fee (which, in the case of the stock purchase agreement related to the proposed acquisition of Kokusai Electric, Applied will be obligated to pay in the amount of $154 million if such agreement is terminated under certain circumstances involving the failure to obtain required regulatory approvals);•diversion of management’s attention and disruption of ongoing businesses;•the failure to realize expected revenues, gross and operating margins, net income and other returns from acquired businesses;•requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures and restrictions on the conduct of Applied’s existing business or the acquired business;•following completion of acquisitions, ineffective integration of businesses, operations, systems, technologies, products or employees, changes in laws or regulations, including tax laws, or other factors, may  impact the ability to realize anticipated synergies or other benefits;•failure to commercialize technologies from acquired businesses or developed through strategic investments;•dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;•inability to capitalize on characteristics of new markets that may be significantly different from Applied’s existing markets and where competitors may have stronger market positions and customer relationships;•failure to retain and motivate key employees of acquired businesses;•the potential impact of the announcement or consummation of a proposed transaction on relationships with third parties;•potential changes in Applied’s credit rating, which could adversely impact the Company’s access to and cost of capital;•reductions in cash balances or increases in debt obligations to finance activities associated with a transaction, which increase interest expense, and reductions in cash balances, which reduce the availability of cash flow for general corporate or other purposes, including share repurchases and dividends;19Table of Contents•exposure to new operational risks, rules, regulations, worker expectations, customs and practices to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where Applied has not historically conducted business;•challenges associated with managing new, more diverse and more widespread operations, projects and people;•inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key technologies;•inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company’s internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, cybersecurity, privacy policies and procedures, or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices;•impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the segment;•the risk of litigation or claims associated with a proposed or completed transaction;•unknown, underestimated or undisclosed commitments or liabilities; and•the inappropriate scale of acquired entities’ critical resources or facilities for business needs.Applied also makes strategic investments in other companies, including companies formed as joint ventures, which may decline in value or not meet desired objectives. The success of these investments depends on various factors over which Applied may have limited or no control and, particularly with respect to joint ventures, requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic partners. In addition, new legislation, additional regulations or global economic or political conditions may affect or impair our ability to invest in certain countries or require us to obtain regulatory approvals to do so. The risks to Applied’s strategic investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and, as a result, the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges.Applied continually assesses the strategic fit of its businesses and may from time to time seek to divest portions of its business that are not deemed to fit with its strategic plan. Divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties, such as ability to sell such businesses on satisfactory price and terms and in a timely manner (including long and costly sales processes and the possibility of lengthy and potentially unsuccessful attempts by a buyer to receive required regulatory approvals), or at all, disruption to other parts of the businesses and distraction of management, allocation of internal resources that would otherwise be devoted to completing strategic acquisitions, loss of key employees or customers, exposure to unanticipated liabilities (including, among other things, those arising from representations and warranties made to a buyer regarding the businesses) or ongoing obligations to support the businesses following such divestitures, and other adverse financial impacts.Applied is exposed to risks associated with operating in jurisdictions with complex and changing tax laws.Applied is subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. Applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in applicable tax laws, interpretations of applicable tax laws, amount and composition of pre-tax income in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, and valuation of deferred tax assets. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). On June 14, 2019, the U.S. government released regulations that significantly affect how the GILTI provision of the Tax Act is interpreted. As a result, Applied reversed a tax benefit of $96 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 that had been realized in the first half of fiscal 2019. An increase in Applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on Applied’s results of operations and financial condition.Consistent with the international nature of its business, Applied conducts certain manufacturing, supply chain, and other operations in Asia, bringing these activities closer to customers and reducing operating costs. In certain foreign jurisdictions, conditional reduced income tax rates have been granted to Applied. To obtain the benefit of these tax incentives, Applied must meet requirements relating to various activities. Applied’s ability to realize benefits from these incentives could be materially affected if, among other things, applicable requirements are not met or Applied incurs net losses in these jurisdictions.In addition, Applied is subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and from time to time amends previously filed tax returns. Applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes, which requires estimates and judgments. Although Applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will agree with such estimates. Applied may have to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the estimates, which may be time-consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that Applied will be successful or that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in Applied’s historical income tax provisions and effective tax rates.20Table of ContentsApplied’s indebtedness and debt covenants could adversely affect its financial condition and business.Applied has $5.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding. Under the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes, it may be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon a change of control of Applied and a contemporaneous downgrade of the notes below investment grade. Applied also has in place a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, and a $2.0 billion term loan facility to finance in part its planned acquisition of Kokusai Electric. While no amounts were outstanding under either credit agreement as of October 27, 2019, Applied may borrow amounts in the future under either or both of these agreements. Applied may also enter into new financing arrangements. Applied’s ability to satisfy its debt obligations is dependent upon the results of its business operations and subject to other risks discussed in this section. Significant changes in Applied’s credit rating or changes in the interest rate environment could have a material adverse consequence on Applied’s access to and cost of capital for future financings, and financial condition. If Applied fails to satisfy its debt obligations, or comply with financial and other debt covenants, it may be in default and any borrowings may become immediately due and payable, and such default may also constitute a default under other of Applied’s obligations. There can be no assurance that Applied would have sufficient financial resources or be able to arrange financing to repay any borrowings at such time. Applied is exposed to risks associated with expanding into new and related markets and industries.As part of its growth strategy, Applied must successfully expand into related or new markets and industries, either with its existing products or with new products developed internally, or those developed in collaboration with third parties, or obtained through acquisitions. Applied’s ability to successfully expand its business into new and related markets and industries may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:•the need to devote additional resources to develop new products for, and operate in, new markets;•the need to develop new sales and technical marketing strategies, cultivate relationships with new customers and meet different customer service requirements;•differing rates of profitability and growth among multiple businesses;•Applied’s ability to anticipate demand, capitalize on opportunities, and avoid or minimize risks;•the complexity of managing multiple businesses with variations in production planning, execution, supply chain management and logistics;•the adoption of new business models, business processes and systems;•the complexity of entering into and effectively managing strategic alliances or partnering opportunities;•new materials, processes and technologies;•the need to attract, motivate and retain employees with skills and expertise in these new areas;•new and more diverse customers and suppliers, including some with limited operating histories, uncertain or limited funding, evolving business models or locations in regions where Applied does not have, or has limited, operations;•new or different competitors with potentially more financial or other resources, industry experience and established customer relationships;•entry into new industries and countries, with differing levels of government involvement, laws and regulations, and business, employment and safety practices;•third parties’ intellectual property rights; and•the need to comply with, or work to establish, industry standards and practices.In addition, Applied from time to time receives funding from United States and other government agencies for certain strategic development programs to increase its research and development resources and address new market opportunities. As a condition to this government funding, Applied is often subject to certain record-keeping, audit, intellectual property rights-sharing and/or other obligations.21Table of ContentsSupply chain disruptions, manufacturing interruptions or delays, or the failure to accurately forecast customer demand, could affect Applied’s ability to meet customer demand lead to higher costs, or result in excess or obsolete inventory.Applied’s business depends on its timely supply of equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of its customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts, including components and subassemblies, from suppliers, including contract manufacturers. The inability to timely obtain sufficient quantities of parts can have an adverse impact on Applied’s manufacturing operations and ability to meet customer demand for equipment, spares and services. Some key parts are subject to long lead-times or obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the countries where Applied conducts its manufacturing. Variable industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for Applied and for companies throughout its supply chain. These conditions may cause some suppliers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other companies, or file for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations. Applied may also experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations, delays in its ability to deliver products or services, increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of:•the failure or inability to accurately forecast demand and obtain sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective basis;•volatility in the availability and cost of materials;•difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals;•shipment delays due to transportation interruptions or capacity constraints;•information technology or infrastructure failures, including those of a third party supplier or service provider; and•natural disasters or other events beyond Applied’s control (such as earthquakes, utility interruptions, tsunamis, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, storms or extreme weather conditions, fires, regional economic downturns, pandemics, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war) in locations where it or its customers or suppliers have manufacturing, research, engineering or other operations.If a supplier fails to meet Applied’s requirements concerning quality, cost, protection of intellectual property, socially-responsible business practices, or other performance factors, Applied may transfer its business to alternative sources, which could entail manufacturing delays, additional costs, or other difficulties. If Applied is unable to meet its customers’ demand for a prolonged period due to its inability to obtain certain parts or components, it could affect its ability to manage its operations, and have an adverse impact on Applied’s business, results of operations and customer relationships. In addition, if Applied needs to rapidly increase its business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules, this may exacerbate any interruptions in Applied’s manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on Applied’s working capital. Moreover, if actual demand for Applied’s products is different than expected, Applied may purchase more/fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery of parts. If Applied purchases inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize, or if customers reduce or delay orders, Applied may incur excess inventory charges.The ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital to Applied’s success.Applied’s success, competitiveness and ability to execute on its global strategies and maintain a culture of innovation depend in large part on its ability to attract, retain and motivate employees with key skills and experience. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, management changes, Applied’s organizational structure, increasing global competition for talent, the availability of qualified employees in the local and global markets, cost reduction activities (including workforce reductions and unpaid shutdowns), availability of career development opportunities, the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries, and the attractiveness of Applied’s compensation and benefit programs, including its share-based programs. The loss or retirement of employees presents particular challenges to the extent they involve the departure of knowledgeable and experienced employees and the resulting need to identify and train existing or new workers to perform necessary functions, which may result in unexpected costs, reduced productivity, and/or difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls.22Table of ContentsApplied is exposed to various risks related to protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights.Applied’s success depends in significant part on the protection of its patents, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights. Infringement of Applied’s rights by a third party, such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts, could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for Applied. Policing any unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult and costly and Applied cannot be certain that the measures it has implemented will prevent misuse. Applied’s ability to enforce its intellectual property rights is subject to litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the protection and enforceability of those rights in some countries. If Applied seeks to enforce its intellectual property rights, it may be subject to claims that those rights are invalid or unenforceable, and others may seek counterclaims against Applied, which could have a negative impact on its business. If Applied is unable to enforce and protect intellectual property rights, or if they are circumvented, invalidated, rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, it could have an adverse impact on its competitive position and business. In addition, changes in intellectual property laws or their interpretation may impact Applied’s ability to protect and assert its intellectual property rights, increase costs and uncertainties in the prosecution of patent applications and enforcement or defense of issued patents, and diminish the value of Applied’s intellectual property.Third parties may also assert claims against Applied and its products. Claims that Applied’s products infringe the rights of others, whether or not meritorious, can be expensive and time-consuming to defend and resolve, and may divert the efforts and attention of management and personnel. The inability to obtain rights to use third party intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could have an adverse impact on Applied’s business. In addition, Applied may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets and other confidential business information. Any such incidents and claims could severely harm Applied’s business and reputation, result in significant expenses, harm its competitive position, and prevent Applied from selling certain products, all of which could have a significant adverse impact on Applied’s business and results of operations.   Applied is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents.In the conduct of its business, Applied collects, uses, transmits and stores data on information technology systems, including systems owned and maintained by Applied or third party providers. These data include confidential information and intellectual property belonging to Applied or its customers or other business partners, as well as personally-identifiable information of individuals. All information systems are subject to disruption, breach or failure. Applied has experienced, and expects to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents ranging from employee error or misuse to individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to these information systems, to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, none of which have been material to the Company to date. Applied devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and other measures to protect its systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse. However, depending on their nature and scope, cybersecurity incidents could result in business disruption; the misappropriation of intellectual property, and corruption or loss of confidential information and critical data (Applied’s and that of third parties); reputational damage; litigation with third parties; diminution in the value of Applied’s investment in research, development and engineering; data privacy issues; and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs. Compliance with, and changes to, laws and regulations concerning privacy and information security could result in significant expense, and any failure to comply could result in proceedings against Applied by regulatory authorities or other third parties.Applied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings.Applied from time to time is, and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement, intellectual property rights, antitrust, environmental regulations, securities, contracts, product performance, product liability, unfair competition, misappropriation of trade secrets, employment, workplace safety, and other matters. Applied also on occasion receives notification from customers who believe that Applied owes them indemnification, product warranty or has other obligations related to claims made against such customers by third parties.Legal proceedings and claims, whether with or without merit, and associated internal investigations, may be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct; divert management’s attention and other Applied resources; inhibit Applied’s ability to sell its products; result in adverse judgments for damages, injunctive relief, penalties and fines; and negatively affect Applied’s business. There can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings, claims or investigations.23Table of ContentsThe failure to successfully implement enterprise resource planning and other information systems changes could adversely impact Applied’s business and results of operations.Applied periodically implements new or enhanced enterprise resource planning and related information systems in order to better manage its business operations, align its global organizations and enable future growth. Implementation of new business processes and information systems requires the commitment of significant personnel, training and financial resources, and entails risks to Applied’s business operations. If Applied does not successfully implement enterprise resource planning and related information systems improvements, or if there are delays or difficulties in implementing these systems, Applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies, and may experience interruptions in service and operational difficulties, such as its ability to track orders, timely manufacture and ship products, project inventory requirements, effectively manage its supply chain and allocate human resources, aggregate financial data and report operating results, and otherwise effectively manage its business, all of which could result in quality issues, reputational harm, lost market and revenue opportunities, and otherwise adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Applied may incur impairment charges related to goodwill or long-lived assets.Applied has a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions. Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The review compares the fair value for each of Applied’s reporting units to its associated carrying value, including goodwill. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, declines in the market price of Applied common stock, changes in Applied’s strategies or product portfolio, and restructuring activities. Applied’s valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance. Applied may be required to record future charges to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets is determined to exist.Applied is subject to risks associated with environmental, health and safety regulations.Applied is subject to environmental, health and safety regulations in connection with its global business operations, including but not limited to: regulations related to the development, manufacture, shipping and use of its products; handling, discharge, recycling and disposal of hazardous materials used in its products or in producing its products; the operation of its facilities; and the use of its real property. The failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and safety regulations could result in: significant remediation or other legal liabilities; the imposition of penalties and fines; restrictions on the development, manufacture, sale, shipment or use of certain of its products; limitations on the operation of its facilities or ability to use its real property; and a decrease in the value of its real property. Applied could be required to alter its manufacturing and operations and incur substantial expense in order to comply with environmental, health and safety regulations. Any failure to comply with these regulations could subject Applied to significant costs and liabilities that could adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Applied is exposed to various risks related to the global regulatory environment.As a public company with global operations, Applied is subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions, including those related to financial and other disclosures, accounting standards, corporate governance, intellectual property, tax, trade, antitrust, employment, immigration and travel regulations, privacy, and anti-corruption. Changing, inconsistent or conflicting laws, rules and regulations, and ambiguities in their interpretation and application create uncertainty and challenges, and compliance with laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive, divert management time and attention from revenue-generating activities, and otherwise adversely impact Applied’s business operations. Violations of law, rules and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions, restrictions on Applied’s business, and damage to its reputation, and could have an adverse impact on its business operations, financial condition and results of operations.24Table of Contents"
13,AMAT,APPLIED MATERIALS INC,2018-12-13,":Risk Factors
The following risk factors could materially and adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition or results of operations and cause reputational harm, and should be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its business, in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report.The industries that Applied serves can be volatile and difficult to predict.As a supplier to the global semiconductor and display and related industries, Applied is subject to variable industry conditions, as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on several factors, including the nature and timing of technology inflections and advances in fabrication processes, the timing and requirements of new and emerging technologies and market drivers, production capacity relative to demand for chips and display technologies, end-user demand, customers’ capacity utilization, production volumes, access to affordable capital, consumer buying patterns and general economic conditions. Applied’s industries historically have been cyclical, and are subject to volatility and sudden changes in customer requirements for new manufacturing capacity and advanced technology. These changes can affect the timing and amounts of customer investments in technology and manufacturing equipment, and can have a significant impact on Applied’s net sales, operating expenses, gross margins and net income. The amount and mix of capital equipment spending between different products and technologies can have a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations.To meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves, Applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity across its businesses, and may incur unexpected or additional costs to align its business operations. During periods of increasing demand for its products, Applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand; effectively manage its supply chain; attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees; and continue to control costs. During periods of decreasing demand, Applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions; effectively manage its supply chain; and motivate and retain key employees. If Applied does not effectively manage these challenges during periods of changing demand, its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted. Even with effective allocation of resources and management of costs, during periods of decreasing demand, Applied’s gross margins and earnings may be adversely impacted.Applied is exposed to risks associated with an uncertain global economy.Uncertain global economic and business conditions, along with uncertainties and volatility in the financial markets, national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions, pose challenges to the industries in which Applied operates. Markets for semiconductors and displays depend largely on business and consumer spending and demand for electronic products. Economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain Applied customers to push out, cancel, or refrain from purchasing for equipment or services, which may have an adverse impact on Applied’s revenues, results of operations and financial condition. Uncertain market conditions, difficulties in obtaining capital, or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, which can also result in lower sales, additional inventory or bad debt expense for Applied. Economic and industry uncertainty may similarly affect suppliers, which could impair their ability to deliver parts and negatively affect Applied’s ability to manage operations and deliver its products. These conditions may also lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect Applied’s ability to compete effectively.Uncertain economic and industry conditions also make it more challenging for Applied to forecast its operating results, make business decisions, and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations. If Applied does not appropriately manage its business operations in response to changing economic and industry conditions, it could have a significant negative impact on its business performance and financial condition. Applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, which may adversely affect Applied’s ability to capitalize on opportunities. Even during periods of economic uncertainty or lower revenues, Applied must continue to invest in research and development and maintain a global business infrastructure to compete effectively and support its customers, which can have a negative impact on its operating margins and earnings.Applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. The risks to Applied’s investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate and, as a result, the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio, as well as returns on pension assets, could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges. Applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations. If any of these financial institutions becomes insolvent, it could limit Applied’s ability to access cash in the affected accounts, which could affect its ability to manage its operations.14Table of ContentsApplied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business.Applied has product development, engineering, manufacturing, sales and other operations distributed throughout many countries, and some of its business activities are concentrated in certain geographic areas. Moreover, in fiscal 2018, approximately 91 percent of Applied’s net sales were to customers in regions outside the United States. As a result of the global nature of its operations, Applied’s business performance and results of operations may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:•uncertain global economic and political business conditions and demands;•political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations and policies within countries that favor domestic companies over non-domestic companies, including customer- or government-supported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors;•global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade policies, including the ability to obtain required import and export licenses, trade sanctions, tariffs, and international trade disputes;•customer- or government-supported efforts to influence Applied to conduct more of its operations and sourcing in a particular country, such as Korea and China;•variations among, and changes in, local, regional, national or international laws and regulations, including contract, intellectual property, cybersecurity, data privacy, labor, tax, and import/export laws, and the interpretation and application of such laws and regulations;•ineffective or inadequate legal protection of intellectual property rights in certain countries;•positions taken by governmental agencies regarding possible national commercial and/or security issues posed by international business operations;•fluctuating raw material, commodity, energy and shipping costs;•delays or restrictions in shipping materials or finished products between countries;•geographically diverse operations and projects, and our ability to maintain appropriate business processes, procedures and internal controls, and comply with environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption and other regulatory requirements;•supply chain interruptions, and service interruptions from utilities, transportation, data hosting or telecommunications providers, or other events beyond our control;•a diverse workforce with different experience levels, languages, cultures, customs, business practices and worker expectations, and differing employment practices and labor issues;•variations in the ability to develop relationships with local customers, suppliers and governments;•fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates, including the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, euro, Taiwanese dollar, Israeli shekel, Chinese yuan or Singapore dollar;•the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations around the world;•performance of third party providers of outsourced functions, including certain engineering, software development, manufacturing, information technology and other activities;•political instability, natural disasters, pandemics, social unrest, terrorism or acts of war in locations where Applied has operations, suppliers or sales, or that may influence the value chain of the industries that Applied serves;•challenges in hiring and integration of an increasing number of workers in new countries;•the increasing need for a mobile workforce to work in or travel to different regions; and•uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various countries, including for the manufacture and sale of semiconductors and displays in the developing economies of certain countries.International trade disputes could result in increases in tariffs and other trade restrictions and protectionist measures that could have an adverse impact on our operations.We sell a significant majority of our products into countries outside of the United States and we purchase a significant portion of equipment and supplies from suppliers outside of the United States. The United States and other countries have levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods. Increases in tariffs, additional taxes or other trade restrictions and retaliatory measures may impact end-user demand and customer investment in manufacturing equipment, increase our manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 15Table of ContentsCertain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses, and our inability to obtain such licenses could potentially limit our markets and impact our business. In addition, government authorities may impose conditions that require the use of local suppliers or partnerships with local companies, require the license or other transfer of intellectual property, or engage in other efforts to promote local businesses and local competitors, which could have a significant adverse impact on Applied’s business. Many of these challenges are present in China and Korea, markets that represent significant long-term growth opportunities for Applied businesses.Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industries in which it operates.The global semiconductor, display and related industries in which Applied operates are characterized by ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries that impact demand for and the profitability of Applied’s products and its consolidated results of operations, including:•the nature, timing and degree of visibility of changes in end demand for electronic products, including those related to fluctuations in consumer buying patterns tied to seasonality or the introduction of new products, and the effects of these changes on customers’ businesses and on demand for Applied’s products;•increasing capital requirements for building and operating new fabrication plants and customers’ ability to raise the necessary capital;•trade, regulatory or tax policies impacting the timing of customers’ investment in new or expanded fabrication plants;•differences in growth rates among the semiconductor, display and other industries in which Applied operates;•the increasing importance of establishing, improving and maintaining strong relationships with customers;•the increasing cost and complexity for customers to move from product design to volume manufacturing, which may slow the adoption rate of new manufacturing technology;•the need for customers to continually reduce the total cost of manufacturing system ownership;•the heightened importance to customers of system reliability and productivity and the effect on demand for fabrication systems as a result of their increasing productivity, device yield and reliability;•manufacturers’ ability to reconfigure and re-use fabrication systems which can reduce demand for new equipment;•the increasing importance of, and difficulties in, developing products with sufficient differentiation to influence customers’ purchasing decisions;•requirements for shorter cycle times for the development, manufacture and installation of manufacturing equipment;•price and performance trends for semiconductor devices and displays, and the corresponding effect on demand for such products;•the increasing importance of the availability of spare parts to maximize the time that customers’ systems are available for production;•the increasing role for and complexity of software in Applied products; and•the increasing focus on reducing energy usage and improving the environmental impact and sustainability associated with manufacturing operations.Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the semiconductor industry.The largest proportion of Applied’s consolidated net sales and profitability is derived from sales of manufacturing equipment in the Semiconductor Systems segment to the global semiconductor industry. In addition, a majority of the revenues of Applied Global Services is from sales to semiconductor manufacturers. The semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of Applied’s semiconductor equipment and service products, including:•the increasing frequency and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, and Applied’s ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes;•the increasing cost of research and development due to many factors, including shrinking geometries, the use of new materials, new and more complex device structures, more applications and process steps, increasing chip design costs, and the increasing cost and complexity of integrated manufacturing processes;•the need to reduce product development time, despite the increasing difficulty of technical challenges;•the growing number of types and varieties of semiconductors and number of applications across multiple substrate sizes;16Table of Contents•the increasing cost and complexity for semiconductor manufacturers to move more technically advanced capability and smaller geometries to volume manufacturing, and the resulting impact on the rates of technology transition and investment in capital equipment;•challenges in generating organic growth given semiconductor manufacturers’ levels of capital expenditures and the allocation of capital investment to market segments that Applied does not serve, such as lithography, or segments where Applied’s products have lower relative market presence;•the importance of increasing market positions in segments with growing demand;•semiconductor manufacturer’s ability to reconfigure and re-use equipment, and the resulting effect on their need to purchase new equipment and services;•shorter cycle times between order placements by customers and product shipment require greater reliance on forecasting of customer investment, which may lead to inventory write-offs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease gross margin;•competitive factors that make it difficult to enhance position, including challenges in securing development-tool-of-record (DTOR) and production-tool-of-record (PTOR) positions with customers;•consolidation in the semiconductor industry, including among semiconductor manufacturers and among manufacturing equipment suppliers;•shifts in sourcing strategies by computer and electronics companies that impact the equipment requirements of Applied’s foundry customers;•the concentration of new wafer starts in Korea and Taiwan, where Applied’s service penetration and service-revenue-per-wafer-start have been lower than in other regions; •investment in semiconductor manufacturing capabilities in China, which may be affected by changes in economic conditions and governmental policies in China; and•the increasing fragmentation of semiconductor markets, leading certain markets to become too small to support the cost of a new fabrication plant, while others require less technologically advanced products.If Applied does not accurately forecast, and allocate appropriate resources and investment towards addressing, key technology changes and inflections, successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new technologies, and effectively address industry trends, its business and results of operations may be adversely impacted.Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the display industry.The global display industry historically has experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment investment levels, due in part to the limited number of display manufacturers, the concentrated nature of end-use applications, production capacity relative to end-use demand, and panel manufacturer profitability. Industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced TVs, and on demand for advanced smartphones and mobile device displays, which demand is highly sensitive to cost and improvements in technologies and features. The display industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of Applied’s display products and services, including:•the importance of new types of display technologies, such as organic light-emitting diode (OLED), low temperature polysilicon (LTPS), flexible displays and metal oxide, and new touch panel films;•the increasing cost of research and development, and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, and Applied’s ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes;•the timing and extent of an expansion of manufacturing facilities in China, which may be affected by changes in economic conditions and governmental policies in China;•the importance of increasing market positions in products and technologies with growing demand;•the rate of transition to larger substrate sizes for TVs and to new display technologies for TVs and mobile applications, and the resulting effect on capital intensity in the industry and on Applied’s product differentiation, gross margin and return on investment; and•the variability in demand for display manufacturing equipment, concentration of display manufacturer customers and their ability to successfully commercialize new products and technologies, and uncertainty with respect to future display technology end-use applications and growth drivers.If Applied does not successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new and emerging display technologies, or if industry demand for display manufacturing equipment and technologies slows, Applied’s business and its results of operations may be adversely impacted.17Table of ContentsThe industries in which Applied operates are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market changes.Applied operates in a highly competitive environment in which innovation is critical, and its future success depends on many factors, including the development of new technologies and effective commercialization and customer acceptance of its equipment, services and related products, and its ability to increase its position in its current markets, expand into adjacent and new markets, and optimize operational performance. The development, introduction and support of a broadening set of products in a geographically diverse and competitive environment, and that may require greater collaboration with customers and other industry participants, have grown more complex and expensive over time. Furthermore, new or improved products may entail higher costs and lower profits. To compete successfully, Applied must:•identify and address technology inflections, market changes, new applications, customer requirements and end-use demand;•develop new products and disruptive technologies, improve and develop new applications for existing products, and adapt products for use by customers in different applications and markets with varying technical requirements;•differentiate its products from those of competitors, meet customers’ performance specifications, appropriately price products, and achieve market acceptance;•maintain operating flexibility to enable responses to changing markets, applications, customers and customer requirements;•enhance its worldwide operations across its businesses to reduce cycle time, enable continuous quality improvement, reduce costs, and enhance design for manufacturability and serviceability;•focus on product development and sales and marketing strategies that address customers’ high value problems and strengthen customer relationships;•effectively allocate resources between its existing products and markets, the development of new products, and expanding into new and adjacent markets;•improve the productivity of capital invested in R&D activities;•accurately forecast demand, work with suppliers and meet production schedules for its products;•improve its manufacturing processes and achieve cost efficiencies across product offerings;•adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different parts of the supply chain;•qualify products for evaluation and volume manufacturing with its customers; and •implement changes in its design engineering methodology to reduce material costs and cycle time, increase commonality of platforms and types of parts used in different systems, and improve product life cycle management.If Applied does not successfully anticipate technology inflections, develop and commercialize new products and technologies, and respond to changes in customer requirements and market trends, its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted.Applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base.Applied’s customer base is highly concentrated, and has become increasingly concentrated as a result of continued consolidation. Applied’s customer base is also geographically concentrated. A relatively limited number of manufacturers account for a substantial portion of Applied’s business. As a result, the actions of even a single customer can expose Applied’s business and results of operations to greater volatility. The mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, including as a result of changes in government policy, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year, and have a significant impact on Applied’s net sales, gross margins and net income. Applied’s products are configured to customer specifications, and changing, rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant, non-recoverable costs. If customers do not place orders, or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel orders, Applied may not be able to replace the business, which may have a significant adverse impact on its results of operations and financial condition. The concentration of Applied’s customer base increases its risks related to the financial condition of its customers, and the deterioration in financial condition of a single customer or the failure of a single customer to perform its obligations could have a material adverse effect on Applied’s results of operations and cash flow. To the extent its customers experience liquidity constraints, Applied may incur additional bad debt expense, which may have a significant impact on its results of operations. Major customers may also seek pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to Applied, which may have a negative impact on Applied’s business, cash flow, revenue and gross margins. 18Table of ContentsApplied is exposed to risks associated with business combinations, acquisitions and strategic investments.Applied engages in acquisitions of or investments in companies, technologies or products in existing, related or new markets for Applied. Business combinations, acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks to Applied’s business, financial condition and operating results, including but not limited to:•diversion of management’s attention and disruption of ongoing businesses;•contractual restrictions on the conduct of Applied’s business during the pendency of a proposed transaction;•inability to complete proposed transactions due to the failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals, litigation or other disputes, and any ensuing obligation to pay a termination fee;•the failure to realize expected returns from acquired businesses;•requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures and restrictions on the conduct of Applied’s existing business or the acquired business;•ineffective integration of operations, systems, technologies, products or employees, which can impact the ability to realize anticipated synergies or other benefits;•failure to commercialize technologies from acquired businesses or developed through strategic investments;•dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;•inability to capitalize on characteristics of new markets that may be significantly different from Applied’s existing markets and where competitors may have stronger market positions and customer relationships;•failure to retain and motivate key employees of acquired businesses;•the potential impact of the announcement or consummation of a proposed transaction on relationships with third parties;•potential changes in Applied’s credit rating, which could adversely impact the Company’s access to and cost of capital;•reductions in cash balances or increases in debt obligations to finance activities associated with a transaction, which reduce the availability of cash flow for general corporate or other purposes, including share repurchases and dividends;•exposure to new operational risks, rules, regulations, worker expectations, customs and practices to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where Applied has not historically conducted business;•challenges associated with managing new, more diverse and more widespread operations, projects and people;•inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key technologies;•inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company’s internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, cybersecurity, privacy policies and procedures, or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices;•impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the segment;•the risk of litigation or claims associated with a proposed or completed transaction;•unknown, underestimated or undisclosed commitments or liabilities; and•the inappropriate scale of acquired entities’ critical resources or facilities for business needs.Applied also makes strategic investments in other companies, including companies formed as joint ventures, which may decline in value or not meet desired objectives. The success of these investments depends on various factors over which Applied may have limited or no control and, particularly with respect to joint ventures, requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic partners. In addition, new legislation or additional regulations may affect or impair our ability to invest in certain countries or require us to obtain regulatory approvals to do so. The risks to Applied’s strategic investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and, as a result, the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges.19Table of ContentsApplied’s indebtedness and debt covenants could adversely affect its financial condition and business.Applied has $5.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding. Under the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes, it may be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon a change of control of Applied and a contemporaneous downgrade of the notes below investment grade. Applied also has in place a $1.5 billion committed revolving credit agreement. While no amounts were outstanding under this credit agreement at October 28, 2018, Applied may borrow amounts in the future under the agreement. Applied may also enter into new financing arrangements. Applied’s ability to satisfy its debt obligations is dependent upon the results of its business operations and subject to other risks discussed in this section. Significant changes in Applied’s credit rating or changes in the interest rate environment could have a material adverse consequence on Applied’s access to and cost of capital for future financings, and financial condition. If Applied fails to satisfy its debt obligations, or comply with financial and other debt covenants, it may be in default and any borrowings may become immediately due and payable, and such default may also constitute a default under other of Applied’s obligations. There can be no assurance that Applied would have sufficient financial resources or be able to arrange financing to repay any borrowings at such time. Applied is exposed to risks associated with expanding into new and related markets and industries.As part of its growth strategy, Applied must successfully expand into related or new markets and industries, either with its existing products or with new products developed internally, or those developed in collaboration with third parties, or obtained through acquisitions. Applied’s ability to successfully expand its business into new and related markets and industries may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:•the need to devote additional resources to develop new products for, and operate in, new markets;•the need to develop new sales and technical marketing strategies, cultivate relationships with new customers and meet different customer service requirements;•differing rates of profitability and growth among multiple businesses;•Applied’s ability to anticipate demand, capitalize on opportunities, and avoid or minimize risks;•the complexity of managing multiple businesses with variations in production planning, execution, supply chain management and logistics;•the adoption of new business models, business processes and systems;•the complexity of entering into and effectively managing strategic alliances or partnering opportunities;•new materials, processes and technologies;•the need to attract, motivate and retain employees with skills and expertise in these new areas;•new and more diverse customers and suppliers, including some with limited operating histories, uncertain or limited funding, evolving business models or locations in regions where Applied does not have, or has limited, operations;•new or different competitors with potentially more financial or other resources, industry experience and established customer relationships;•entry into new industries and countries, with differing levels of government involvement, laws and regulations, and business, employment and safety practices;•third parties’ intellectual property rights; and•the need to comply with, or work to establish, industry standards and practices.In addition, Applied from time to time receives funding from United States and other government agencies for certain strategic development programs to increase its research and development resources and address new market opportunities. As a condition to this government funding, Applied may be subject to certain record-keeping, audit, intellectual property rights-sharing and/or other obligations.20Table of ContentsManufacturing interruptions or delays, or the failure to accurately forecast customer demand, could affect Applied’s ability to meet customer demand, lead to higher costs, or result in excess or obsolete inventory.Applied’s business depends on its timely supply of equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of its customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts, including components and subassemblies, from suppliers, including contract manufacturers. The inability to timely obtain sufficient quantities of parts can have an adverse impact on Applied’s manufacturing operations and ability to meet customer demand for equipment, spares and services. Some key parts are subject to long lead-times or obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the countries where Applied conducts its manufacturing. Variable industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for Applied and for companies throughout its supply chain. These conditions may cause some suppliers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other companies, or file for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations. Applied may also experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations, delays in its ability to deliver products or services, increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of:•the failure or inability to accurately forecast demand and obtain sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective basis;•volatility in the availability and cost of materials;•difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals;•shipment delays due to transportation interruptions or capacity constraints;•information technology or infrastructure failures, including those of a third party supplier or service provider; and•natural disasters or other events beyond Applied’s control (such as earthquakes, floods or storms, regional economic downturns, pandemics, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war), particularly where it conducts manufacturing.If a supplier fails to meet Applied’s requirements concerning quality, cost, protection of intellectual property, socially-responsible business practices, or other performance factors, Applied may transfer its business to alternative sources, which could entail manufacturing delays, additional costs, or other difficulties. If Applied is unable to meet its customers’ demand for a prolonged period due to its inability to obtain certain parts or components, it could affect its ability to manage its operations, and have an adverse impact on Applied’s business, results of operations and customer relationships. In addition, if Applied needs to rapidly increase its business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules, this may exacerbate any interruptions in Applied’s manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on Applied’s working capital. Moreover, if actual demand for Applied’s products is different than expected, Applied may purchase more/fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery of parts. If Applied purchases inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize, or if customers reduce or delay orders, Applied may incur excess inventory charges.The ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital to Applied’s success.Applied’s success, competitiveness and ability to execute on its global strategies and maintain a culture of innovation depend in large part on its ability to attract, retain and motivate employees with key skills and experience. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, management changes, Applied’s organizational structure, increasing global competition for talent, the availability of qualified employees, cost reduction activities (including workforce reductions and unpaid shutdowns), availability of career development opportunities, the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries, and the attractiveness of Applied’s compensation and benefit programs, including its share-based programs. The loss or retirement of employees present particular challenges to the extent they involve the departure of knowledgeable and experienced employees and the resulting need to identify and train existing or new workers to perform necessary functions, which may result in unexpected costs, reduced productivity, and/or difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls.21Table of ContentsApplied is exposed to various risks related to protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights.Applied’s success depends in significant part on the protection of its patents, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights. Infringement of Applied’s rights by a third party, such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts, could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for Applied. Policing any unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult and costly and Applied cannot be certain that the measures it has implemented will prevent misuse. Applied’s ability to enforce its intellectual property rights is subject to litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the protection and enforceability of those rights in some countries. If Applied seeks to enforce its intellectual property rights, it may be subject to claims that those rights are invalid or unenforceable, and others may seek counterclaims against Applied, which could have a negative impact on its business. If Applied is unable to enforce and protect intellectual property rights, or if they are circumvented, invalidated, rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, it could have an adverse impact on its competitive position and business. In addition, changes in intellectual property laws or their interpretation, such as recent changes in U.S. patent laws, may impact Applied’s ability to protect and assert its intellectual property rights, increase costs and uncertainties in the prosecution of patent applications and enforcement or defense of issued patents, and diminish the value of Applied’s intellectual property.Third parties may also assert claims against Applied and its products. Claims that Applied’s products infringe the rights of others, whether or not meritorious, can be expensive and time-consuming to defend and resolve, and may divert the efforts and attention of management and personnel. The inability to obtain rights to use third party intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could have an adverse impact on Applied’s business. In addition, Applied may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets and other confidential business information. Any such incidents and claims could severely harm Applied’s business and reputation, result in significant expenses, harm its competitive position, and prevent Applied from selling certain products, all of which could have a significant adverse impact on Applied’s business and results of operations.   Applied is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents.In the conduct of its business, Applied collects, uses, transmits and stores data on information technology systems, including systems owned and maintained by Applied or third party providers. These data include confidential information and intellectual property belonging to Applied or its customers or other business partners, as well as personally-identifiable information of individuals. All information systems are subject to disruption, breach or failure. Applied has experienced, and expects to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents ranging from employee error or misuse to individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to these information systems, to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, none of which have been material to the Company to date. Applied devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and other measures to protect its systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse. However, depending on their nature and scope, cybersecurity incidents could result in business disruption; the misappropriation of intellectual property, and corruption or loss of confidential information and critical data (Applied’s and that of third parties); reputational damage; litigation with third parties; diminution in the value of Applied’s investment in research, development and engineering; data privacy issues; and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs. Compliance with, and changes to, laws and regulations concerning privacy and information security could result in significant expense, and any failure to comply could result in proceedings against Applied by regulatory authorities or other third parties.Applied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings.Applied from time to time is, and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement, intellectual property rights, antitrust, environmental regulations, securities, contracts, product performance, product liability, unfair competition, misappropriation of trade secrets, employment, workplace safety, and other matters. Applied also on occasion receives notification from customers who believe that Applied owes them indemnification or other obligations related to claims made against such customers by third parties.Legal proceedings and claims, whether with or without merit, and associated internal investigations, may be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct; divert management’s attention and other Applied resources; inhibit Applied’s ability to sell its products; result in adverse judgments for damages, injunctive relief, penalties and fines; and negatively affect Applied’s business. There can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings, claims or investigations.22Table of ContentsThe failure to successfully implement enterprise resource planning and other information systems changes could adversely impact Applied’s business and results of operations.Applied periodically implements new or enhanced enterprise resource planning and related information systems in order to better manage its business operations, align its global organizations and enable future growth. Implementation of new business processes and information systems requires the commitment of significant personnel, training and financial resources, and entails risks to Applied’s business operations. If Applied does not successfully implement enterprise resource planning and related information systems improvements, or if there are delays or difficulties in implementing these systems, Applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies, and may experience interruptions in service and operational difficulties, such as its ability to track orders, timely manufacture and ship products, project inventory requirements, effectively manage its supply chain and allocate human resources, aggregate financial data and report operating results, and otherwise effectively manage its business, all of which could result in quality issues, reputational harm, lost market and revenue opportunities, and otherwise adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Applied may incur impairment charges to goodwill or long-lived assets.Applied has a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions. Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The review compares the fair value for each of Applied’s reporting units to its associated carrying value, including goodwill. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, declines in the market price of Applied common stock, changes in Applied’s strategies or product portfolio, and restructuring activities. Applied’s valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance. Applied may be required to record future charges to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets is determined to exist.Applied is exposed to risks associated with operating in jurisdictions with complex and changing tax laws.Applied is subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. Applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in applicable tax laws, interpretations of applicable tax laws, amount and composition of pre-tax income in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, and valuation of deferred tax assets. An increase in Applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on Applied’s results of operations and financial condition.On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted tax legislation referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The U.S. government may issue regulations that significantly affect how the Tax Act is interpreted. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), which provides guidance on accounting for income tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 provides a measurement period for companies to complete this accounting, which will not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date. Pursuant to SAB 118, provisional adjustments were recorded when reasonable estimates could be determined. No adjustments were recorded when reasonable estimates could not be determined. These provisional estimates will be revised as information becomes available and guidance is issued by the Internal Revenue Service, and changes in Applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rates could have a material impact on Applied’s results of operations and financial condition.Consistent with the international nature of its business, Applied conducts certain manufacturing, supply chain, and other operations in Asia, bringing these activities closer to customers and reducing operating costs. In certain foreign jurisdictions, conditional reduced income tax rates have been granted to Applied. To obtain the benefit of these tax incentives, Applied must meet requirements relating to various activities. Applied’s ability to realize benefits from these incentives could be materially affected if, among other things, applicable requirements are not met or Applied incurs net losses in these jurisdictions.In addition, Applied is subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and from time to time amends previously filed tax returns. Applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes, which requires estimates and judgments. Although Applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will agree with such estimates. Applied may have to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the estimates, which may be time-consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that Applied will be successful or that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in Applied’s historical income tax provisions and effective tax rates.23Table of ContentsApplied is subject to risks associated with environmental and safety regulations.Applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in connection with its global business operations, including but not limited to: regulations related to the development, manufacture and use of its products; handling, discharge, recycling and disposal of hazardous materials used in its products or in producing its products; the operation of its facilities; and the use of its real property. The failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and safety regulations could result in: significant remediation or other legal liabilities; the imposition of penalties and fines; restrictions on the development, manufacture, sale or use of certain of its products; limitations on the operation of its facilities or ability to use its real property; and a decrease in the value of its real property. Applied could be required to alter its manufacturing and operations and incur substantial expense in order to comply with environmental and safety regulations. Any failure to comply with environmental and safety regulations could subject Applied to significant costs and liabilities that could adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Applied is exposed to various risks related to the global regulatory environment.As a public company with global operations, Applied is subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions, including those related to financial and other disclosures, accounting standards, corporate governance, intellectual property, tax, trade, antitrust, employment, immigration and travel regulations, privacy, and anti-corruption. Changing, inconsistent or conflicting laws, rules and regulations, and ambiguities in their interpretation and application create uncertainty and challenges, and compliance with laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive, divert management time and attention from revenue-generating activities, and otherwise adversely impact Applied’s business operations. Violations of law, rules and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions, restrictions on Applied’s business, and damage to its reputation, and could have an adverse impact on its business operations, financial condition and results of operations"
1,AMAT,APPLIED MATERIALS INC,2017-12-15,":Risk Factors
The following risk factors could materially and adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition or results of operations and cause reputational harm, and should be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its business, in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report.The industries that Applied serves can be volatile and difficult to predict.As a supplier to the global semiconductor and display and related industries, Applied is subject to variable industry conditions, as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on several factors, including the nature and timing of technology inflections and advances in fabrication processes, the timing and requirements of new and emerging technologies and market drivers, production capacity relative to demand for chips and display technologies, end-user demand, customers’ capacity utilization, production volumes, access to affordable capital, consumer buying patterns and general economic conditions. Applied’s industries historically have been cyclical, and are subject to volatility and sudden changes in customer requirements for new manufacturing capacity and advanced technology. These changes can affect the timing and amounts of customer investments in technology and manufacturing equipment, and can have a significant impact on Applied’s net sales, operating expenses, gross margins and net income. The amount and mix of capital equipment spending between different products and technologies can have a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations.To meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves, Applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity across its businesses, and may incur unexpected or additional costs to align its business operations. During periods of increasing demand for its products, Applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand; effectively manage its supply chain; attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees; and continue to control costs. During periods of decreasing demand, Applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions; effectively manage its supply chain; and motivate and retain key employees. If Applied does not effectively manage these challenges during periods of changing demand, its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted. Even with effective allocation of resources and management of costs, during periods of decreasing demand, Applied’s gross margins and earnings may be adversely impacted.Applied is exposed to risks associated with an uncertain global economy.Uncertain global economic and business conditions, along with uncertainties in the financial markets, national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions, pose challenges to the industries in which Applied operates. Markets for semiconductors and displays depend largely on business and consumer spending and demand for electronic products. Economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain Applied customers to push out, cancel, or refrain from purchasing for equipment or services, which may have an adverse impact on Applied’s revenues, results of operations and financial condition.  Uncertain market conditions, difficulties in obtaining capital, or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, which can also result in lower sales, additional inventory or bad debt expense for Applied. Economic and industry uncertainty may similarly affect suppliers, which could impair their ability to deliver parts and negatively affect Applied’s ability to manage operations and deliver its products. These conditions may also lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect Applied’s ability to compete effectively.Uncertain economic and industry conditions also make it more challenging for Applied to forecast its operating results, make business decisions, and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations. If Applied does not appropriately manage its business operations, it could have a significant negative impact on its business performance and financial condition. Applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, which may adversely affect Applied’s ability to capitalize on opportunities. Even during periods of economic uncertainty or lower revenues, Applied must continue to invest in research and development and maintain a global business infrastructure to compete effectively and support its customers, which can have a negative impact on its operating margins and earnings.Applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. The risks to Applied’s investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate and, as a result, the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio, as well as returns on pension assets, could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges. Applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations. If any of these financial institutions becomes insolvent, it could limit Applied’s ability to access cash in the affected accounts, which could affect its ability to manage its operations.14Table of ContentsApplied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industries in which it operates.The global semiconductor, display and related industries in which Applied operates are characterized by ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries that impact demand for and the profitability of Applied’s products, including:•the nature, timing and degree of visibility of changes in end demand for electronic products, including those related to fluctuations in consumer buying patterns tied to seasonality or the introduction of new products, and the effects of these changes on customers’ businesses and on demand for Applied’s products;•increasing capital requirements for building and operating new fabrication plants and customers’ ability to raise the necessary capital;•regulatory or tax policies impacting the timing of customers’ investment in new or expanded fabrication plants;•differences in growth rates among the semiconductor, display and other industries in which Applied operates;•the increasing importance of establishing, improving and maintaining strong relationships with customers;•the increasing cost and complexity for customers to move from product design to volume manufacturing, which may slow the adoption rate of new manufacturing technology;•the need for customers to continually reduce the total cost of manufacturing system ownership;•the heightened importance to customers of system reliability and productivity and the effect on demand for fabrication systems as a result of their increasing productivity, device yield and reliability;•manufacturers’ ability to reconfigure and re-use fabrication systems which can reduce demand for new equipment;•the increasing importance of, and difficulties in, developing products with sufficient differentiation to influence customers’ purchasing decisions;•requirements for shorter cycle times for the development, manufacture and installation of manufacturing equipment;•price and performance trends for semiconductor devices and displays, and the corresponding effect on demand for such products;•the increasing importance of the availability of spare parts to maximize the time that customers’ systems are available for production;•the increasing role for and complexity of software in Applied products; and•the increasing focus on reducing energy usage and improving the environmental impact and sustainability associated with manufacturing operations.Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the semiconductor industry.The largest proportion of Applied’s consolidated net sales and profitability is derived from sales of manufacturing equipment in the Semiconductor Systems segment to the global semiconductor industry. In addition, a majority of the revenues of Applied Global Services is from sales to semiconductor manufacturers. The semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of Applied’s semiconductor equipment and service products, including:•the increasing frequency and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, and Applied’s ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes;•the increasing cost of research and development due to many factors, including shrinking geometries, the use of new materials, new and more complex device structures, more applications and process steps, increasing chip design costs, and the increasing cost and complexity of integrated manufacturing processes;•the need to reduce product development time, despite the increasing difficulty of technical challenges;•the growing number of types and varieties of semiconductors and number of applications across multiple substrate sizes;•the increasing cost and complexity for semiconductor manufacturers to move more technically advanced capability and smaller geometries to volume manufacturing, and the resulting impact on the rates of technology transition and investment in capital equipment;•challenges in generating organic growth given semiconductor manufacturers’ levels of capital expenditures and the allocation of capital investment to market segments that Applied does not serve, such as lithography, or segments where Applied’s products have lower relative market presence;•the importance of increasing market positions in segments with growing demand;15Table of Contents•semiconductor manufacturer’s ability to reconfigure and re-use equipment, and the resulting effect on their need to purchase new equipment and services;•shorter cycle times between order placements by customers and product shipment require greater reliance on forecasting of customer investment, which may lead to inventory write-offs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease gross margin;•competitive factors that make it difficult to enhance position, including challenges in securing development-tool-of-record (DTOR) and production-tool-of-record (PTOR) positions with customers;•consolidation in the semiconductor industry, including among semiconductor manufacturers and among manufacturing equipment suppliers;•shifts in sourcing strategies by computer and electronics companies that impact the equipment requirements of Applied’s foundry customers;•the concentration of new wafer starts in Korea and Taiwan, where Applied’s service penetration and service-revenue-per-wafer-start have been lower than in other regions; •investment in semiconductor manufacturing capabilities in China, which may be affected by changes in economic conditions and governmental policies in China; and•the increasing fragmentation of semiconductor markets, leading certain markets to become too small to support the cost of a new fabrication plant, while others require less technologically advanced products.If Applied does not accurately forecast, and allocate appropriate resources and investment towards addressing, key technology changes and inflections, successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new technologies, and effectively address industry trends, its business and results of operations may be adversely impacted.Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the display industry.The global display industry historically has experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment investment levels, due in part to the limited number of display manufacturers, the concentrated nature of end-use applications, production capacity relative to end-use demand, and panel manufacturer profitability. Industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced TVs, and on demand for advanced smartphones and mobile device displays, which demand is highly sensitive to cost and improvements in technologies and features. The display industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of Applied’s display products, including:•the importance of new types of display technologies, such as organic light-emitting diode (OLED), low temperature polysilicon (LTPS), flexible displays and metal oxide, and new touch panel films;•the increasing cost of research and development, and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, and Applied’s ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes;•the timing and extent of an expansion of manufacturing facilities in China, which may be affected by changes in economic conditions and governmental policies in China;•the importance of increasing market positions in products and technologies with growing demand;•the rate of transition to larger substrate sizes for TVs and to new display technologies for TVs and mobile applications, and the resulting effect on capital intensity in the industry and on Applied’s product differentiation, gross margin and return on investment; and•the variability in demand for display manufacturing equipment, concentration of display manufacturer customers and their ability to successfully commercialize new products and technologies, and uncertainty with respect to future display technology end-use applications and growth drivers.If Applied does not successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new and emerging display technologies, or if industry demand for display manufacturing equipment and technologies slows, Applied’s business and its results of operations may be adversely impacted.16Table of ContentsThe industries in which Applied operates are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market changes.Applied operates in a highly competitive environment in which innovation is critical, and its future success depends on many factors, including the development of new technologies and effective commercialization and customer acceptance of its equipment, services and related products, and its ability to increase its position in its current markets, expand into adjacent and new markets, and optimize operational performance. The development, introduction and support of a broadening set of products in a geographically diverse and competitive environment, and that may require greater collaboration with customers and other industry participants, have grown more complex and expensive over time. Furthermore, new or improved products may entail higher costs and lower profits. To compete successfully, Applied must:•identify and address technology inflections, market changes, new applications, customer requirements and end-use demand;•develop new products and disruptive technologies, improve and develop new applications for existing products, and adapt products for use by customers in different applications and markets with varying technical requirements;•differentiate its products from those of competitors, meet customers’ performance specifications, appropriately price products, and achieve market acceptance;•maintain operating flexibility to enable responses to changing markets, applications, customers and customer requirements;•enhance its worldwide operations across its businesses to reduce cycle time, enable continuous quality improvement, reduce costs, and enhance design for manufacturability and serviceability;•focus on product development and sales and marketing strategies that address customers’ high value problems and strengthen customer relationships;•effectively allocate resources between its existing products and markets, the development of new products, and expanding into new and adjacent markets;•improve the productivity of capital invested in R&D activities;•accurately forecast demand, work with suppliers and meet production schedules for its products;•improve its manufacturing processes and achieve cost efficiencies across product offerings;•adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different parts of the supply chain;•qualify products for evaluation and volume manufacturing with its customers; and •implement changes in its design engineering methodology to reduce material costs and cycle time, increase commonality of platforms and types of parts used in different systems, and improve product life cycle management.If Applied does not successfully anticipate technology inflections, develop and commercialize new products and technologies, and respond to changes in customer requirements and market trends, its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted.Applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base.Applied’s customer base is highly concentrated, and has become increasingly concentrated as a result of continued consolidation.  Applied’s customer base is also geographically concentrated. A relatively limited number of manufacturers account for a substantial portion of Applied’s business. As a result, the actions of even a single customer can expose Applied’s business and results of operations to greater volatility. The mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year, and have a significant impact on Applied’s net sales, gross margins and net income.  Applied’s products are configured to customer specifications, and changing, rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant, non-recoverable costs. If customers do not place orders, or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel orders, Applied may not be able to replace the business, which may have a significant adverse impact on its results of operations and financial condition.  The concentration of Applied’s customer base increases its risks related to the financial condition of its customers, and the deterioration in financial condition of a single customer or the failure of a single customer to perform its obligations could have a material adverse effect on Applied’s results of operations and cash flow. To the extent its customers experience liquidity constraints, Applied may incur additional bad debt expense, which may have a significant impact on its results of operations. Major customers may also seek pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to Applied, which may have a negative impact on Applied’s business, revenue and gross margins. 17Table of ContentsApplied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business.Applied has product development, engineering, manufacturing, sales and other operations distributed throughout many countries, and some of its business activities are concentrated in certain geographic areas. Moreover, in fiscal 2017, approximately 90 percent of Applied’s net sales were to customers in regions outside the United States. As a result of the global nature of its operations, Applied’s business performance and results of operations may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:•uncertain global economic and political business conditions and demands;•political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations and policies within countries that favor domestic companies over non-domestic companies, including customer- or government-supported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors;•customer- or government-supported efforts to influence Applied to conduct more of its operations and sourcing in a particular country, such as Korea and China;•variations among, and changes in, local, regional, national or international laws and regulations, including contract, intellectual property, labor, tax, and import/export laws, and the interpretation and application of such laws and regulations;•global trade issues, including the ability to obtain required import and export licenses, trade sanctions, tariffs, and international trade disputes;•ineffective or inadequate legal protection of intellectual property rights in certain countries;•positions taken by governmental agencies regarding possible national commercial and/or security issues posed by international business operations;•fluctuating raw material, commodity, energy and shipping costs or shipping delays;•geographically diverse operations and projects, and our ability to maintain appropriate business processes, procedures and internal controls, and comply with environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption and other regulatory requirements;•supply chain interruptions, and service interruptions from utilities, transportation, data hosting or telecommunications providers;•a diverse workforce with different experience levels, languages, cultures, customs, business practices and worker expectations, and differing employment practices and labor issues;•variations in the ability to develop relationships with local customers, suppliers and governments;•fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates, including the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, euro, Taiwanese dollar, Israeli shekel, Chinese yuan or Singapore dollar;•the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations around the world;•performance of third party providers of outsourced functions, including certain engineering, software development, manufacturing, information technology and other activities;•political instability, natural disasters, pandemics, social unrest, terrorism or acts of war in locations where Applied has operations, suppliers or sales, or that may influence the value chain of the industries that Applied serves;•challenges in hiring and integration of an increasing number of workers in new countries;•the increasing need for a mobile workforce to work in or travel to different regions; and•uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various countries, including for the manufacture and sale of semiconductors and displays in the developing economies of certain countries.Many of these challenges are present in China and Korea, which are experiencing significant growth of customers, suppliers and competitors to Applied. Applied further believes that China and Korea present large potential markets for its products and opportunity for growth over the long term, although at lower projected levels of profitability and margins for certain products than historically have been achieved in other regions. In addition, government authorities may impose conditions that require the use of local suppliers or partnerships with local companies, require the license or other transfer of intellectual property, or engage in other efforts to promote local businesses and local competitors, which could have a significant adverse impact on Applied’s business. 18Table of ContentsApplied is exposed to risks associated with business combinations, acquisitions and strategic investments.Applied engages in acquisitions of or investments in companies, technologies or products in existing, related or new markets for Applied. Business combinations, acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks to Applied’s business, financial condition and operating results, including but not limited to:•diversion of management’s attention and disruption of ongoing businesses;•contractual restrictions on the conduct of Applied’s business during the pendency of a proposed transaction;•inability to complete proposed transactions due to the failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals, litigation or other disputes, and any ensuing obligation to pay a termination fee;•the failure to realize expected returns from acquired businesses;•requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures and restrictions on the conduct of Applied’s existing business or the acquired business;•ineffective integration of operations, systems, technologies, products or employees, which can impact the ability to realize anticipated synergies or other benefits;•failure to commercialize technologies from acquired businesses or developed through strategic investments;•dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;•inability to capitalize on characteristics of new markets that may be significantly different from Applied’s existing markets and where competitors may have stronger market positions and customer relationships;•failure to retain and motivate key employees of acquired businesses;•the potential impact of the announcement or consummation of a proposed transaction on relationships with third parties;•potential changes in Applied’s credit rating, which could adversely impact the Company’s access to and cost of capital;•reductions in cash balances or increases in debt obligations to finance activities associated with a transaction, which reduce the availability of cash flow for general corporate or other purposes, including share repurchases and dividends;•exposure to new operational risks, rules, regulations, worker expectations, customs and practices to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where Applied has not historically conducted business;•challenges associated with managing new, more diverse and more widespread operations, projects and people;•inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key technologies;•inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company’s internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices;•impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the segment;•the risk of litigation or claims associated with a proposed or completed transaction;•unknown, underestimated or undisclosed commitments or liabilities; and•the inappropriate scale of acquired entities’ critical resources or facilities for business needs.Applied also makes strategic investments in other companies, including companies formed as joint ventures, which may decline in value or not meet desired objectives. The success of these investments depends on various factors over which Applied may have limited or no control and, particularly with respect to joint ventures, requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic partners. The risks to Applied’s strategic investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and, as a result, the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges.19Table of ContentsApplied’s indebtedness and debt covenants could adversely affect its financial condition and business.Applied has $5.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding. Under the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes, it may be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon a change of control of Applied and a contemporaneous downgrade of the notes below investment grade. Applied also has in place a $1.5 billion committed revolving credit agreement. While no amounts were outstanding under this credit agreement at October 29, 2017, Applied may borrow amounts in the future under the agreement. Applied may also enter into new financing arrangements. Applied’s ability to satisfy its debt obligations is dependent upon the results of its business operations and subject to other risks discussed in this section. Significant changes in Applied’s credit rating or changes in the interest rate environment could have a material adverse consequence on Applied’s access to and cost of capital for future financings, and financial condition. If Applied fails to satisfy its debt obligations, or comply with financial and other debt covenants, it may be in default and any borrowings may become immediately due and payable, and such default may also constitute a default under other of Applied’s obligations. There can be no assurance that Applied would have sufficient financial resources or be able to arrange financing to repay any borrowings at such time. Applied is exposed to risks associated with expanding into new and related markets and industries.As part of its growth strategy, Applied must successfully expand into related or new markets and industries, either with its existing products or with new products developed internally, or those developed in collaboration with third parties, or obtained through acquisitions. Applied’s ability to successfully expand its business into new and related markets and industries may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:•the need to devote additional resources to develop new products for, and operate in, new markets;•the need to develop new sales and technical marketing strategies, cultivate relationships with new customers and meet different customer service requirements;•differing rates of profitability and growth among multiple businesses;•Applied’s ability to anticipate demand, capitalize on opportunities, and avoid or minimize risks;•the complexity of managing multiple businesses with variations in production planning, execution, supply chain management and logistics;•the adoption of new business models, business processes and systems;•the complexity of entering into and effectively managing strategic alliances or partnering opportunities;•new materials, processes and technologies;•the need to attract, motivate and retain employees with skills and expertise in these new areas;•new and more diverse customers and suppliers, including some with limited operating histories, uncertain or limited funding, evolving business models or locations in regions where Applied does not have, or has limited, operations;•new or different competitors with potentially more financial or other resources, industry experience and established customer relationships;•entry into new industries and countries, with differing levels of government involvement, laws and regulations, and business, employment and safety practices;•third parties’ intellectual property rights; and•the need to comply with, or work to establish, industry standards and practices.In addition, Applied from time to time receives funding from United States and other government agencies for certain strategic development programs to increase its research and development resources and address new market opportunities. As a condition to this government funding, Applied may be subject to certain record-keeping, audit, intellectual property rights-sharing and/or other obligations.20Table of ContentsManufacturing interruptions or delays, or the failure to accurately forecast customer demand, could affect Applied’s ability to meet customer demand, lead to higher costs, or result in excess or obsolete inventory.Applied’s business depends on its timely supply of equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of its customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts, including components and subassemblies, from suppliers, including contract manufacturers. The inability to timely obtain sufficient quantities of parts can have an adverse impact on Applied’s manufacturing operations and ability to meet customer demand for equipment, spares and services. Some key parts are subject to long lead-times or obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the countries where Applied conducts its manufacturing. Variable industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for Applied and for companies throughout its supply chain. These conditions may cause some suppliers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other companies, or file for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations. Applied may also experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations, delays in its ability to deliver products or services, increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of:•the failure or inability to accurately forecast demand and obtain sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective basis;•volatility in the availability and cost of materials;•difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals;•shipment delays due to transportation interruptions or capacity constraints;•information technology or infrastructure failures; and•natural disasters or other events beyond Applied’s control (such as earthquakes, floods or storms, regional economic downturns, pandemics, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war), particularly where it conducts manufacturing.If a supplier fails to meet Applied’s requirements concerning quality, cost, protection of intellectual property, socially-responsible business practices, or other performance factors, Applied may transfer its business to alternative sources, which could entail manufacturing delays, additional costs, or other difficulties. If Applied is unable to meet its customers’ demand for a prolonged period due to its inability to obtain certain parts or components, it could affect its ability to manage its operations, and have an adverse impact on Applied’s business, results of operations and customer relationships. In addition, if Applied needs to rapidly increase its business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules, this may exacerbate any interruptions in Applied’s manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on Applied’s working capital. Moreover, if actual demand for Applied’s products is different than expected, Applied may purchase more/fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery of parts. If Applied purchases inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize, or if customers reduce or delay orders, Applied may incur excess inventory charges.The ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital to Applied’s success.Applied’s success, competitiveness and ability to execute on its global strategies and maintain a culture of innovation depend in large part on its ability to attract, retain and motivate employees with key skills and experience. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, management changes, Applied’s organizational structure, increasing global competition for talent, the availability of qualified employees, cost reduction activities (including workforce reductions and unpaid shutdowns), availability of career development opportunities, the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries, and the attractiveness of Applied’s compensation and benefit programs, including its share-based programs. The loss or retirement of employees present particular challenges to the extent they involve the departure of knowledgeable and experienced employees and the resulting need to identify and train existing or new workers to perform necessary functions, which may result in unexpected costs, reduced productivity, and/or difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls.21Table of ContentsApplied is exposed to various risks related to protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights.Applied’s success depends in significant part on the protection of its patents, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights. Infringement of Applied’s rights by a third party, such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts, could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for Applied. Policing any unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult and costly and Applied cannot be certain that the measures it has implemented will prevent misuse. Applied’s ability to enforce its intellectual property rights is subject to litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the protection and enforceability of those rights in some countries. If Applied seeks to enforce its intellectual property rights, it may be subject to claims that those rights are invalid or unenforceable, and others may seek counterclaims against Applied, which could have a negative impact on its business. If Applied is unable to enforce and protect intellectual property rights, or if they are circumvented, invalidated, rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, it could have an adverse impact on its competitive position and business. In addition, changes in intellectual property laws or their interpretation, such as recent changes in U.S. patent laws, may impact Applied’s ability to protect and assert its intellectual property rights, increase costs and uncertainties in the prosecution of patent applications and enforcement or defense of issued patents, and diminish the value of Applied’s intellectual property.Third parties may also assert claims against Applied and its products. Claims that Applied’s products infringe the rights of others, whether or not meritorious, can be expensive and time-consuming to defend and resolve, and may divert the efforts and attention of management and personnel. The inability to obtain rights to use third party intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could have an adverse impact on Applied’s business. In addition, Applied may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets and other confidential business information. Any such incidents and claims could severely harm Applied’s business and reputation, result in significant expenses, harm its competitive position, and prevent Applied from selling certain products, all of which could have a significant adverse impact on Applied’s business and results of operations.   Applied is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents.In the conduct of its business, Applied collects, uses, transmits and stores data on information technology systems. This data includes confidential information belonging to Applied or its customers or other business partners, as well as personally-identifiable information of individuals. Applied has experienced, and expects to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents ranging from employee error or misuse to individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, none of which have been material to the Company to date. Applied devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and other measures to protect its systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse. However, depending on their nature and scope, cybersecurity incidents could result in business disruption; the misappropriation, corruption or loss of confidential information and critical data (Applied’s and that of third parties); reputational damage; litigation with third parties; diminution in the value of Applied’s investment in research, development and engineering; data privacy issues; and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs.Applied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings.Applied from time to time is, and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement, intellectual property rights, antitrust, environmental regulations, securities, contracts, product performance, product liability, unfair competition, misappropriation of trade secrets, employment, workplace safety, and other matters. Applied also on occasion receives notification from customers who believe that Applied owes them indemnification or other obligations related to claims made against such customers by third parties.Legal proceedings and claims, whether with or without merit, and associated internal investigations, may be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct; divert management’s attention and other Applied resources; inhibit Applied’s ability to sell its products; result in adverse judgments for damages, injunctive relief, penalties and fines; and negatively affect Applied’s business. There can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings, claims or investigations.The failure to successfully implement enterprise resource planning and other information systems changes could adversely impact Applied’s business and results of operations.Applied is in the process of implementing new enterprise resource planning and related information systems in order to better manage its business operations, align its global organizations and enable future growth.  This implementation requires the commitment of significant personnel and financial resources, and entails risks to Applied’s business operations. If Applied does not successfully implement new enterprise resource planning and related information systems, or if there are delays or difficulties in implementing these systems, Applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies, and may experience interruptions in service and operational difficulties, such as its ability to track orders, timely manufacture and ship products, project inventory requirements, effectively manage its supply chain and allocate human resources, aggregate financial data and report operating results, and otherwise effectively manage its business, all of which could result in quality issues, reputational harm, lost market and revenue opportunities, and otherwise adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations.22Table of ContentsApplied may incur impairment charges to goodwill or long-lived assets.Applied has a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions. Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The review compares the fair value for each of Applied’s reporting units to its associated carrying value, including goodwill. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, declines in the market price of Applied common stock, changes in Applied’s strategies or product portfolio, and restructuring activities. Applied’s valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance. Applied may be required to record future charges to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets is determined to exist.Applied is exposed to risks associated with operating in jurisdictions with complex and changing tax laws.Applied is subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. Applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in: (1) applicable tax laws; (2) amount and composition of pre-tax income in jurisdictions with differing tax rates; (3) plans to indefinitely reinvest certain funds held outside of the U.S.; and (4) valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. An increase in Applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on Applied’s results of operations and financial condition. As of October 29, 2017, Applied intends to indefinitely reinvest approximately $4.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries and does not plan to repatriate these funds.  Applied would need to accrue and pay U.S. taxes if these funds were repatriated. Income tax legislation in the U.S., the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act”, could possibly be enacted during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, which could impact Applied’s provision for income taxes, effective tax rate, results of operations and financial condition.  For example, under legislative proposals requiring mandatory repatriation that are being considered, Applied would need to accrue U.S. taxes on previously unrepatriated earnings. Consistent with the international nature of its business, Applied conducts certain manufacturing, supply chain, and other operations in Asia, bringing these activities closer to customers and reducing operating costs. In certain foreign jurisdictions, conditional reduced income tax rates have been granted to Applied. To obtain the benefit of these tax incentives, Applied must meet requirements relating to various activities. Applied’s ability to realize benefits from these incentives could be materially affected if, among other things, applicable requirements are not met or Applied incurs net losses in these jurisdictions.In addition, Applied is subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and from time to time amends previously filed tax returns. Applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes, which requires estimates and judgments. Although Applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will agree with such estimates. Applied may have to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the estimates, which may be time-consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that Applied will be successful or that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in Applied’s historical income tax provisions and effective tax rates.Applied is subject to risks associated with environmental and safety regulations.Applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in connection with its global business operations, including but not limited to: regulations related to the development, manufacture and use of its products; handling, discharge, recycling and disposal of hazardous materials used in its products or in producing its products; the operation of its facilities; and the use of its real property. The failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and safety regulations could result in: significant remediation or other legal liabilities; the imposition of penalties and fines; restrictions on the development, manufacture, sale or use of certain of its products; limitations on the operation of its facilities or ability to use its real property; and a decrease in the value of its real property. Applied could be required to alter its manufacturing and operations and incur substantial expense in order to comply with environmental and safety regulations. Any failure to comply with environmental and safety regulations could subject Applied to significant costs and liabilities that could adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations.23Table of ContentsApplied is exposed to various risks related to the global regulatory environment.As a public company with global operations, Applied is subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions, including those related to financial and other disclosures, corporate governance, intellectual property, tax, trade, antitrust, employment, immigration and travel regulations, privacy, and anti-corruption. Changing, inconsistent or conflicting laws, rules and regulations, and ambiguities in their interpretation and application create uncertainty and challenges, and compliance with laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive, divert management time and attention from revenue-generating activities, and otherwise adversely impact Applied’s business operations. Violations of law, rules and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions, restrictions on Applied’s business, and damage to its reputation, and could have an adverse impact on its business operations, financial condition and results of operations. "
14,AMAT,APPLIED MATERIALS INC,2016-12-15,":Risk Factors
The following risk factors could materially and adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition or results of operations and cause reputational harm, and should be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its business, in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report.The industries that Applied serves can be volatile and difficult to predict.As a supplier to the global semiconductor and display and related industries, Applied is subject to business cycles, the timing, length and volatility of which can be difficult to predict and which vary among its businesses. These industries historically have been cyclical and are subject to volatility and sudden changes in customer requirements for new manufacturing capacity and advanced technology, which depend on several factors, including general economic conditions, end-user demand, customers’ capacity utilization, production volumes, access to affordable capital, consumer buying patterns, inventory levels relative to demand, and technology transitions. These changes can affect the timing and amounts of customer investments in technology and manufacturing equipment, and can have a significant impact on Applied’s net sales, operating expenses, gross margins and net income. The amount and mix of capital equipment spending between different products and technologies can have a significant impact on the results of operations of Applied’s Semiconductor Systems segment, which is the largest contributor to its consolidated net sales.To meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves, Applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity across its businesses, and may incur unexpected or additional costs to align its business operations. During periods of increasing demand for its products, Applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand; effectively manage its supply chain; attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees; and continue to control costs. During periods of decreasing demand, Applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions; effectively manage its supply chain; and motivate and retain key employees. If Applied does not effectively manage these challenges during periods of changing demand, its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted. Even with effective allocation of resources and management of costs, during periods of decreasing demand, Applied’s gross margins and earnings may be adversely impacted.Applied is exposed to risks associated with an uncertain global economy.Uncertain global economic and business conditions, along with uncertainties in the financial markets, national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions, pose challenges to the industries in which Applied operates. Markets for semiconductors and displays depend largely on business and consumer spending and demand for electronic products. Economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain Applied customers to push out, cancel, or refrain from purchasing for equipment or services, which may have an adverse impact on Applied’s revenues, results of operations and financial condition. Uncertain market conditions, difficulties in obtaining capital, or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, which can also result in lower sales, additional inventory or bad debt expense for Applied. Economic and industry uncertainty may similarly affect suppliers, which could impair their ability to deliver parts and negatively affect Applied’s ability to manage operations and deliver its products. These conditions may also lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect Applied’s ability to compete effectively.Uncertain economic and industry conditions also make it more challenging for Applied to forecast its operating results, make business decisions, and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations. If Applied does not appropriately manage its business operations, it could have a significant negative impact on its business performance and financial condition. Applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, which may adversely affect Applied’s ability to capitalize on opportunities. Even during periods of economic uncertainty or lower revenues, Applied must continue to invest in research and development and maintain a global business infrastructure to compete effectively and support its customers, which can have a negative impact on its operating margins and earnings.Applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. The risks to Applied’s investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate and, as a result, the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio, as well as returns on pension assets, could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges. Applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations. If any of these financial institutions becomes insolvent, it could limit Applied’s ability to access cash in the affected accounts, which could affect its ability to manage its operations.14Table of ContentsApplied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industries in which it operates.The global semiconductor, display and related industries in which Applied operates are characterized by ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries that impact demand for and the profitability of Applied’s products, including:•the nature, timing and degree of visibility of changes in end demand for electronic products, including those related to fluctuations in consumer buying patterns tied to seasonality or the introduction of new products, and the effects of these changes on foundry and other customers’ businesses and on demand for Applied’s products;•increasing capital requirements for building and operating new fabrication plants and customers’ ability to raise the necessary capital;•regulatory or tax policies impacting the timing of customers’ investment in new or expanded fabrication plants;•differences in growth rates among the semiconductor, display and other industries in which Applied operates;•the increasing importance of establishing, improving and maintaining strong relationships with customers;•the increasing cost and complexity for customers to move from product design to volume manufacturing, which may slow the adoption rate of new manufacturing technology;•the need for customers to continually reduce the total cost of manufacturing system ownership;•the heightened importance to customers of system reliability and productivity and the effect on demand for fabrication systems as a result of their increasing productivity, device yield and reliability;•manufacturers’ ability to reconfigure and re-use fabrication systems which can reduce demand for new equipment;•the increasing importance of, and difficulties in, developing products with sufficient differentiation to influence customers’ purchasing decisions;•requirements for shorter cycle times for the development, manufacture and installation of manufacturing equipment;•price and performance trends for semiconductor devices and displays, and the corresponding effect on demand for such products;•the increasing importance of the availability of spare parts to maximize the time that customers’ systems are available for production;•the increasing role for and complexity of software in Applied products; and•the increasing focus on reducing energy usage and improving the environmental impact and sustainability associated with manufacturing operations.Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the semiconductor industry.The largest proportion of Applied’s consolidated net sales and profitability is derived from sales of manufacturing equipment in the Semiconductor Systems segment to the global semiconductor industry. In addition, a majority of the revenues of Applied Global Services is from sales to semiconductor manufacturers. The semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of Applied’s semiconductor equipment and service products, including:•the increasing cost of research and development due to many factors, including decreasing linewidths on a chip, the use of new materials, new and more complex device structures, more applications and process steps, increasing chip design costs, and the increasing cost and complexity of integrated manufacturing processes;•the need to reduce product development time, despite the increasing difficulty of technical challenges;•the growing number of types and varieties of semiconductors and number of applications across multiple substrate sizes;•the increasing cost and complexity for semiconductor manufacturers to move more technically advanced capability and smaller linewidths to volume manufacturing, and the resulting impact on the rates of technology transition and investment in capital equipment;•challenges in generating organic growth given semiconductor manufacturers’ levels of capital expenditures  and the allocation of capital investment to market segments that Applied does not serve, such as lithography, or segments where Applied’s products have lower relative market presence;•the importance of increasing market positions in segments with growing demand;•semiconductor manufacturer’s ability to reconfigure and re-use equipment, and the resulting effect on their need to purchase new equipment and services;15Table of Contents•the increasing frequency and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, such as 3-D transistors and advanced interconnects, and Applied’s ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes;•shorter cycle times between order placements by customers and product shipment require greater reliance on forecasting of customer investment, which may lead to inventory write-offs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease gross margin;•competitive factors that make it difficult to enhance position, including challenges in securing development-tool-of-record (DTOR) and production-tool-of-record (PTOR) positions with customers;•consolidation in the semiconductor industry, including among semiconductor manufacturers and among manufacturing equipment suppliers;•shifts in sourcing strategies by computer and electronics companies that impact the equipment requirements of Applied’s foundry customers;•the concentration of new wafer starts in Korea and Taiwan, where Applied’s service penetration and service-revenue-per-wafer-start have been lower than in other regions; •investment in semiconductor manufacturing capabilities in China, and its effect on the demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment; and•the increasing fragmentation of semiconductor markets, leading certain markets to become too small to support the cost of a new fabrication plant, while others require less technologically advanced products.If Applied does not accurately forecast, and allocate appropriate resources and investment towards addressing, key technology changes and inflections, successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new technologies, and effectively address industry trends, its business and results of operations may be adversely impacted.Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the display industry.The global display industry historically has experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment investment levels, due in part to the limited number of display manufacturers, the concentrated nature of end-use applications, production capacity relative to end-use demand, and panel manufacturer profitability. Industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced TVs, and on demand for advanced smartphones and mobile device displays, which demand is highly sensitive to cost and improvements in technologies and features. The display industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of Applied’s display products, including:•the importance of new types of display technologies, such as organic light-emitting diode (OLED), low temperature polysilicon (LTPS), flexible displays and metal oxide, and new touch panel films;•the timing and extent of an expansion of manufacturing facilities in China, which may be affected by changes in economic conditions in China;•the rate of transition to larger substrate sizes for TVs and to new display technologies for TVs and mobile applications, and the resulting effect on capital intensity in the industry and on Applied’s product differentiation, gross margin and return on investment; and•the variability in demand for display manufacturing equipment, and uncertainty with respect to future display technology end-use applications and growth drivers.If Applied does not successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new and emerging display technologies, or if industry demand for display manufacturing equipment and technologies slows, Applied’s business and its results of operations may be adversely impacted.The industries in which Applied operates are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market changes.Applied operates in a highly competitive environment in which innovation is critical, and its future success depends on many factors, including the development of new technologies and effective commercialization and customer acceptance of its equipment, services and related products. In order to successfully grow its businesses, Applied must increase its position in its current markets, expand into adjacent and new markets, and optimize operational performance. The development, introduction and support of a broadening set of products in a geographically diverse and competitive environment, and that may require greater collaboration with customers and other industry participants, have grown more complex and expensive over time. Furthermore, new or improved products may entail higher costs and lower profits. To compete successfully, Applied must:16Table of Contents•identify and address technology inflections, market changes, new applications, customer requirements and end-use demand;•develop new products and disruptive technologies, improve and develop new applications for existing products, and adapt products for use by customers in different applications and markets with varying technical requirements;•differentiate its products from those of competitors, meet customers’ performance specifications, appropriately price products, and achieve market acceptance;•maintain operating flexibility to enable responses to changing markets, applications, customers and customer requirements;•enhance its worldwide operations across its businesses to reduce cycle time, enable continuous quality improvement, reduce costs, and enhance design for manufacturability and serviceability;•focus on product development and sales and marketing strategies that address customers’ high value problems and strengthen customer relationships;•effectively allocate resources between its existing products and markets, the development of new products, and expanding into new and adjacent markets;•improve the productivity of capital invested in R&D activities;•accurately forecast demand, work with suppliers and meet production schedules for its products;•improve its manufacturing processes and achieve cost efficiencies across product offerings;•adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different parts of the supply chain;•qualify products for evaluation and volume manufacturing with its customers; and •implement changes in its design engineering methodology to reduce material costs and cycle time, increase commonality of platforms and types of parts used in different systems, and improve product life cycle management.If Applied does not successfully anticipate technology inflections, develop and commercialize new products and technologies, and respond to changes in customer requirements and market trends, its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted.Applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base.Applied’s customer base is highly concentrated, and has become increasingly concentrated as a result of continued consolidation.  Applied’s customer base is also geographically concentrated. A relatively limited number of manufacturers account for a substantial portion of Applied’s business. As a result, the actions of even a single customer can expose Applied’s business and results of operations to greater volatility. The mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year, and have a significant impact on Applied’s net sales, gross margins and net income.  Applied’s products are configured to customer specifications, and changing, rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant, non-recoverable costs. If customers do not place orders, or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel orders, Applied may not be able to replace the business, which may have a significant adverse impact on its results of operations and financial condition.  The concentration of Applied’s customer base increases its risks related to the financial condition of its customers, and the deterioration in financial condition of a single customer or the failure of a single customer to perform its obligations could have a material adverse effect on Applied’s results of operations and cash flow. To the extent its customers experience liquidity constraints, Applied may incur additional bad debt expense, which may have a significant impact on its results of operations. Major customers may also seek pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to Applied, which may have a negative impact on Applied’s business, revenue and gross margins. Applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business.Applied has product development, engineering, manufacturing, sales and other operations in many countries, and some of its business activities are concentrated in certain geographic areas. Moreover, in fiscal 2016, approximately 89 percent of Applied’s net sales were to customers in regions outside the United States. As a result of the global nature of its operations, Applied’s business performance and results of operations may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:•varying regional economic and geopolitical business conditions and demands;17Table of Contents•political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations and policies within countries that favor domestic companies over non-domestic companies, including customer- or government-supported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors;•customer- or government-supported efforts to influence Applied to conduct more of its operations and sourcing in a particular country, such as Korea and China;•variations among, and changes in, local, regional, national or international laws and regulations, including contract, intellectual property, labor, tax, and import/export laws, and the interpretation and application of such laws and regulations;•global trade issues, including the ability to obtain required import and export licenses, and international trade disputes;•ineffective or inadequate legal protection of intellectual property rights in certain countries;•positions taken by governmental agencies regarding possible national commercial and/or security issues posed by international business operations;•fluctuating raw material, commodity, energy and shipping costs or shipping delays;•geographically diverse operations and projects, which require an effective organizational structure and allocation of resources, and appropriate business processes, procedures and controls;•supply chain interruptions, and service interruptions from utilities, transportation, data hosting or telecommunications providers;•a diverse workforce with different experience levels, languages, cultures, customs, business practices and worker expectations, and differing employment practices and labor issues;•variations in the ability to develop relationships with local customers, suppliers and governments;•fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates, including the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, euro, Taiwanese dollar, Israeli shekel, Chinese yuan or Singapore dollar;•the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations around the world;•political instability, natural disasters, pandemics, social unrest, terrorism or acts of war in locations where Applied has operations, suppliers or sales, or that may influence the value chain of the industries that Applied serves;•hiring and integration of an increasing number of workers in new countries;•the increasing need for a mobile workforce to work in or travel to different regions; and•uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various countries, including for the manufacture and sale of semiconductors and displays in the developing economies of certain countries.Many of these challenges are present in China and Korea, which are experiencing significant growth of customers, suppliers and competitors to Applied. Applied further believes that China and Korea present large potential markets for its products and opportunity for growth over the long term, although at lower projected levels of profitability and margins for certain products than historically have been achieved in other regions. In addition, government authorities may impose conditions that require the use of local suppliers or partnerships with local companies, require the license or other transfer of intellectual property, or engage in other efforts to promote local businesses and local competitors, which could have a significant adverse impact on Applied’s business. Applied is exposed to risks associated with business combinations, acquisitions and strategic investments.Applied engages in acquisitions of or investments in companies, technologies or products in existing, related or new markets for Applied. Business combinations, acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks to Applied’s business, financial condition and operating results, including but not limited to:•diversion of management’s attention and disruption of ongoing businesses;•contractual restrictions on the conduct of Applied’s business during the pendency of a proposed transaction;•inability to complete proposed transactions due to the failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals, litigation or other disputes, and any ensuing obligation to pay a termination fee;•the failure to realize expected returns from acquired businesses;•requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures and restrictions on the conduct of Applied’s existing business or the acquired business;•ineffective integration of operations, systems, technologies, products or employees, which can impact the ability to realize anticipated synergies or other benefits;18Table of Contents•failure to commercialize technologies from acquired businesses or developed through strategic investments;•dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;•inability to capitalize on characteristics of new markets that may be significantly different from Applied’s existing markets and where competitors may have stronger market positions and customer relationships;•failure to retain and motivate key employees of acquired businesses;•the potential impact of the announcement or consummation of a proposed transaction on relationships with third parties;•potential changes in Applied’s credit rating, which could adversely impact the Company’s access to and cost of capital;•reductions in cash balances or increases in debt obligations to finance activities associated with a transaction, which reduce the availability of cash flow for general corporate or other purposes, including share repurchases and dividends;•exposure to new operational risks, rules, regulations, worker expectations, customs and practices to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where Applied has not historically conducted business;•challenges associated with managing new, more diverse and more widespread operations, projects and people;•inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key technologies;•inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company’s internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices;•impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the segment;•the risk of litigation or claims associated with a proposed or completed transaction;•unknown, underestimated or undisclosed commitments or liabilities; and•the inappropriate scale of acquired entities’ critical resources or facilities for business needs.Applied also makes strategic investments in other companies, including companies formed as joint ventures, which may decline in value or not meet desired objectives. The success of these investments depends on various factors over which Applied may have limited or no control and, particularly with respect to joint ventures, requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic partners. The risks to Applied’s strategic investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and, as a result, the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges. Applied’s indebtedness and debt covenants could adversely affect its financial condition and business.Applied has $3.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding. Under the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes, it may be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon a change of control of Applied and a contemporaneous downgrade of the notes below investment grade. Applied also has in place a $1.5 billion committed revolving credit agreement. While no amounts were outstanding under this credit agreement at October 30, 2016, Applied may borrow amounts in the future under the agreement. Applied may also enter into new financing arrangements. Applied’s ability to satisfy its debt obligations is dependent upon the results of its business operations and subject to other risks discussed in this section. Significant changes in Applied’s credit rating or changes in the interest rate environment could have a material adverse consequence on Applied’s access to and cost of capital for future financings, and financial condition. If Applied fails to satisfy its debt obligations, or comply with financial and other debt covenants, it may be in default and any borrowings may become immediately due and payable, and such default may also constitute a default under other of Applied’s obligations. There can be no assurance that Applied would have sufficient financial resources or be able to arrange financing to repay any borrowings at such time. Applied is exposed to risks associated with expanding into new and related markets and industries.As part of its growth strategy, Applied must successfully expand into related or new markets and industries, either with its existing products or with new products developed internally, or those developed in collaboration with third parties, or obtained through acquisitions. Applied’s ability to successfully expand its business into new and related markets and industries may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:•the need to devote additional resources to develop new products for, and operate in, new markets;•the need to develop new sales and technical marketing strategies, cultivate relationships with new customers and meet different customer service requirements;19Table of Contents•differing rates of profitability and growth among multiple businesses;•Applied’s ability to anticipate demand, capitalize on opportunities, and avoid or minimize risks;•the complexity of managing multiple businesses with variations in production planning, execution, supply chain management and logistics;•the adoption of new business models, business processes and systems;•the complexity of entering into and effectively managing strategic alliances or partnering opportunities;•new materials, processes and technologies;•the need to attract, motivate and retain employees with skills and expertise in these new areas;•new and more diverse customers and suppliers, including some with limited operating histories, uncertain or limited funding, evolving business models or locations in regions where Applied does not have, or has limited, operations;•new or different competitors with potentially more financial or other resources, industry experience and established customer relationships;•entry into new industries and countries, with differing levels of government involvement, laws and regulations, and business, employment and safety practices;•third parties’ intellectual property rights; and•the need to comply with, or work to establish, industry standards and practices.In addition, Applied from time to time receives funding from United States and other government agencies for certain strategic development programs to increase its research and development resources and address new market opportunities. As a condition to this government funding, Applied may be subject to certain record-keeping, audit, intellectual property rights-sharing and/or other obligations.Manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect Applied’s ability to meet customer demand and lead to higher costs, while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory.Applied’s business depends on its timely supply of equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of its customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts, including components and subassemblies, from suppliers, including contract manufacturers. Some key parts are subject to long lead-times or obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the countries where Applied conducts its manufacturing, including China and Korea. Variable industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for Applied and for companies throughout its supply chain. These conditions may cause some suppliers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other companies, or file for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations. Applied may also experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations, delays in its ability to deliver products or services, increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of:•the failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective basis;•volatility in the availability and cost of materials, including rare earth elements;•difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals;•shipment delays due to transportation interruptions or capacity constraints;•information technology or infrastructure failures; and•natural disasters or other events beyond Applied’s control (such as earthquakes, floods or storms, regional economic downturns, pandemics, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war), particularly where it conducts manufacturing.If a supplier fails to meet Applied’s requirements concerning quality, cost, protection of intellectual property, socially-responsible business practices, or other performance factors, Applied may transfer its business to alternative sources, which could entail manufacturing delays, additional costs, or other difficulties. If Applied is unable to meet its customers’ demand for a prolonged period due to its inability to obtain certain parts or components, it could affect its ability to manage its operations, and have an adverse impact on Applied’s business, results of operations and customer relationships. In addition, if Applied needs to rapidly increase its business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules, this may exacerbate any interruptions in Applied’s manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on Applied’s working capital. Moreover, if actual demand for Applied’s products is different than expected, Applied may purchase more/fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery of parts. If Applied purchases inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize, or if customers reduce or delay orders, Applied may incur excess inventory charges. 20Table of ContentsThe ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital to Applied’s success.Applied’s success, competitiveness and ability to execute on its global strategies and maintain a culture of innovation depend in large part on its ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, management changes, Applied’s organizational structure, global competition for talent and the availability of qualified employees, cost reduction activities (including workforce reductions and unpaid shutdowns), availability of career development opportunities, the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries, and the effectiveness of Applied’s compensation and benefit programs, including its share-based programs. Restructuring programs present particular challenges to the extent they involve the departure of knowledgeable and experienced employees and the resulting need to identify and train existing or new workers to perform necessary functions, which may result in unexpected costs, reduced productivity, and/or difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls.Applied is exposed to various risks related to protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights.Applied’s success depends in significant part on the protection of its patents, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights. Infringement of Applied’s rights by a third party, such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts, could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for Applied. Policing any unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult and costly and Applied cannot be certain that the measures it has implemented will prevent misuse. Applied’s ability to enforce its intellectual property rights is subject to litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the protection and enforceability of those rights in some countries. If Applied seeks to enforce its intellectual property rights, it may be subject to claims that those rights are invalid or unenforceable, and others may seek counterclaims against Applied, which could have a negative impact on its business. If Applied is unable to enforce and protect intellectual property rights, or if they are circumvented, invalidated, rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, it could have an adverse impact on its competitive position and business. In addition, changes in intellectual property laws or their interpretation, such as recent changes in U.S. patent laws, may impact Applied’s ability to protect and assert its intellectual property rights, increase costs and uncertainties in the prosecution of patent applications and enforcement or defense of issued patents, and diminish the value of Applied’s intellectual property.Third parties may also assert claims against Applied and its products. Claims that Applied’s products infringe the rights of others, whether or not meritorious, can be expensive and time-consuming to defend and resolve, and may divert the efforts and attention of management and personnel. The inability to obtain rights to use third party intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could have an adverse impact on Applied’s business. In addition, Applied may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets and other confidential business information. Any such incidents and claims could severely harm Applied’s business and reputation, result in significant expenses, harm its competitive position, and prevent Applied from selling certain products, all of which could have a significant adverse impact on Applied’s business and results of operations.   Applied is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents.In the conduct of its business, Applied collects, uses, transmits and stores data on information technology systems. This data includes confidential information belonging to Applied or its customers or other business partners, as well as personally-identifiable information of individuals. Applied has experienced, and expects to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents, ranging from employee error or misuse to individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, none of which have been material to the Company to date. Applied devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and other measures to protect its systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse. However, depending on their nature and scope, cybersecurity incidents could result in business disruption; the misappropriation, corruption or loss of confidential information and critical data (Applied’s and that of third parties); reputational damage; litigation with third parties; diminution in the value of Applied’s investment in research, development and engineering; data privacy issues; and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs.Applied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings.Applied from time to time is, and in the future may be, involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement, intellectual property rights, antitrust, environmental regulations, securities, contracts, product performance, product liability, unfair competition, misappropriation of trade secrets, employment, workplace safety, and other matters. Applied also on occasion receives notification from customers who believe that Applied owes them indemnification or other obligations related to claims made against such customers by third parties.Legal proceedings and claims, whether with or without merit, and associated internal investigations, may be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct; divert management’s attention and other Applied resources; inhibit Applied’s ability to sell its products; result in adverse judgments for damages, injunctive relief, penalties and fines; and negatively affect Applied’s business. There can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings, claims or investigations. 21Table of ContentsThe failure to successfully implement and conduct outsourcing activities and other operational initiatives could adversely affect results of operations.To better align its costs with market conditions, locate closer to customers, enhance productivity, and improve efficiencies, Applied conducts certain engineering, software development, manufacturing, sourcing and other operations in regions outside the United States, including India, Taiwan, China, and Korea. Applied has implemented a distributed manufacturing model, under which certain manufacturing and supply chain activities are conducted in various countries, including Germany, Israel, Italy,  Singapore, Taiwan, the United States and other countries in Asia, and assembly of some systems is completed at customer sites. In addition, Applied outsources certain functions to third parties, including companies in the United States, India, China, Korea, Malaysia and other countries. Outsourced functions include contract manufacturing, engineering, customer support, software development, information technology support, finance and administrative activities. The expanding role of third party providers has required changes to Applied’s existing operations and the adoption of new procedures and processes for retaining and managing these providers, as well as redistributing responsibilities as warranted, in order to realize the potential productivity and operational efficiencies, assure quality and continuity of supply, and protect the intellectual property of Applied and its customers, suppliers and other partners. If Applied does not accurately forecast the amount, timing and mix of demand for products, or if contract manufacturers or other outsource providers fail to perform in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, Applied’s ability to meet customer requirements could suffer, particularly during a market upturn.In addition, Applied must regularly implement or update comprehensive programs and processes to better align its global organizations, including initiatives to enhance its supply chain and improve back office and information technology infrastructure for more efficient transaction processing. The implementation of new processes and information systems and additional functionality to the existing systems entails certain risks, including difficulties with changes in business processes that could disrupt Applied’s operations, such as its ability to track orders and timely ship products, project inventory requirements, manage its supply chain and aggregate financial and operational data. During transitions Applied must continue to rely on legacy information systems, which may be costly or inefficient, while the implementation of new initiatives may not achieve the anticipated benefits and may divert management’s attention from other operational activities, or have other unintended consequences.If Applied does not effectively develop and implement its outsourcing and relocation strategies, if required export and other governmental approvals are not timely obtained, if Applied’s third party providers do not perform as anticipated, if there are delays or difficulties in enhancing business processes or if there are delays or difficulties in implementing or enhancing information systems, Applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies, and may experience operational difficulties, increased costs (including energy and transportation), manufacturing interruptions or delays, inefficiencies in the structure and/or operation of its supply chain, loss of its intellectual property rights, quality issues, reputational harm, increased product time-to-market, and/or inefficient allocation of human resources, all of which could adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Applied may incur impairment charges to goodwill or long-lived assets.Applied has a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions. Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The review compares the fair value for each of Applied’s reporting units to its associated carrying value, including goodwill. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, declines in the market price of Applied common stock, changes in Applied’s strategies or product portfolio, and restructuring activities. Applied’s valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance. Applied may be required to record future charges to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets is determined to exist.Applied is exposed to risks associated with operating in jurisdictions with complex and changing tax laws.Applied is subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. Applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in: (1) applicable tax laws; (2) amount and composition of pre-tax income in jurisdictions with differing tax rates; (3) plans to indefinitely reinvest certain funds held outside of the U.S.; and (4) valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. An increase in Applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on Applied’s results of operations and financial condition. As of October 30, 2016, Applied intends to indefinitely reinvest approximately $3.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries and does not plan to repatriate these funds.  Applied would need to accrue and pay U.S. taxes if these funds were repatriated.22Table of ContentsConsistent with the international nature of its business, Applied conducts certain manufacturing, supply chain, and other operations in Asia, bringing these activities closer to customers and reducing operating costs. In certain foreign jurisdictions, conditional reduced income tax rates have been granted to Applied. To obtain the benefit of these tax incentives, Applied must meet requirements relating to various activities. Applied’s ability to realize benefits from these incentives could be materially affected if, among other things, applicable requirements are not met or Applied incurs net losses in these jurisdictions.In addition, Applied is subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and from time to time amends previously filed tax returns. Applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes, which requires estimates and judgments. Although Applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will agree with such estimates. Applied may have to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the estimates, which may be time-consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that Applied will be successful or that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in Applied’s historical income tax provisions and effective tax rates.Applied is subject to risks associated with environmental and safety regulations.Applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in connection with its global business operations, including but not limited to: regulations related to the development, manufacture and use of its products; handling, discharge, recycling and disposal of hazardous materials used in its products or in producing its products; the operation of its facilities; and the use of its real property. The failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and safety regulations could result in: significant remediation or other legal liabilities; the imposition of penalties and fines; restrictions on the development, manufacture, sale or use of certain of its products; limitations on the operation of its facilities or ability to use its real property; and a decrease in the value of its real property. Applied could be required to alter its manufacturing and operations and incur substantial expense in order to comply with environmental and safety regulations. Any failure to comply with environmental and safety regulations could subject Applied to significant costs and liabilities that could adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Applied is exposed to various risks related to the global regulatory environment.As a public company with global operations, Applied is subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions, including those related to financial and other disclosures, corporate governance, intellectual property, tax, trade, anti-competition, employment, immigration, privacy, and anti-corruption. Changing, inconsistent or conflicting laws, rules and regulations, and ambiguities in their interpretation and application, create uncertainty and challenges, and compliance with laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive, divert management time and attention from revenue-generating activities, and otherwise adversely impact Applied’s business operations. Violations of law, rules and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions, restrictions on Applied’s business, and damage to its reputation, and could have an adverse impact on its business operations, financial condition and results of operations. "
2,AMAT,APPLIED MATERIALS INC,2015-12-09,":Risk Factors
The following factors could materially and adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition or results of operations and cause reputational harm, and they should be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its business, in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report.The industries that Applied serves are volatile and difficult to predict.As a supplier to the global semiconductor, display, and solar industries, Applied is subject to business cycles, the timing, length and volatility of which can be difficult to predict and which vary by reportable segment. These industries historically have been cyclical due to sudden changes in customers’ requirements for new manufacturing capacity and advanced technology, which depend in part on customers’ capacity utilization, production volumes, access to affordable capital, end-use demand, consumer buying patterns, and inventory levels relative to demand, as well as the rate of technology transitions and general economic conditions. These changes have affected the timing and amounts of customers’ purchases and investments in technology, and continue to affect Applied’s orders, net sales, operating expenses and net income. In particular, the amount and mix of capital equipment spending between foundry, memory and logic customers can have a significant impact on the results of operations of our Silicon Systems segment, which is the largest contributor to Applied’s consolidated net sales and total new orders.To meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves, Applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity for each of its segments as well as across multiple segments, and may incur unexpected or additional costs to align its business operations. During periods of increasing demand for its products, Applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand; effectively manage its supply chain; attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees; and continue to control costs. During periods of decreasing demand, Applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions; effectively manage its supply chain; and motivate and retain key employees. If Applied does not effectively manage its costs during periods of decreasing demand, its gross margins and earnings may be adversely impacted.Applied is exposed to risks associated with the uncertain global economy.Uncertain global economic conditions along with uncertainties in the financial markets, national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions, and government austerity measures, are posing challenges to the industries in which Applied operates. The markets for semiconductors and displays in particular depend largely on consumer spending. Economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain Applied customers to push out, cancel, or refrain from placing orders for equipment or services, which may in turn reduce Applied's net sales, reduce backlog, and affect Applied’s ability to convert backlog to sales. Uncertain market conditions, difficulties in obtaining capital, or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, which can also result in lower sales and/or additional inventory or bad debt expense for Applied. These conditions may similarly affect key suppliers, which could impair their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for Applied’s products or added costs. In addition, these conditions may lead to strategic alliances by, or consolidation of, other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect Applied’s ability to compete effectively.Uncertainty about future economic and industry conditions also makes it more challenging for Applied to forecast its operating results, make business decisions, and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations. Applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, which may adversely affect Applied’s ability to capitalize on opportunities. In addition, Applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit, liquidity, foreign exchange, market and interest rate risks. The risks to Applied’s investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate and, as a result, the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio, as well as returns on pension assets, could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges. Applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations. If any of these financial institutions becomes insolvent, it could limit Applied’s ability to access cash in the affected accounts.14Table of ContentsApplied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industries in which it operates.The global semiconductor, display, solar and related industries in which Applied operates are characterized by ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries that impact demand for and/or the profitability of Applied's products, including:•the nature, timing and degree of visibility of changes in end demand for electronic products, including those related to fluctuations in consumer buying patterns tied to seasonality or the introduction of new products, and the effects of these changes on foundry and other customers’ businesses and, in turn, on demand for Applied’s products;•increasing capital requirements for building and operating new fabrication plants and customers’ ability to raise the necessary capital;•differences in growth rates among the semiconductor, display and solar industries;•the increasing importance of establishing, improving and maintaining strong relationships with customers;•the increasing cost and complexity for customers to move from product design to volume manufacturing, which may slow the adoption rate of new manufacturing technology;•the need to continually reduce the total cost of manufacturing system ownership;•the heightened importance to customers of system reliability and productivity and the effect on demand for fabrication systems as a result of their increasing productivity, device yield and reliability;•manufacturers’ ability to reconfigure and re-use fabrication systems;•the increasing importance of, and difficulties in, developing products with sufficient differentiation to influence customers’ purchasing decisions;•requirements for shorter cycle times for the development, manufacture and installation of manufacturing equipment;•price and performance trends for semiconductor devices, displays and solar PVs, and the corresponding effect on demand for such products;•the increasing importance of the availability of spare parts to maximize the time that customers’ systems are available for production;•the increasing role for and complexity of software in Applied products; and•the increasing focus on reducing energy usage and improving the environmental impact and sustainability associated with manufacturing operations.Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the semiconductor industry.The largest proportion of Applied’s consolidated net sales and profitability has been and continues to be derived from sales of manufacturing equipment in the Silicon Systems segment to the global semiconductor industry. In addition, a majority of the revenues of Applied Global Services is from sales of service products to semiconductor manufacturers. The semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and/or the profitability of Applied's semiconductor equipment and service products, including:•the increasing cost of research and development due to many factors, including: decreasing linewidths on a chip, the use of new materials, new and more complex device structures, more applications and process steps, increasing chip design costs, and the increasing cost and complexity of integrated manufacturing processes;•the need to reduce product development time, despite the increasing difficulty of technical challenges;•the growing number of types and varieties of semiconductors and number of applications across multiple substrate sizes;•the increasing cost and complexity for semiconductor manufacturers to move more technically advanced capability and smaller linewidths to volume manufacturing, and the resulting impact on the rates of technology transition and investment in capital equipment;•challenges in generating organic growth given semiconductor manufacturers’ levels of capital expenditures  and the allocation of capital investment to market segments that Applied does not serve, such as lithography, or segments where Applied's products have lower relative market presence;•the importance of increasing market positions in under-penetrated segments, such as etch and inspection;•semiconductor manufacturer's ability to reconfigure and re-use equipment, and the resulting effect on their need to purchase new equipment and services;•the increasing frequency and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, such as 3-D transistors and advanced interconnects, and Applied’s ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes;15Table of Contents•shorter cycle times between order placements by customers (particularly foundries) and product shipment, which may lead to inventory write-offs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease gross margin;•competitive factors that make it difficult to enhance position, including challenges in securing development-tool-of-record (DTOR) and production-tool-of-record (PTOR) positions with customers;•consolidation in the semiconductor industry, including among semiconductor manufacturers and among manufacturing equipment suppliers;•shifts in sourcing strategies by computer and electronics companies that impact the equipment requirements of Applied's foundry customers;•the concentration of new wafer starts in Korea and Taiwan, where Applied’s service penetration and service-revenue-per-wafer-start have been lower than in other regions; •the potential increasing investment in semiconductor manufacturing capabilities in China, and its effect on the demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment; and•the increasing fragmentation of semiconductor markets, leading certain markets to become too small to support the cost of a new fabrication plant, while others require less technologically advanced products.Applied must accurately forecast, and allocate appropriate resources and investment towards addressing, key technology changes and inflections in order to enable opportunities for gains.Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the display industry.The global display industry historically has experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment investment levels, due in part to the limited number of display manufacturers, the concentrated nature of end-use applications, production capacity relative to end-use demand, and panel manufacturer profitability. Industry growth has depended primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced TVs and, more recently, on demand for smartphones and other mobile devices, which demand is highly sensitive to cost and improvements in technologies and features. The display industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and/or the profitability of Applied's display products, including:•the timing and extent of an expansion of manufacturing facilities in China, which may be affected by changes in economic conditions in China;•the rate of transition to larger substrate sizes for TVs and to new display technologies for TVs and mobile applications, and the resulting effect on capital intensity in the industry and on Applied’s product differentiation, gross margin and return on investment;•the importance of new types of display technologies, such as low temperature polysilicon (LTPS), organic light-emitting diode (OLED), flexible displays and metal oxide, and new touch panel films; and•uncertainty with respect to future display technology end-use applications and growth drivers.16Table of ContentsApplied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the solar industry.Investment levels in capital equipment for the global solar industry have experienced considerable volatility. In recent years, global solar PV production capacity has exceeded end-use demand, causing customers to significantly reduce or delay investments in manufacturing capacity and new technology, or to cease operations. Recently, Applied implemented cost reduction measures in its solar business, and as a result incurred restructuring charges, asset impairments and inventory-related charges. The global solar market is characterized by ongoing changes specific to this industry that impact demand for and/or the profitability of Applied’s solar products, including:•the need to continually decrease the cost-per-watt of electricity produced by solar PV products to at or below grid parity in more global regions by, among other things, reducing operating costs and increasing throughputs for solar PV manufacturing, and improving the conversion efficiency of solar PVs;•the variability and uncertainty of government energy policies and their effect in influencing the rate of growth of the solar PV market, including the availability and amount of incentives for solar power such as tax credits, feed-in tariffs, rebates, renewable portfolio standards that require electricity providers to sell a targeted amount of energy from renewable sources, and goals for solar installations on government facilities;•the number of solar PV manufacturers and amount of global production capacity for solar PVs, primarily in China;•the assessment of duties on solar cells and modules imported from China, Taiwan and other countries;•challenges associated with marketing and selling manufacturing equipment and services to a diverse and diffuse customer base;•the availability and condition of used solar equipment, which impacts demand for new equipment;•the financial condition of solar PV customers and their access to affordable financing and capital; and•solar panel manufacturing overcapacity, which has led to weak industry operating performance and outlooks, deterioration of the solar equipment market, and a worsening of the financial condition of certain customers.Applied must continually innovate, commercialize its products, and adapt its business and product offerings to respond to competition and rapid technological changes.As Applied operates in a highly competitive environment in which innovation is critical, its future success depends on many factors, including the effective commercialization and customer acceptance of its equipment, services and related products. In addition, Applied must successfully execute its growth strategy, including enhancing its presence in existing markets, expanding into related markets, cultivating new markets and exceeding industry growth rates, while constantly improving its operational performance. The development, introduction and support of a broadening set of products in more collaborative, geographically diverse, open and varied competitive environments have grown more complex and expensive over time. Furthermore, new or improved products may entail higher costs and reduced profits. Applied’s performance may be adversely affected if it does not timely, cost-effectively and successfully:•identify and address technology inflections, market changes, new applications, customer requirements and end-use demand;•develop new products and disruptive technologies, improve and/or develop new applications for existing products, and adapt similar products for use by customers in different applications and/or markets with varying technical requirements;•differentiate its products from those of competitors and any disruptive technologies, meet customers’ performance specifications, appropriately price products, and achieve market acceptance;•maintain operating flexibility to enable different responses to different markets, customers and applications;•enhance its worldwide operations across all business segments to reduce cycle time, enable continuous quality improvement, reduce costs, and enhance design for manufacturability and serviceability;•focus on product development and sales and marketing strategies that address customers' high value problems and foster strong customer relationships;17Table of Contents•allocate resources, including people and R&D funding, among Applied’s products and between the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products, as most appropriate and effective for future growth;•reduce the cost and improve the productivity of capital invested in R&D activities;•accurately forecast demand, work with suppliers and meet production schedules for its products;•improve its manufacturing processes and achieve cost efficiencies across product offerings;•adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different parts of the supply chain;•qualify products for evaluation and, in turn, volume manufacturing with its customers; and•implement changes in its design engineering methodology, including those that enable reduction of material costs and cycle time, greater commonality of platforms and types of parts used in different systems, greater effectiveness of product life cycle management, and reduced energy usage and environmental impact.Applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base.Applied’s semiconductor customer base historically has been, and is becoming even more, highly concentrated as a result of economic and industry conditions. In fiscal 2015, two semiconductor manufacturers accounted for approximately 41 percent of the Silicon Systems segment's net sales and two customers accounted for 33 percent of Applied’s consolidated net sales. Applied’s display customer base is also highly concentrated. Applied’s customer base is also geographically-concentrated. See Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” for tabular presentations of net sales by geographic region.In addition, certain customers have experienced significant ownership or management changes, consolidated with other manufacturers, outsourced manufacturing activities, or engaged in collaboration or cooperation arrangements with other manufacturers. Customers have entered into strategic alliances or industry consortia that have increased the influence of key industry participants in technology decisions made by their partners. Also, certain customers are making an increasingly greater percentage of their respective industry’s capital equipment investments. Further, claims or litigation involving key industry participants have resulted and may continue to result in changes in their sourcing strategies and other outcomes. In this environment, contracts or orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers have accounted for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of Applied’s business. The mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. As Applied’s products are configured to customer specifications, changing, rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant, non-recoverable costs. If customers do not place orders, or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel orders, Applied may not be able to replace the business, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations. Major customers may also seek, and on occasion receive, pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to Applied. Applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business.In fiscal 2015, approximately 83 percent of Applied’s net sales were to customers in regions outside the United States. Moreover, China now represents the largest market for various electronic products, such as TVs, PCs, and smartphones. Certain of Applied’s R&D and manufacturing facilities, as well as suppliers to Applied, are also located outside the United States, including in Singapore, Taiwan, China, Korea, Israel, Germany and Italy. Applied is also expanding its business and operations in new countries. The global nature of Applied’s business and operations, combined with the need to continually improve the Company’s operating cost structure, presents challenges, including but not limited to those arising from:•varying regional and geopolitical business conditions and demands;•political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations and policies within countries that favor domestic companies over non-domestic companies, including customer- or government-supported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors;•customer- or government-supported efforts to influence Applied to conduct more of its operations and sourcing in a particular country, such as Korea and China;•variations among, and changes in, local, regional, national or international laws and regulations (including intellectual property, labor, tax, and import/export laws), as well as the interpretation and application of such laws and regulations;•global trade issues, including those related to the interpretation and application of import and export licenses, as well as international trade disputes;18Table of Contents•positions taken by governmental agencies regarding possible national commercial and/or security issues posed by international business operations;•fluctuating raw material, commodity, energy and shipping costs or shipping delays;•challenges associated with managing more geographically diverse operations and projects, which require an effective organizational structure and appropriate business processes, procedures and controls;•a more diverse workforce with different experience levels, cultures, customs, business practices and worker expectations;•variations in the ability to develop relationships with local customers, suppliers and governments;•fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates, including the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, euro, Taiwanese dollar, Israeli shekel or Chinese yuan;•the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations around the world;•political instability, natural disasters (such as earthquakes, floods or storms), pandemics, social unrest, terrorism or acts of war in locations where Applied has operations, suppliers or sales, or that may influence the value chain of the industries that Applied serves;•the need for an effective business continuity plan if a disaster or other event occurs that could disrupt business operations;•the need to regularly reassess the size, capability and location of global infrastructure and make appropriate changes;•cultural and language differences;•difficulties and uncertainties associated with the entry into new countries;•hiring and integration of an increasing number of new workers, including in countries such as India and China;•the increasing need for the workforce to be more mobile and work in or travel to different regions;•uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various countries; and•uncertainties with respect to growth rates for the manufacture and sale of semiconductors, displays and solar PVs in the developing economies of certain countries.Many of these challenges are present in China and Korea, which are experiencing significant growth of customers, suppliers and competitors to Applied. Applied further believes that China and Korea present large potential markets for its products and opportunity for growth over the long term, although at lower projected levels of profitability and margins for certain products than historically have been achieved in other regions. Applied is exposed to risks associated with business combinations, acquisitions and strategic investments.Applied has made, and in the future may make, acquisitions of or investments in companies, technologies or products in existing, related or new markets for Applied. Business combinations, acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks that vary depending on their scale and nature, including but not limited to:•diversion of management’s attention from other operational matters;•contractual restrictions on the conduct of Applied’s business during the pendency of a proposed transaction;•inability to complete proposed transactions as anticipated or at all and any ensuing obligation to pay a termination fee;•the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns;•requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures and/or restrictions on the conduct of Applied’s existing business or the acquired business;•ineffective integration of operations, systems, technologies, products or employees, which can impact the ability to realize anticipated synergies or other benefits;19Table of Contents•failure to commercialize purchased technologies;•initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;•inability to capitalize on characteristics of new markets that may be significantly different from Applied’s existing markets and where competitors may have stronger market positions and customer relationships;•failure to attract, retain and motivate key employees;•the potential impact of the announcement or consummation of a proposed transaction on relationships with third parties;•potential changes in Applied’s credit rating, which could adversely impact the Company’s access to and cost of capital;•reductions in cash balances and/or increases in debt obligations to finance activities associated with a transaction, which reduce the availability of cash flow for general corporate or other purposes;•exposure to new operational risks, rules, regulations, worker expectations, customs and practices to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where Applied has not historically conducted business;•challenges associated with managing new, more diverse and more widespread operations, projects and people;•inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key technologies;•inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company’s internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and/or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices;•impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the segment;•the risk of litigation or claims associated with a proposed or completed transaction;•unknown, underestimated and/or undisclosed commitments or liabilities; and•the inappropriate scale of acquired entities’ critical resources or facilities for business needs.Applied also makes strategic investments in other companies, including companies formed as joint ventures, which may decline in value and/or not meet desired objectives. The success of these investments depends on various factors over which Applied may have limited or no control and, particularly with respect to joint ventures, requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic partners. The risks to Applied’s strategic investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and, as a result, the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges. Applied’s indebtedness and debt covenants could adversely affect its financial condition and business.Applied has $3.35 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding. Under the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes, it may be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon a change of control of Applied and a contemporaneous downgrade of the notes below investment grade. Applied also has in place a $1.5 billion committed revolving credit agreement. While no amounts were outstanding under this credit agreement at October 25, 2015, Applied may borrow amounts in the future under the agreement. Applied may also enter into new financing arrangements. Applied’s ability to satisfy its debt obligations is dependent upon the results of its business operations and other risks discussed in this section. Significant changes in Applied’s credit rating or changes in the interest rate environment could have a material adverse consequence on Applied’s access to and cost of capital for future financings, and financial condition. If Applied fails to satisfy its debt obligations, or comply with financial and other debt covenants, it may be in default and any borrowings may become immediately due and payable, and such default may also constitute a default under other of Applied’s obligations. There can be no assurance that Applied would have sufficient financial resources or be able to arrange financing to repay any borrowings at such time. Operating in multiple industries, and the entry into new markets and industries, entail additional challenges and obligations.As part of its growth strategy, Applied must successfully expand into related or new markets and industries, either with its existing products or with new products developed internally or obtained through acquisitions. The entry into different markets involves additional challenges, including those arising from:•the need to devote additional resources to develop new products for, and operate in, new markets;•the need to develop new sales and technical marketing strategies, cultivate relationships with new customers and meet different customer service requirements;•differing rates of profitability and growth among multiple businesses;•Applied’s ability to anticipate demand, capitalize on opportunities, and avoid or minimize risks;20Table of Contents•the complexity of managing multiple businesses with variations in production planning, execution, supply chain management and logistics;•the adoption of new business models, business processes and systems;•Applied’s ability to rapidly expand or reduce its operations to meet increased or decreased demand, respectively, and the associated effect on working capital;•new materials, processes and technologies;•the need to attract, motivate and retain employees with skills and expertise in these new areas;•new and more diverse customers and suppliers, including some with limited operating histories, uncertain and/or limited funding, evolving business models and/or locations in regions where Applied does not have, or has limited, operations;•new or different competitors with potentially more financial or other resources, industry experience and/or established customer relationships;•entry into new industries and countries, with differing levels of government involvement, laws and regulations, and business, employment and safety practices;•third parties’ intellectual property rights; and•the need to comply with, or work to establish, industry standards and practices.In addition, Applied from time to time receives funding from United States and other government agencies for certain strategic development programs to increase its research and development resources and address new market opportunities. As a condition to this government funding, Applied may be subject to certain record-keeping, audit, intellectual property rights-sharing and/or other obligations.Manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect Applied’s ability to meet customer demand and lead to higher costs, while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory.Applied’s business depends on its timely supply of equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of its customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts, components and subassemblies (collectively, parts) from suppliers, including contract manufacturers. Some key parts are subject to long lead-times and/or obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the countries where Applied conducts its manufacturing, including China and Korea. Cyclical industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for Applied and for companies throughout its supply chain. Further, these conditions may cause some suppliers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other companies, or file for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations. Applied may also experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations, delays in its ability to deliver products or services, increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of:•the failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective basis;•volatility in the availability and cost of materials, including rare earth elements;•difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals;•information technology or infrastructure failures; and•natural disasters or other events beyond Applied's control (such as earthquakes, floods or storms, regional economic downturns, pandemics, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war), particularly where it conducts manufacturing.If a supplier fails to meet Applied’s requirements concerning quality, cost, socially-responsible business practices, or other performance factors, Applied may transfer its business to alternative sources, which could entail manufacturing delays, additional costs, or other difficulties. In addition, if Applied needs to rapidly increase its business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules, this may exacerbate any interruptions in Applied’s manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on Applied’s working capital. Moreover, if actual demand for Applied’s products is different than expected, Applied may purchase more/fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery of parts. If Applied purchases inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize, or if customers reduce or delay orders, Applied may incur excess inventory charges. 21Table of ContentsThe ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital to Applied’s success.Applied’s success, competitiveness and ability to execute on its global strategies and maintain a culture of innovation depend in large part on its ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees, especially in critical positions. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, management changes, Applied’s organizational structure, hiring practices of competitors and other companies, cost reduction activities (including workforce reductions and unpaid shutdowns), availability of career development opportunities, the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries, and the effectiveness of Applied’s compensation and benefit programs, including its share-based programs. Restructuring programs present particular challenges to the extent they involve the departure of knowledgeable and experienced employees and the resulting need to identify and train existing or new workers to perform necessary functions, which may result in unexpected costs, reduced productivity, and/or difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls.Applied is exposed to various risks related to protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights.Applied’s success depends in significant part on the protection of its intellectual property and other rights. Infringement of Applied’s rights by a third party, such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts, could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for Applied. Policing any unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult and costly and Applied cannot be certain that the measures it has implemented will prevent  misuse. Applied’s intellectual property rights may not provide significant competitive advantages if they are circumvented, invalidated, rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, or if Applied does not adequately protect or assert these rights or obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, the laws and practices of other countries, including China, India, Taiwan and Korea, permit the protection and enforcement of Applied’s rights to varying extents, which may not be sufficient to adequately protect Applied’s rights. In addition, changes in intellectual property laws or their interpretation, such as recent changes in U.S. patent laws, may impact Applied's ability to protect and assert its intellectual property rights, increase costs and uncertainties in the prosecution of patent applications and enforcement or defense of issued patents, and diminish the value of Applied's intellectual property.   Applied is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents.In the conduct of its business, Applied collects, uses, transmits and stores data on information technology systems. This data includes confidential information belonging to Applied or its customers or other business partners, as well as personally-identifiable information of individuals. Applied has experienced, and expects to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents, ranging from employee error or misuse to individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, none of which have been material to the Company to date. Applied devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and other measures to protect its systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse. However, depending on their nature and scope, cybersecurity incidents could result in business disruption; the misappropriation, corruption or loss of confidential information and critical data (Applied's and that of third parties); reputational damage; litigation with third parties; diminution in the value of Applied's investment in research, development and engineering; data privacy issues; and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs.Applied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings.Applied from time to time is, and in the future may be, involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement, intellectual property rights, antitrust, environmental regulations, securities, contracts, product performance, product liability, unfair competition, misappropriation of trade secrets, employment, workplace safety, and other matters. Applied also on occasion receives notification from customers who believe that Applied owes them indemnification or other obligations related to claims made against such customers by third parties.Legal proceedings and claims, whether with or without merit, and associated internal investigations, may (1) be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct; (2) divert management’s attention and other Applied resources; (3) inhibit Applied’s ability to sell its products; (4) result in adverse judgments for damages, injunctive relief, penalties and fines; and/or (5) negatively affect Applied’s business. There can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings, claims or investigations. 22Table of ContentsThe failure to successfully implement and conduct outsourcing activities and other operational initiatives could adversely affect results of operations.To better align its costs with market conditions, locate closer to customers, enhance productivity, and improve efficiencies, Applied conducts certain engineering, software development, manufacturing, sourcing and other operations in regions outside the United States, including India, Taiwan, China, and Korea. Applied has implemented a distributed manufacturing model, under which certain manufacturing and supply chain activities are conducted in various countries, including Germany, Israel, Italy,  Singapore, Taiwan, the United States and other countries in Asia, and assembly of some systems is completed at customer sites. In addition, Applied outsources certain functions to third parties, including companies in the United States, India, China, Korea, Malaysia and other countries. Outsourced functions include contract manufacturing, engineering, customer support, software development, information technology support, finance and administrative activities. The expanding role of third party providers has required changes to Applied’s existing operations and the adoption of new procedures and processes for retaining and managing these providers, as well as redistributing responsibilities as warranted, in order to realize the potential productivity and operational efficiencies, assure quality and continuity of supply, and protect the intellectual property of Applied and its customers, suppliers and other partners. If Applied does not accurately forecast the amount, timing and mix of demand for products, or if contract manufacturers or other outsource providers fail to perform in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, Applied’s ability to meet customer requirements could suffer, particularly during a market upturn.In addition, Applied must regularly implement or update comprehensive programs and processes to better align its global organizations, including initiatives to enhance its supply chain and improve back office and information technology infrastructure for more efficient transaction processing. The implementation of new processes and additional functionality to the existing systems entails certain risks, including difficulties with changes in business processes that could disrupt Applied’s operations, such as its ability to track orders and timely ship products, project inventory requirements, manage its supply chain and aggregate financial and operational data. During transitions Applied must continue to rely on legacy information systems, which may be costly or inefficient, while the implementation of new initiatives may not achieve the anticipated benefits and may divert management’s attention from other operational activities, or have other unintended consequences.If Applied does not effectively develop and implement its outsourcing and relocation strategies, if required export and other governmental approvals are not timely obtained, if Applied’s third party providers do not perform as anticipated, or if there are delays or difficulties in enhancing business processes, Applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies, and may experience operational difficulties, increased costs (including energy and transportation), manufacturing interruptions or delays, inefficiencies in the structure and/or operation of its supply chain, loss of its intellectual property rights, quality issues, reputational harm, increased product time-to-market, and/or inefficient allocation of human resources.Applied may incur impairment charges to goodwill or long-lived assets.Applied has a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions. Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The review compares the fair value for each of Applied’s reporting units to its associated carrying value, including goodwill. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, declines in the market price of Applied common stock, changes in Applied’s strategies or product portfolio, and restructuring activities. Applied’s valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance. Applied may be required to record future charges to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets is determined to exist.23Table of ContentsChanges in tax rates or tax assets and liabilities could affect results of operations.As a global company, Applied is subject to taxation in the United States and various other jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. Applied’s future provision for income taxes and tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the: (1) applicable tax laws; (2) amount and composition of pre-tax income in jurisdictions with differing tax rates; (3) plans to indefinitely reinvest certain funds held outside of the U.S.; and (4) valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities.Consistent with the international nature of its business, Applied conducts certain manufacturing, supply chain, and other operations in Asia, bringing these activities closer to customers and reducing operating costs. Applied has received authorization to use tax incentives that provide that income earned in certain countries outside the U.S. will be subject to tax holidays or reduced income tax rates. To obtain the benefit of these tax incentives, Applied must meet requirements relating to various activities. Applied’s ability to realize benefits from these incentives could be materially affected if, among other things, applicable requirements are not met or Applied incurs net losses for which it cannot claim a deduction.In addition, Applied is subject to regular examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and from time to time initiates amendments to previously filed tax returns. Applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes, which requires estimates and judgments. Although Applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will agree with such estimates. Applied may have to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the estimates, which may be time-consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that Applied will be successful or that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in Applied’s historical income tax provisions and accruals.Applied is subject to risks of non-compliance with environmental and safety regulations.Applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in connection with its global business operations, including but not limited to: regulations related to the development, manufacture and use of its products; recycling and disposal of materials used in its products or in producing its products; the operation of its facilities; and the use of its real property. The failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and safety regulations, such as those related to climate change, could result in: (1) significant remediation liabilities; (2) the imposition of fines; (3) the suspension or termination of the development, manufacture, sale or use of certain of its products; (4) limitations on the operation of its facilities or ability to use its real property; and/or (5) a decrease in the value of its real property.Applied is exposed to various risks related to the regulatory environment.Applied is subject to various risks related to: (1) new, different, inconsistent or conflicting laws, rules and regulations that may be enacted by executive order, legislative bodies or regulatory agencies in the countries in which Applied operates; (2) disagreements or disputes between national or regional regulatory agencies related to international trade; and (3) the interpretation and application of laws, rules and regulations. As a public company with global operations, Applied is subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, including those related to financial and other disclosures, corporate governance, privacy, and anti-corruption. Changes and ambiguities in laws, regulations and standards create uncertainty and challenges regarding compliance matters. Efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. "
17,AMAT,APPLIED MATERIALS INC,2014-12-17,":Risk Factors
The following factors could materially and adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition or results of operations and cause reputational harm, and they should be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its business, in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report.The industries that Applied serves are volatile and difficult to predict.As a supplier to the global semiconductor, flat panel display, and solar industries, Applied is subject to business cycles, the timing, length and volatility of which can be difficult to predict and which vary by reportable segment. These industries historically have been cyclical due to sudden changes in customers’ requirements for new manufacturing capacity and advanced technology, which depend in part on customers’ capacity utilization, production volumes, access to affordable capital, end-use demand, consumer buying patterns, and inventory levels relative to demand, as well as the rate of technology transitions and general economic conditions. These changes have affected the timing and amounts of customers’ purchases and investments in technology, and continue to affect Applied’s orders, net sales, operating expenses and net income.  To meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves, Applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity for each of its segments as well as across multiple segments, and may incur unexpected or additional costs to align its business operations. During periods of increasing demand for its products, Applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand; effectively manage its supply chain; attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees; and continue to control costs. During periods of decreasing demand, Applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions; effectively manage its supply chain; and motivate and retain key employees. Applied is exposed to risks associated with the uncertain global economy.Uncertain global economic conditions and weak or moderate growth in China, Europe, and the United States, along with uncertainties in the financial markets, national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions, and government austerity measures, are posing challenges to the industries in which Applied operates. The markets for semiconductors and flat panel displays in particular depend largely on consumer spending, while the solar market depends in part on government incentives and the availability of financing for PV installations. Economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain Applied customers to push out, cancel, or refrain from placing orders for equipment or services, which may in turn reduce Applied's net sales, reduce backlog, and affect Applied’s ability to convert backlog to sales. Uncertain market conditions, difficulties in obtaining capital, or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, which can also result in lower sales and/or additional inventory or bad debt expense for Applied. These conditions may similarly affect key suppliers, which could impair their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for Applied’s products or added costs. In addition, these conditions may lead to strategic alliances by, or consolidation of, other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect Applied’s ability to compete effectively.Uncertainty about future economic and industry conditions also makes it more challenging for Applied to forecast its operating results, make business decisions, and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations. Applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, which may adversely affect Applied’s ability to capitalize on opportunities. In addition, Applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit, liquidity, foreign exchange, market and interest rate risks. The risks to Applied’s investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate and, as a result, the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio, as well as returns on pension assets, could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges. Applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations. If any of these financial institutions becomes insolvent, it could limit Applied’s ability to access cash in the affected accounts.18Table of ContentsApplied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industries in which it operates.The global semiconductor, flat panel display, solar and related industries in which Applied operates are characterized by ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries that impact demand for and/or the profitability of Applied's products, including:•the nature, timing and degree of visibility of changes in end demand for electronic products, including those related to fluctuations in consumer buying patterns tied to seasonality or the introduction of new products, and the effects of these changes on foundry and other customers’ businesses and, in turn, on demand for Applied’s products;•increasing capital requirements for building and operating new fabrication plants and customers’ ability to raise the necessary capital;•differences in growth rates among the semiconductor, display and solar industries;•the increasing importance of establishing, improving and maintaining strong relationships with customers;•the increasing cost and complexity for customers to move from product design to volume manufacturing, which may slow the adoption rate of new manufacturing technology;•the need to continually reduce the total cost of manufacturing system ownership, due in part to greater demand for lower-cost consumer electronics compared to business information technology spending;•the heightened importance to customers of system reliability and productivity and the effect on demand for fabrication systems as a result of their increasing productivity, device yield and reliability;•manufacturers’ ability to reconfigure and re-use fabrication systems;•the increasing importance of, and difficulties in, developing products with sufficient differentiation to influence customers’ purchasing decisions;•requirements for shorter cycle times for the development, manufacture and installation of manufacturing equipment;•price and performance trends for semiconductor devices, displays and solar PVs, and the corresponding effect on demand for such products;•the increasing importance of the availability of spare parts to maximize the time that customers’ systems are available for production;•the increasing role for and complexity of software in Applied products; and•the increasing focus on reducing energy usage and improving the environmental impact and sustainability associated with manufacturing operations.Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the semiconductor industry.The largest proportion of Applied’s consolidated net sales and profitability has been and continues to be derived from sales of manufacturing equipment by the Silicon Systems Group to the global semiconductor industry. In addition, a majority of the revenues of Applied Global Services is from sales of service products to semiconductor manufacturers. The semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and/or the profitability of Applied's semiconductor equipment and service products, including:•the increasing cost of research and development due to many factors, including: decreasing linewidths on a chip, the use of new materials, new and more complex device structures, more applications and process steps, increasing chip design costs, and the increasing cost and complexity of integrated manufacturing processes;•the need to reduce product development time, despite the increasing difficulty of technical challenges;•the growing number of types and varieties of semiconductors and number of applications across multiple substrate sizes;•the increasing cost and complexity for semiconductor manufacturers to move more technically advanced capability and smaller linewidths to volume manufacturing, and the resulting impact on the rates of technology transition and investment in capital equipment;•challenges in generating organic growth given semiconductor manufacturers’ levels of capital expenditures  and the allocation of capital investment to market segments that Applied does not serve, such as lithography, or segments where Applied's products have lower relative market presence;•the importance of increasing market positions in under-penetrated segments, such as etch and inspection;19Table of Contents•the growing demand for mobility products, such as tablets and smartphones, and corresponding industry investment in devices that require fewer Applied products to manufacture, such as NAND flash memory, than are needed to make  devices used in other applications, such as DRAM for personal computers; •the adoption of cloud-based memory storage particularly for mobility products, and the associated inhibiting effect on NAND bit growth rates;•the increasing frequency and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, such as 3-D transistors and advanced interconnects, and Applied’s ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes;•shorter cycle times between order placements by customers (particularly foundries) and product shipment, which may lead to inventory write-offs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease gross margin;•competitive factors that make it difficult to enhance position, including challenges in securing development-tool-of-record (DTOR) and production-tool-of-record (PTOR) positions with customers;•shifts in sourcing strategies by computer and electronics companies that impact the equipment requirements of Applied's foundry customers;•the concentration of new wafer starts in Korea and Taiwan, where Applied’s service penetration and service-revenue-per-wafer-start have been lower than in other regions; and•the increasing fragmentation of semiconductor markets, leading certain markets to become too small to support the cost of a new fabrication plant, while others require less technologically advanced products.Applied must accurately forecast, and allocate appropriate resources and investment towards addressing, key technology changes and inflections, such as the transition to 20nm devices, in order to enable opportunities for gains. In addition, the proposed industry transition from 300mm to 450mm wafers presents opportunities as well as risks and uncertainties, including those related to cost, technical complexity, timing, and the resulting effect on demand for manufacturing equipment and services.Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the flat panel display industry.The global flat panel display industry historically has experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment investment levels, due in part to the limited number of display manufacturers, the concentrated nature of end-use applications, excess production capacity relative to end-use demand, and panel manufacturer profitability. Industry growth has depended primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced TVs and, more recently, on demand for smartphones and other mobile devices, which demand is highly sensitive to cost and improvements in technologies and features. The display industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and/or the profitability of Applied's display products, including:•the timing and extent of an expansion of manufacturing facilities in China by Chinese display manufacturers and manufacturers from other countries, and the ability of non-Chinese manufacturers to obtain government approvals on a timely basis;•the rate of transition to larger substrate sizes for TVs and the resulting effect on capital intensity in the industry and on Applied’s product differentiation, gross margin and return on investment;•the importance of new types of display technologies, such as low temperature polysilicon (LTPS), organic light-emitting diode (OLED) and metal oxide, and new touch panel films, such as anti-reflective and anti-fingerprint; and•uncertainty with respect to future display technology end-use applications and growth drivers.20Table of ContentsApplied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the solar industry.Investment levels in capital equipment for the global solar industry have experienced considerable volatility. In recent years, global solar PV production capacity has exceeded end-use demand, causing customers to significantly reduce or delay investments in manufacturing capacity and new technology, or to cease operations. The global solar market is characterized by ongoing changes specific to this industry that impact demand for and/or the profitability of Applied’s solar products, including:•the need to continually decrease the cost-per-watt of electricity produced by solar PV products to at or below grid parity in more global regions by, among other things, reducing operating costs and increasing throughputs for solar PV manufacturing, and improving the conversion efficiency of solar PVs;•the variability and uncertainty of government energy policies and their effect in influencing the rate of growth of the solar PV market, including the availability and amount of incentives for solar power such as tax credits, feed-in tariffs, rebates, renewable portfolio standards that require electricity providers to sell a targeted amount of energy from renewable sources, and goals for solar installations on government facilities;•the number of solar PV manufacturers and amount of global production capacity for solar PVs, primarily in China;•the filing of regulatory unfair trade proceedings against solar PVs from China, where most of Applied’s solar equipment sales are concentrated, which has resulted in the assessment of duties on solar cells and modules imported from China and led to other trade-related conflicts and outcomes;•the varying levels of operating and industry experience among solar PV manufacturers and the resulting differences in the nature and extent of customer support services requested from Applied;•challenges associated with marketing and selling manufacturing equipment and services to a diverse and diffuse customer base;•the growth of market segments in which Applied does not participate, such as passivation and furnaces;•the availability and condition of used solar equipment, which impacts demand for new equipment;•complexities associated with government-affiliated entities as customers, for example in China;•the financial condition of solar PV customers and their access to affordable financing and capital; and•solar panel manufacturing overcapacity, which has led to weak industry operating performance and outlooks, deterioration of the solar equipment market, and a worsening of the financial condition of certain customers.Applied must continually innovate, commercialize its products, and adapt its business and product offerings to respond to competition and rapid technological changes.As Applied operates in a highly competitive environment in which innovation is critical, its future success depends on many factors, including the effective commercialization and customer acceptance of its equipment, services and related products. In addition, Applied must successfully execute its growth strategy, including enhancing its presence in existing markets, expanding into related markets, cultivating new markets and exceeding industry growth rates, while constantly improving its operational performance. The development, introduction and support of a broadening set of products in more collaborative, geographically diverse, open and varied competitive environments have grown more complex and expensive over time. Furthermore, new or improved products may entail higher costs and reduced profits. Applied’s performance may be adversely affected if it does not timely, cost-effectively and successfully:•identify and address technology inflections, market changes, new applications, customer requirements and end-use demand;•develop new products (including disruptive technologies), improve and/or develop new applications for existing products, and adapt similar products for use by customers in different applications and/or markets with varying technical requirements;•differentiate its products from those of competitors and any disruptive technologies, meet customers’ performance specifications, appropriately price products, and achieve market acceptance;•maintain operating flexibility to enable different responses to different markets, customers and applications;•enhance its worldwide operations across all business segments to reduce cycle time, enable continuous quality improvement, reduce costs, and enhance design for manufacturability and serviceability;•focus on product development and sales and marketing strategies that address customers' high value problems and foster strong customer relationships;21Table of Contents•allocate resources, including people and R&D funding, among Applied’s products and between the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products, as most appropriate and effective for future growth;•reduce the cost and improve the productivity of capital invested in R&D activities;•accurately forecast demand, work with suppliers and meet production schedules for its products;•improve its manufacturing processes and achieve cost efficiencies across product offerings;•adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different parts of the supply chain;•qualify products for evaluation and, in turn, volume manufacturing with its customers; and•implement changes in its design engineering methodology, including those that enable reduction of material costs and cycle time, greater commonality of platforms and types of parts used in different systems, greater effectiveness of product life cycle management, and reduced energy usage and environmental impact.Applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base.Applied’s semiconductor customer base historically has been, and is becoming even more, highly concentrated as a result of economic and industry conditions. In fiscal 2014, three semiconductor manufacturers accounted for approximately 54 percent of Silicon Systems Group net sales and two customers accounted for 33 percent of Applied’s consolidated net sales. Applied’s display customer base is also highly concentrated, while concentration within Applied’s solar customer base varies depending on the product line but is increasing due to challenging industry conditions. Applied’s customer base is also geographically-concentrated. See Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” for tabular presentations of net sales by geographic region.In addition, certain customers have experienced significant ownership or management changes, consolidated with other manufacturers, outsourced manufacturing activities, or engaged in collaboration or cooperation arrangements with other manufacturers. Customers have entered into strategic alliances or industry consortia that have increased the influence of key industry participants in technology decisions made by their partners. Also, certain customers are making an increasingly greater percentage of their respective industry’s capital equipment investments. Further, claims or litigation involving key industry participants have resulted and may continue to result in changes in their sourcing strategies and other outcomes. In this environment, contracts or orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers have accounted for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of Applied’s business. The mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. As Applied’s products are configured to customer specifications, changing, rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant, non-recoverable costs. If customers do not place orders, or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel orders, Applied may not be able to replace the business, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations. Major customers may also seek, and on occasion receive, pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to Applied. Applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business.In fiscal 2014, approximately 78 percent of Applied’s net sales were to customers in regions outside the United States. Moreover, China now represents the largest market for various electronic products, such as TVs, PCs, and smartphones. Certain of Applied’s R&D and manufacturing facilities, as well as suppliers to Applied, are also located outside the United States, including in Singapore, Taiwan, China, Korea, Israel, Germany and Italy. Applied is also expanding its business and operations in new countries. The global nature of Applied’s business and operations, combined with the need to continually improve the Company’s operating cost structure, presents challenges, including but not limited to those arising from:•varying regional and geopolitical business conditions and demands;•political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations and policies within countries that favor domestic companies over non-domestic companies, including customer- or government-supported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors;•customer- or government-supported efforts to influence Applied to conduct more of its operations and sourcing in a particular country, such as Korea and China;•variations among, and changes in, local, regional, national or international laws and regulations (including intellectual property, labor, tax, and import/export laws), as well as the interpretation and application of such laws and regulations;•global trade issues, including those related to the interpretation and application of import and export licenses, as well as international trade disputes;22Table of Contents•positions taken by governmental agencies regarding possible national commercial and/or security issues posed by international business operations;•fluctuating raw material, commodity, energy and shipping costs or shipping delays;•challenges associated with managing more geographically diverse operations and projects, which require an effective organizational structure and appropriate business processes, procedures and controls;•a more diverse workforce with different experience levels, cultures, customs, business practices and worker expectations;•variations in the ability to develop relationships with local customers, suppliers and governments;•fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates, including the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, euro, Taiwanese dollar, Israeli shekel or Chinese yuan;•the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations around the world;•political instability, natural disasters (such as earthquakes, floods or storms), pandemics, social unrest, terrorism or acts of war in locations where Applied has operations, suppliers or sales, or that may influence the value chain of the industries that Applied serves;•the need for an effective business continuity plan if a disaster or other event occurs that could disrupt business operations;•the need to regularly reassess the size, capability and location of global infrastructure and make appropriate changes;•cultural and language differences;•difficulties and uncertainties associated with the entry into new countries;•hiring and integration of an increasing number of new workers, including in countries such as India and China;•the increasing need for the workforce to be more mobile and work in or travel to different regions;•uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various countries; and•uncertainties with respect to growth rates for the manufacture and sale of semiconductors, displays and solar PVs in the developing economies of certain countries.Many of these challenges are present in China and Korea, which are experiencing significant growth of customers, suppliers and competitors to Applied. Applied further believes that China and Korea present large potential markets for its products and opportunity for growth over the long term, although at lower projected levels of profitability and margins for certain products than historically have been achieved in other regions. Applied is exposed to risks associated with business combinations, acquisitions and strategic investments.Applied has made, and in the future may make, acquisitions of or investments in companies, technologies or products in existing, related or new markets for Applied. Business combinations, acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks that vary depending on their scale and nature, including but not limited to:•diversion of management’s attention from other operational matters;•contractual restrictions on the conduct of Applied’s business during the pendency of a proposed transaction;•inability to complete proposed transactions as anticipated or at all and any ensuing obligation to pay a termination fee;•the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns;•requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures and/or restrictions on the conduct of Applied’s existing business or the acquired business;•ineffective integration of operations, systems, technologies, products or employees, which can impact the ability to realize anticipated synergies or other benefits;23Table of Contents•failure to commercialize purchased technologies;•initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;•inability to capitalize on characteristics of new markets that may be significantly different from Applied’s existing markets and where competitors may have stronger market positions and customer relationships;•failure to attract, retain and motivate key employees;•the potential impact of the announcement or consummation of a proposed transaction on relationships with third parties;•potential changes in Applied’s credit rating, which could adversely impact the Company’s access to and cost of capital;•reductions in cash balances and/or increases in debt obligations to finance activities associated with a transaction, which reduce the availability of cash flow for general corporate or other purposes;•exposure to new operational risks, rules, regulations, worker expectations, customs and practices to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where Applied has not historically conducted business;•challenges associated with managing new, more diverse and more widespread operations, projects and people;•inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key technologies;•inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company’s internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and/or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices;•impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the segment;•the risk of litigation or claims associated with a proposed or completed transaction;•unknown, underestimated and/or undisclosed commitments or liabilities; and•the inappropriate scale of acquired entities’ critical resources or facilities for business needs.Applied also makes strategic investments in other companies, including companies formed as joint ventures, which may decline in value and/or not meet desired objectives. The success of these investments depends on various factors over which Applied may have limited or no control and, particularly with respect to joint ventures, requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic partners. The risks to Applied’s strategic investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and, as a result, the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges. The proposed business combination with Tokyo Electron Limited may not be completed or, if completed, the intended benefits may not be fully realized.On September 24, 2013, Applied announced an agreement with Tokyo Electron Limited (TEL), a Japanese corporation and global supplier of semiconductor and flat panel display production equipment, and provider of technical support and services for semiconductor, flat panel display and PV panel production equipment, to effect a strategic combination of their respective businesses. Under the agreement, which was amended February 14, 2014, the closing of the transaction is subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approvals. The proposed business combination is subject to the risk factors described immediately above, including the risks that the combination may not be consummated in a timely manner or at all; that required  regulatory approvals may not be obtained or may be subject to conditions that reduce the estimated benefits of the combination; that the businesses, operations, systems, technologies, products or employees of Applied and TEL may not be integrated successfully; and, following completion of the transaction, that ineffective integration, changes in laws or regulations, including tax laws or other factors, may impact the combined company’s ability to realize anticipated synergies and benefits.Operating in multiple industries, and the entry into new markets and industries, entail additional challenges and obligations.As part of its growth strategy, Applied must successfully expand into related or new markets and industries, either with its existing products or with new products developed internally or obtained through acquisitions. The entry into different markets involves additional challenges, including those arising from:•the need to devote additional resources to develop new products for, and operate in, new markets;•the need to develop new sales and technical marketing strategies, cultivate relationships with new customers and meet different customer service requirements;•differing rates of profitability and growth among multiple businesses;•Applied’s ability to anticipate demand, capitalize on opportunities, and avoid or minimize risks;24Table of Contents•the complexity of managing multiple businesses with variations in production planning, execution, supply chain management and logistics;•the adoption of new business models, business processes and systems;•Applied’s ability to rapidly expand or reduce its operations to meet increased or decreased demand, respectively, and the associated effect on working capital;•new materials, processes and technologies;•the need to attract, motivate and retain employees with skills and expertise in these new areas;•new and more diverse customers and suppliers, including some with limited operating histories, uncertain and/or limited funding, evolving business models and/or locations in regions where Applied does not have, or has limited, operations;•new or different competitors with potentially more financial or other resources, industry experience and/or established customer relationships;•entry into new industries and countries, with differing levels of government involvement, laws and regulations, and business, employment and safety practices;•third parties’ intellectual property rights; and•the need to comply with, or work to establish, industry standards and practices.In addition, Applied from time to time receives funding from United States and other government agencies for certain strategic development programs to increase its research and development resources and address new market opportunities. As a condition to this government funding, Applied may be subject to certain record-keeping, audit, intellectual property rights-sharing and/or other obligations.Manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect Applied’s ability to meet customer demand and lead to higher costs, while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory.Applied’s business depends on its timely supply of equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of its customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts, components and subassemblies (collectively, parts) from suppliers, including contract manufacturers. Some key parts are subject to long lead-times and/or obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the countries where Applied conducts its manufacturing, including China and Korea. Cyclical industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for Applied and for companies throughout its supply chain. Further, these conditions may cause some suppliers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other companies, or file for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations. Applied may also experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations, delays in its ability to deliver products or services, increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of:•the failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective basis;•volatility in the availability and cost of materials, including rare earth elements;•difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals;•information technology or infrastructure failures; and•natural disasters or other events beyond Applied's control (such as earthquakes, floods or storms, regional economic downturns, pandemics, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war), particularly where it conducts manufacturing.If a supplier fails to meet Applied’s requirements concerning quality, cost, socially-responsible business practices, or other performance factors, Applied may transfer its business to alternative sources, which could entail manufacturing delays, additional costs, or other difficulties. In addition, if Applied needs to rapidly increase its business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules, this may exacerbate any interruptions in Applied’s manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on Applied’s working capital. Moreover, if actual demand for Applied’s products is different than expected, Applied may purchase more/fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery of parts. If Applied purchases inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize, or if customers reduce or delay orders, Applied may incur excess inventory charges. 25Table of ContentsThe ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital to Applied’s success.Applied’s success, competitiveness and ability to execute on its global strategies and maintain a culture of innovation depend in large part on its ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees, especially in critical positions. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, management changes, Applied’s organizational structure, hiring practices of competitors and other companies, cost reduction activities (including workforce reductions and unpaid shutdowns), availability of career development opportunities, the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries, and the effectiveness of Applied’s compensation and benefit programs, including its share-based programs. Restructuring programs present particular challenges to the extent they involve the departure of knowledgeable and experienced employees and the resulting need to identify and train existing or new workers to perform necessary functions, which may result in unexpected costs, reduced productivity, and/or difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls.Applied is exposed to various risks related to protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights.Applied’s success depends in significant part on the protection of its intellectual property and other rights. Infringement of Applied’s rights by a third party, such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts, could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for Applied. Policing any unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult and costly and Applied cannot be certain that the measures it has implemented will prevent  misuse. Applied’s intellectual property rights may not provide significant competitive advantages if they are circumvented, invalidated, rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, or if Applied does not adequately protect or assert these rights or obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, the laws and practices of other countries, including China, India, Taiwan and Korea, permit the protection and enforcement of Applied’s rights to varying extents, which may not be sufficient to adequately protect Applied’s rights. In addition, changes in intellectual property laws or their interpretation, such as recent changes in U.S. patent laws, may impact Applied's ability to protect and assert its intellectual property rights, increase costs and uncertainties in the prosecution of patent applications and enforcement or defense of issued patents, and diminish the value of Applied's intellectual property.   Applied is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents.In the conduct of its business, Applied collects, uses, transmits and stores data on information technology systems. This data includes confidential information belonging to Applied or its customers or other business partners, as well as personally-identifiable information of individuals. Applied has experienced, and expects to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents, ranging from employee error or misuse to individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, none of which have been material to the Company to date. Applied devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and other measures to protect its systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse. However, depending on their nature and scope, cybersecurity incidents could result in business disruption; the misappropriation, corruption or loss of confidential information and critical data (Applied's and that of third parties); reputational damage; litigation with third parties; diminution in the value of Applied's investment in research, development and engineering; data privacy issues; and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs.Applied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings.Applied from time to time is, and in the future may be, involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement, intellectual property rights, antitrust, environmental regulations, securities, contracts, product performance, product liability, unfair competition, misappropriation of trade secrets, employment, workplace safety, and other matters. Applied also on occasion receives notification from customers who believe that Applied owes them indemnification or other obligations related to claims made against such customers by third parties.Legal proceedings and claims, whether with or without merit, and associated internal investigations, may (1) be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct; (2) divert management’s attention and other Applied resources; (3) inhibit Applied’s ability to sell its products; (4) result in adverse judgments for damages, injunctive relief, penalties and fines; and/or (5) negatively affect Applied’s business. There can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings, claims or investigations. 26Table of ContentsThe failure to successfully implement and conduct outsourcing activities and other operational initiatives could adversely affect results of operations.To better align its costs with market conditions, locate closer to customers, enhance productivity, and improve efficiencies, Applied conducts certain engineering, software development, manufacturing, sourcing and other operations in regions outside the United States, including India, Taiwan, China, and Korea. Applied has implemented a distributed manufacturing model, under which certain manufacturing and supply chain activities are conducted in various countries, including the United States, Europe, Israel, Singapore, Taiwan and other countries in Asia, and assembly of some systems is completed at customer sites. In addition, Applied outsources certain functions to third parties, including companies in the United States, India, China, Korea, Malaysia and other countries. Outsourced functions include contract manufacturing, engineering, customer support, software development, information technology support, finance and administrative activities. The expanding role of third party providers has required changes to Applied’s existing operations and the adoption of new procedures and processes for retaining and managing these providers, as well as redistributing responsibilities as warranted, in order to realize the potential productivity and operational efficiencies, assure quality and continuity of supply, and protect the intellectual property of Applied and its customers, suppliers and other partners. If Applied does not accurately forecast the amount, timing and mix of demand for products, or if contract manufacturers or other outsource providers fail to perform in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, Applied’s ability to meet customer requirements could suffer, particularly during a market upturn.In addition, Applied must regularly implement or update comprehensive programs and processes to better align its global organizations, including initiatives to enhance the Asia supply chain and improve back office and information technology infrastructure for more efficient transaction processing. Applied also is implementing a multi-year, company-wide program to transform certain business processes or extend established processes, including enhancements or replacements to certain enterprise resource planning (ERP) software systems. The implementation of additional functionality to the ERP system entails certain risks, including difficulties with changes in business processes that could disrupt Applied’s operations, such as its ability to track orders and timely ship products, project inventory requirements, manage its supply chain and aggregate financial and operational data. During transitions Applied must continue to rely on legacy information systems, which may be costly or inefficient, while the implementation of new initiatives may not achieve the anticipated benefits and may divert management’s attention from other operational activities, negatively affect employee morale, or have other unintended consequences.If Applied does not effectively develop and implement its outsourcing and relocation strategies, if required export and other governmental approvals are not timely obtained, if Applied’s third party providers do not perform as anticipated, or if there are delays or difficulties in enhancing business processes, Applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies, and may experience operational difficulties, increased costs (including energy and transportation), manufacturing interruptions or delays, inefficiencies in the structure and/or operation of its supply chain, loss of its intellectual property rights, quality issues, reputational harm, increased product time-to-market, and/or inefficient allocation of human resources.Applied may incur impairment charges to goodwill or long-lived assets.Applied has a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions. Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The review compares the fair value for each of Applied’s reporting units to its associated carrying value, including goodwill. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, declines in the market price of Applied common stock, changes in Applied’s strategies or product portfolio, and restructuring activities. Applied’s valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance. Applied may be required to record future charges to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets is determined to exist.27Table of ContentsChanges in tax rates or tax assets and liabilities could affect results of operations.As a global company, Applied is subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. Applied’s future annual and quarterly tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the: (1) applicable tax laws; (2) amount and composition of pre-tax income in countries with differing tax rates; (3) plans of the Company to permanently reinvest certain funds held outside of the U.S.; and (4) valuation of Applied’s deferred tax assets and liabilities. As of October 26, 2014, Applied intends to permanently reinvest approximately $2.1 billion of these funds outside of the U.S. and does not plan to repatriate these funds.To better align with the international nature of its business, Applied conducts certain manufacturing, supply chain, and other operations in Asia, bringing these activities closer to customers and reducing operating costs. Applied has received authorization to use tax incentives that provide that income earned in certain countries outside the U.S. will be subject to tax holidays or reduced income tax rates. To obtain the benefit of these tax incentives, Applied must meet requirements relating to various activities. Applied’s ability to realize benefits from these incentives could be materially affected if, among other things, applicable requirements are not met or Applied incurs net losses for which it cannot claim a deduction.In addition, Applied is subject to regular examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and from time to time initiates amendments to previously filed tax returns. Applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes, which requires estimates and judgments. Although Applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will agree with such estimates. Applied may have to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the estimates, which may be time-consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that Applied will be successful or that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in Applied’s historical income tax provisions and accruals.Applied is subject to risks of non-compliance with environmental and safety regulations.Applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in connection with its global business operations, including but not limited to: regulations related to the development, manufacture and use of its products; recycling and disposal of materials used in its products or in producing its products; the operation of its facilities; and the use of its real property. The failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and safety regulations, such as those related to climate change, could result in: (1) significant remediation liabilities; (2) the imposition of fines; (3) the suspension or termination of the development, manufacture, sale or use of certain of its products; (4) limitations on the operation of its facilities or ability to use its real property; and/or (5) a decrease in the value of its real property.Applied is exposed to various risks related to the regulatory environment.Applied is subject to various risks related to: (1) new, different, inconsistent or conflicting laws, rules and regulations that may be enacted by executive order, legislative bodies or regulatory agencies in the countries in which Applied operates; (2) disagreements or disputes between national or regional regulatory agencies related to international trade; and (3) the interpretation and application of laws, rules and regulations. As a public company with global operations, Applied is subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, including those related to financial and other disclosures, corporate governance, privacy, and anti-corruption. Changes and ambiguities in laws, regulations and standards create uncertainty and challenges regarding compliance matters. Efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. "
9,AMAT,APPLIED MATERIALS INC,2013-12-04,":Risk Factors
The following factors could materially and adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition or results of operations and cause reputational harm, and they should be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its business, in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report.The industries that Applied serves are volatile and difficult to predict.As a supplier to the global semiconductor, flat panel display, and solar industries, Applied is subject to business cycles, the timing, length and volatility of which can be difficult to predict and which vary by reportable segment. These industries historically have been cyclical due to sudden changes in customers’ requirements for new manufacturing capacity and advanced technology, which depend in part on customers’ capacity utilization, production volumes, access to affordable capital, end-use demand, consumer buying patterns, and inventory levels relative to demand, as well as the rate of technology transitions and general economic conditions. These changes have affected the timing and amounts of customers’ purchases and investments in technology, and continue to affect Applied’s orders, net sales, operating expenses and net income.  To meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves, Applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity for each of its segments as well as across multiple segments, and may incur unexpected or additional costs to align its business operations. During periods of increasing demand for its products, Applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand; effectively manage its supply chain; attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees; and continue to control costs. During periods of decreasing demand, Applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions; effectively manage its supply chain; and motivate and retain key employees. Applied is exposed to risks associated with the uncertain global economy.Uncertain global economic conditions and weak or moderate growth in China, Europe, and the United States, along with uncertainties in the financial markets, national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions, and government austerity measures, are posing challenges to the industries in which Applied operates. The markets for semiconductors and flat panel displays in particular depend largely on consumer spending, while the solar market depends in part on government incentives and the availability of financing for PV installations. Economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain Applied customers to push out, cancel, or refrain from placing orders for equipment or services, which may in turn reduce Applied's net sales, reduce backlog, and affect Applied’s ability to convert backlog to sales. Uncertain market conditions, difficulties in obtaining capital, or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, which can also result in lower sales and/or additional inventory or bad debt expense for Applied. These conditions may similarly affect key suppliers, which could impair their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for Applied’s products or added costs. In addition, these conditions may lead to strategic alliances by, or consolidation of, other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect Applied’s ability to compete effectively.Uncertainty about future economic and industry conditions also makes it more challenging for Applied to forecast its operating results, make business decisions, and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations. Applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, which may adversely affect Applied’s ability to capitalize on opportunities. In addition, Applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit, liquidity, foreign exchange, market and interest rate risks. The risks to Applied’s investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate and, as a result, the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio, as well as returns on pension assets, could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges. Applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations. If any of these financial institutions becomes insolvent, it could limit Applied’s ability to access cash in the affected accounts.18Table of ContentsApplied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industries in which it operates.The global semiconductor, flat panel display, solar and related industries in which Applied operates are characterized by ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries that impact demand for and/or the profitability of Applied's products, including:•the nature, timing and degree of visibility of changes in end demand for electronic products, including those related to fluctuations in consumer buying patterns tied to seasonality or the introduction of new products, and the effects of these changes on foundry and other customers’ businesses and, in turn, on demand for Applied’s products;•increasing capital requirements for building and operating new fabrication plants and customers’ ability to raise the necessary capital;•differences in growth rates among the semiconductor, display and solar industries;•the increasing importance of establishing, improving and maintaining strong relationships with customers;•the increasing cost and complexity for customers to move from product design to volume manufacturing, which may slow the adoption rate of new manufacturing technology;•the need to continually reduce the total cost of manufacturing system ownership, due in part to greater demand for lower-cost consumer electronics compared to business information technology spending;•the heightened importance to customers of system reliability and productivity and the effect on demand for fabrication systems as a result of their increasing productivity, device yield and reliability;•manufacturers’ ability to reconfigure and re-use fabrication systems;•the increasing importance of, and difficulties in, developing products with sufficient differentiation to influence customers’ purchasing decisions;•requirements for shorter cycle times for the development, manufacture and installation of manufacturing equipment;•price and performance trends for semiconductor devices, displays and solar PVs, and the corresponding effect on demand for such products;•the increasing importance of the availability of spare parts to maximize the time that customers’ systems are available for production;•the increasing role for and complexity of software in Applied products; and•the increasing focus on reducing energy usage and improving the environmental impact and sustainability associated with manufacturing operations.Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the semiconductor industry.The largest proportion of Applied’s consolidated net sales and profitability has been and continues to be derived from sales of manufacturing equipment by the Silicon Systems Group to the global semiconductor industry. In addition, a majority of the revenues of Applied Global Services is from sales of service products to semiconductor manufacturers. The semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and/or the profitability of Applied's semiconductor equipment and service products, including:•the increasing cost of research and development due to many factors, including: decreasing linewidths on a chip, the use of new materials, new and more complex device structures, more applications and process steps, increasing chip design costs, and the increasing cost and complexity of integrated manufacturing processes;•the need to reduce product development time, despite the increasing difficulty of technical challenges;•the growing number of types and varieties of semiconductors and number of applications across multiple substrate sizes;•the increasing cost and complexity for semiconductor manufacturers to move more technically advanced capability and smaller linewidths to volume manufacturing, and the resulting impact on the rates of technology transition and investment in capital equipment;•challenges in generating organic growth given semiconductor manufacturers’ levels of capital expenditures  and the allocation of capital investment to market segments that Applied does not serve, such as lithography, or segments where Applied's products have lower relative market presence;•the importance of increasing market positions in under-penetrated segments, such as etch and inspection;19Table of Contents•the growing demand for mobility products, such as tablets and smartphones, and corresponding industry investment in devices that require fewer Applied products to manufacture, such as NAND flash memory, than are needed to make  devices used in other applications, such as DRAM for personal computers; •the adoption of cloud-based memory storage particularly for mobility products, and the associated inhibiting effect on NAND bit growth rates;•the increasing frequency and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, such as 3-D transistors and advanced interconnects, and Applied’s ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes;•shorter cycle times between order placements by customers (particularly foundries) and product shipment, which may lead to inventory write-offs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease gross margin;•competitive factors that make it difficult to enhance position, including challenges in securing development-tool-of-record (DTOR) and production-tool-of-record (PTOR) positions with customers;•shifts in sourcing strategies by computer and electronics companies that impact the equipment requirements of Applied's foundry customers;•the concentration of new wafer starts in Korea and Taiwan, where Applied’s service penetration and service-revenue-per-wafer-start have been lower than in other regions; and•the increasing fragmentation of semiconductor markets, leading certain markets to become too small to support the cost of a new fabrication plant, while others require less technologically advanced products.Applied must accurately forecast, and allocate appropriate resources and investment towards addressing, key technology changes and inflections, such as the transition to 20nm devices, in order to enable opportunities for gains. In addition, the industry transition from 300mm to 450mm wafers presents opportunities as well as risks and uncertainties, including those related to cost, technical complexity, timing, and the resulting effect on demand for manufacturing equipment and services.  Several semiconductor customers have invested in another wafer fabrication equipment supplier to help fund development of 450mm and other new technologies, which may influence the timing of technology transitions, funding allocations or other matters. Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the flat panel display industry.The global flat panel display industry historically has experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment investment levels, due in part to the limited number of display manufacturers, the concentrated nature of end-use applications, excess production capacity relative to end-use demand, and panel manufacturer profitability. Industry growth has depended primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced TVs and, more recently, on demand for smartphones and other mobile devices, which demand is highly sensitive to cost and improvements in technologies and features. The display industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and/or the profitability of Applied's display products, including:•the timing and extent of an expansion of manufacturing facilities in China by Chinese display manufacturers and manufacturers from other countries, and the ability of non-Chinese manufacturers to obtain government approvals on a timely basis;•the rate of transition to larger substrate sizes for TVs and the resulting effect on capital intensity in the industry and on Applied’s product differentiation, gross margin and return on investment;•the importance of new types of display technologies, such as low temperature polysilicon (LTPS), organic light-emitting diode (OLED) and metal oxide, and new touch panel films, such as anti-reflective and anti-fingerprint; and•uncertainty with respect to future display technology end-use applications and growth drivers.20Table of ContentsApplied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the solar industry.Investment levels in capital equipment for the global solar industry have experienced considerable volatility. In recent years, global solar PV production capacity has exceeded end-use demand, causing customers to significantly reduce or delay investments in manufacturing capacity and new technology, or to cease operations. The global solar market is characterized by ongoing changes specific to this industry that impact demand for and/or the profitability of Applied’s solar products, including:•the need to continually decrease the cost-per-watt of electricity produced by solar PV products to at or below grid parity in more global regions by, among other things, reducing operating costs and increasing throughputs for solar PV manufacturing, and improving the conversion efficiency of solar PVs;•the variability and uncertainty of government energy policies and their effect in influencing the rate of growth of the solar PV market, including the availability and amount of incentives for solar power such as tax credits, feed-in tariffs, rebates, renewable portfolio standards that require electricity providers to sell a targeted amount of energy from renewable sources, and goals for solar installations on government facilities;•the number of solar PV manufacturers and amount of global production capacity for solar PVs, primarily in China;•the filing of regulatory unfair trade proceedings against solar PVs from China, where most of Applied’s solar equipment sales are concentrated, which has resulted in the assessment of duties on solar cells and modules imported from China and led to other trade-related conflicts and outcomes;•the varying levels of operating and industry experience among solar PV manufacturers and the resulting differences in the nature and extent of customer support services requested from Applied;•challenges associated with marketing and selling manufacturing equipment and services to a diverse and diffuse customer base;•the growth of market segments in which Applied does not participate, such as passivation and furnaces;•the availability and condition of used solar equipment, which impacts demand for new equipment;•complexities associated with government-affiliated entities as customers, for example in China;•the financial condition of solar PV customers and their access to affordable financing and capital; and•solar panel manufacturing overcapacity, which has led to weak industry operating performance and outlooks, deterioration of the solar equipment market, and a worsening of the financial condition of certain customers.Applied must continually innovate, commercialize its products, and adapt its business and product offerings to respond to competition and rapid technological changes.As Applied operates in a highly competitive environment in which innovation is critical, its future success depends on many factors, including the effective commercialization and customer acceptance of its equipment, services and related products. In addition, Applied must successfully execute its growth strategy, including enhancing its presence in existing markets, expanding into related markets, cultivating new markets and exceeding industry growth rates, while constantly improving its operational performance. The development, introduction and support of a broadening set of products in more collaborative, geographically diverse, open and varied competitive environments have grown more complex and expensive over time. Furthermore, new or improved products may entail higher costs and reduced profits. Applied’s performance may be adversely affected if it does not timely, cost-effectively and successfully:•identify and address technology inflections, market changes, new applications, customer requirements and end-use demand;•develop new products (including disruptive technologies), improve and/or develop new applications for existing products, and adapt similar products for use by customers in different applications and/or markets with varying technical requirements;•differentiate its products from those of competitors and any disruptive technologies, meet customers’ performance specifications, appropriately price products, and achieve market acceptance;•maintain operating flexibility to enable different responses to different markets, customers and applications;•enhance its worldwide operations across all business segments to reduce cycle time, enable continuous quality improvement, reduce costs, and enhance design for manufacturability and serviceability;•focus on product development and sales and marketing strategies that address customers' high value problems and foster strong customer relationships;21Table of Contents•allocate resources, including people and R&D funding, among Applied’s products and between the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products, as most appropriate and effective for future growth;•reduce the cost and improve the productivity of capital invested in R&D activities;•accurately forecast demand, work with suppliers and meet production schedules for its products;•improve its manufacturing processes and achieve cost efficiencies across product offerings;•adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different parts of the supply chain;•qualify products for evaluation and, in turn, volume manufacturing with its customers; and•implement changes in its design engineering methodology, including those that enable reduction of material costs and cycle time, greater commonality of platforms and types of parts used in different systems, greater effectiveness of product life cycle management, and reduced energy usage and environmental impact.Applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base.Applied’s semiconductor customer base historically has been, and is becoming even more, highly concentrated as a result of economic and industry conditions. In fiscal 2013, three semiconductor manufacturers accounted for approximately 65 percent of Silicon Systems Group net sales and two customers accounted for 40 percent of Applied’s consolidated net sales. Applied’s display customer base is also highly concentrated, while concentration within Applied’s solar customer base varies depending on the product line but is increasing due to challenging industry conditions. Applied’s customer base is also geographically-concentrated. See Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” for tabular presentations of net sales by geographic region.In addition, certain customers have experienced significant ownership or management changes, consolidated with other manufacturers, outsourced manufacturing activities, or engaged in collaboration or cooperation arrangements with other manufacturers. Customers have entered into strategic alliances or industry consortia that have increased the influence of key industry participants in technology decisions made by their partners. Also, certain customers are making an increasingly greater percentage of their respective industry’s capital equipment investments. Further, claims or litigation involving key industry participants have resulted and may continue to result in changes in their sourcing strategies and other outcomes. In this environment, contracts or orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers have accounted for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of Applied’s business. The mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. If customers do not place orders, or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel orders, Applied may not be able to replace the business. As Applied’s products are configured to customer specifications, changing, rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant, non-recoverable costs. Major customers may also seek, and on occasion receive, pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to Applied. Applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business.In fiscal 2013, approximately 80 percent of Applied’s net sales were to customers in regions outside the United States. Moreover, China now represents the largest market for various electronic products, such as TVs, PCs, and smartphones. Certain of Applied’s R&D and manufacturing facilities, as well as suppliers to Applied, are also located outside the United States, including in Singapore, Taiwan, China, Korea, Israel, Germany and Italy. Applied is also expanding its business and operations in new countries. The global nature of Applied’s business and operations, combined with the need to continually improve the Company’s operating cost structure, presents challenges, including but not limited to those arising from:•varying regional and geopolitical business conditions and demands;•political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations and policies within countries that favor domestic companies over non-domestic companies, including customer- or government-supported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors;•customer- or government-supported efforts to influence Applied to conduct more of its operations and sourcing in a particular country, such as Korea and China;•variations among, and changes in, local, regional, national or international laws and regulations (including intellectual property, labor, tax, and import/export laws), as well as the interpretation and application of such laws and regulations;•global trade issues, including those related to the interpretation and application of import and export licenses, as well as international trade disputes;22Table of Contents•positions taken by governmental agencies regarding possible national commercial and/or security issues posed by international business operations;•fluctuating raw material, commodity, energy and shipping costs or shipping delays;•challenges associated with managing more geographically diverse operations and projects, which require an effective organizational structure and appropriate business processes, procedures and controls;•a more diverse workforce with different experience levels, cultures, customs, business practices and worker expectations;•variations in the ability to develop relationships with local customers, suppliers and governments;•fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates, including the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, euro, Taiwanese dollar, Israeli shekel or Chinese yuan;•the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations around the world;•political instability, natural disasters (such as earthquakes, floods or storms), pandemics, social unrest, terrorism or acts of war in locations where Applied has operations, suppliers or sales, or that may influence the value chain of the industries that Applied serves;•the need for an effective business continuity plan if a disaster or other event occurs that could disrupt business operations;•the need to regularly reassess the size, capability and location of global infrastructure and make appropriate changes;•cultural and language differences;•difficulties and uncertainties associated with the entry into new countries;•hiring and integration of an increasing number of new workers, including in countries such as India and China;•the increasing need for the workforce to be more mobile and work in or travel to different regions;•uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various countries; and•uncertainties with respect to growth rates for the manufacture and sale of semiconductors, displays and solar PVs in the developing economies of certain countries.Many of these challenges are present in China and Korea, which are experiencing significant growth of customers, suppliers and competitors to Applied. Applied further believes that China and Korea present large potential markets for its products and opportunity for growth over the long term, although at lower projected levels of profitability and margins for certain products than historically have been achieved in other regions. Applied is exposed to risks associated with business combinations, acquisitions and strategic investments.Applied has made, and in the future may make, acquisitions of or investments in companies, technologies or products in existing, related or new markets for Applied. Business combinations, acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks that vary depending on their scale and nature, including but not limited to:•diversion of management’s attention from other operational matters;•contractual restrictions on the conduct of Applied’s business during the pendency of a proposed transaction;•inability to complete proposed transactions as anticipated or at all and any ensuing obligation to pay a termination fee;•the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns;•requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures and/or restrictions on the conduct of Applied’s existing business or the acquired business;•ineffective integration of operations, systems, technologies, products or employees, which can impact the ability to realize anticipated synergies or other benefits;23Table of Contents•failure to commercialize purchased technologies;•initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;•inability to capitalize on characteristics of new markets that may be significantly different from Applied’s existing markets and where competitors may have stronger market positions and customer relationships;•failure to attract, retain and motivate key employees;•the potential impact of the announcement or consummation of a proposed transaction on relationships with third parties;•potential changes in Applied’s credit rating, which could adversely impact the Company’s access to and cost of capital;•reductions in cash balances and/or increases in debt obligations to finance activities associated with a transaction, which reduce the availability of cash flow for general corporate or other purposes;•exposure to new operational risks, rules, regulations, worker expectations, customs and practices to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where Applied has not historically conducted business;•challenges associated with managing new, more diverse and more widespread operations, projects and people;•inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key technologies;•inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company’s internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and/or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices;•impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the segment;•the risk of litigation or claims associated with a proposed or completed transaction;•unknown, underestimated and/or undisclosed commitments or liabilities; and•the inappropriate scale of acquired entities’ critical resources or facilities for business needs.Applied also makes strategic investments in other companies, including companies formed as joint ventures, which may decline in value and/or not meet desired objectives. The success of these investments depends on various factors over which Applied may have limited or no control and, particularly with respect to joint ventures, requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic partners. The risks to Applied’s strategic investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and, as a result, the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges. The proposed business combination with Tokyo Electron Limited may not be completed or, if completed, the intended benefits may not be fully realized.On September 24, 2013, Applied entered into an agreement with Tokyo Electron Limited (TEL), a Japanese corporation and global provider of semiconductor, flat panel display and photovoltaic panel production equipment, to effect a strategic combination of their respective businesses. The closing of the transaction is subject to customary conditions, including approval by Applied’s and TEL’s shareholders and regulatory approvals. The proposed business combination is subject to the risk factors described immediately above, including the risks that the combination may not be consummated in a timely manner or at all; that required  regulatory approvals may not be obtained or may be subject to conditions that reduce the estimated benefits of the combination; that the businesses and operations of Applied and TEL may not be integrated successfully; and, following completion of the transaction, that the inability to effectively integrate operations, systems, technologies, products or employees, or other factors, may impact the combined company’s ability to realize anticipated synergies and benefits.Operating in multiple industries, and the entry into new markets and industries, entail additional challenges and obligations.As part of its growth strategy, Applied must successfully expand into related or new markets and industries, either with its existing products or with new products developed internally or obtained through acquisitions. The entry into different markets involves additional challenges, including those arising from:•the need to devote additional resources to develop new products for, and operate in, new markets;•the need to develop new sales and technical marketing strategies, cultivate relationships with new customers and meet different customer service requirements;•differing rates of profitability and growth among multiple businesses;•Applied’s ability to anticipate demand, capitalize on opportunities, and avoid or minimize risks;24Table of Contents•the complexity of managing multiple businesses with variations in production planning, execution, supply chain management and logistics;•the adoption of new business models, business processes and systems;•Applied’s ability to rapidly expand or reduce its operations to meet increased or decreased demand, respectively, and the associated effect on working capital;•new materials, processes and technologies;•the need to attract, motivate and retain employees with skills and expertise in these new areas;•new and more diverse customers and suppliers, including some with limited operating histories, uncertain and/or limited funding, evolving business models and/or locations in regions where Applied does not have, or has limited, operations;•new or different competitors with potentially more financial or other resources, industry experience and/or established customer relationships;•entry into new industries and countries, with differing levels of government involvement, laws and regulations, and business, employment and safety practices;•third parties’ intellectual property rights; and•the need to comply with, or work to establish, industry standards and practices.In addition, Applied from time to time receives funding from United States and other government agencies for certain strategic development programs to increase its research and development resources and address new market opportunities. As a condition to this government funding, Applied may be subject to certain record-keeping, audit, intellectual property rights-sharing and/or other obligations.Manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect Applied’s ability to meet customer demand and lead to higher costs, while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory.Applied’s business depends on its timely supply of equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of its customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts, components and subassemblies (collectively, parts) from suppliers, including contract manufacturers. Some key parts are subject to long lead-times and/or obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the countries where Applied conducts its manufacturing, including China and Korea. Cyclical industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for Applied and for companies throughout its supply chain. Further, these conditions may cause some suppliers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other companies, or file for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations. Applied may also experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations, delays in its ability to deliver products or services, increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of:•the failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective basis;•volatility in the availability and cost of materials, including rare earth elements;•difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals;•information technology or infrastructure failures; and•natural disasters or other events beyond Applied's control (such as earthquakes, floods or storms, regional economic downturns, pandemics, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war), particularly where it conducts manufacturing.If a supplier fails to meet Applied’s requirements concerning quality, cost, socially-responsible business practices, or other performance factors, Applied may transfer its business to alternative sources, which could entail manufacturing delays, additional costs, or other difficulties. In addition, if Applied needs to rapidly increase its business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules, this may exacerbate any interruptions in Applied’s manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on Applied’s working capital. Moreover, if actual demand for Applied’s products is different than expected, Applied may purchase more/fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery of parts. If Applied purchases inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize, or if customers reduce or delay orders, Applied may incur excess inventory charges. 25Table of ContentsThe ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital to Applied’s success.Applied’s success, competitiveness and ability to execute on its global strategies and maintain a culture of innovation depend in large part on its ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees, especially in critical positions. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, management changes, Applied’s organizational structure, hiring practices of competitors and other companies, cost reduction activities (including workforce reductions and unpaid shutdowns), availability of career development opportunities, the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries, and the effectiveness of Applied’s compensation and benefit programs, including its share-based programs. Restructuring programs present particular challenges to the extent they involve the departure of knowledgeable and experienced employees and the resulting need to identify and train existing or new workers to perform necessary functions, which may result in unexpected costs, reduced productivity, and/or difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls.Applied is exposed to various risks related to protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights.Applied’s success depends in significant part on the protection of its intellectual property and other rights. Infringement of Applied’s rights by a third party, such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts, could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for Applied. Policing any unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult and costly and Applied cannot be certain that the measures it has implemented will prevent  misuse. Applied’s intellectual property rights may not provide significant competitive advantages if they are circumvented, invalidated, rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, or if Applied does not adequately protect or assert these rights or obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, the laws and practices of other countries, including China, India, Taiwan and Korea, permit the protection and enforcement of Applied’s rights to varying extents, which may not be sufficient to adequately protect Applied’s rights. In addition, changes in intellectual property laws or their interpretation, such as recent changes in U.S. patent laws, may impact Applied's ability to protect and assert its intellectual property rights, increase costs and uncertainties in the prosecution of patent applications and enforcement or defense of issued patents, and diminish the value of Applied's intellectual property.   Applied is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents.In the conduct of its business, Applied collects, uses, transmits and stores data on information technology systems. This data includes confidential information belonging to Applied or its customers or other business partners, as well as personally-identifiable information of individuals. Applied has experienced, and expects to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents, ranging from employee error or misuse to individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, none of which have been material to the Company to date. Applied devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and other measures to protect its systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse. However, depending on their nature and scope, cybersecurity incidents could result in business disruption; the misappropriation, corruption or loss of confidential information and critical data (Applied's and that of third parties); reputational damage; litigation with third parties; diminution in the value of Applied's investment in research, development and engineering; data privacy issues; and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs.Applied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings.Applied from time to time is, and in the future may be, involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement, intellectual property rights, antitrust, environmental regulations, securities, contracts, product performance, product liability, unfair competition, misappropriation of trade secrets, employment, workplace safety, and other matters. Applied also on occasion receives notification from customers who believe that Applied owes them indemnification or other obligations related to claims made against such customers by third parties.Legal proceedings and claims, whether with or without merit, and associated internal investigations, may (1) be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct; (2) divert management’s attention and other Applied resources; (3) inhibit Applied’s ability to sell its products; (4) result in adverse judgments for damages, injunctive relief, penalties and fines; and/or (5) negatively affect Applied’s business. There can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings, claims or investigations. 26Table of ContentsThe failure to successfully implement and conduct outsourcing activities and other operational initiatives could adversely affect results of operations.To better align its costs with market conditions, locate closer to customers, enhance productivity, and improve efficiencies, Applied conducts certain engineering, software development, manufacturing, sourcing and other operations in regions outside the United States, including India, Taiwan, China, and Korea. Applied has implemented a distributed manufacturing model, under which certain manufacturing and supply chain activities are conducted in various countries, including the United States, Europe, Israel, Singapore, Taiwan and other countries in Asia, and assembly of some systems is completed at customer sites. In addition, Applied outsources certain functions to third parties, including companies in the United States, India, China, Korea, Malaysia and other countries. Outsourced functions include contract manufacturing, engineering, customer support, software development, information technology support, finance and administrative activities. The expanding role of third party providers has required changes to Applied’s existing operations and the adoption of new procedures and processes for retaining and managing these providers, as well as redistributing responsibilities as warranted, in order to realize the potential productivity and operational efficiencies, assure quality and continuity of supply, and protect the intellectual property of Applied and its customers, suppliers and other partners. If Applied does not accurately forecast the amount, timing and mix of demand for products, or if contract manufacturers or other outsource providers fail to perform in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, Applied’s ability to meet customer requirements could suffer, particularly during a market upturn.In addition, Applied must regularly implement or update comprehensive programs and processes to better align its global organizations, including initiatives to enhance the Asia supply chain and improve back office and information technology infrastructure for more efficient transaction processing. Applied also is implementing a multi-year, company-wide program to transform certain business processes or extend established processes, including the transition to a single enterprise resource planning (ERP) software system to perform various functions. The implementation of additional functionality to the ERP system entails certain risks, including difficulties with changes in business processes that could disrupt Applied’s operations, such as its ability to track orders and timely ship products, project inventory requirements, manage its supply chain and aggregate financial and operational data. During transitions Applied must continue to rely on legacy information systems, which may be costly or inefficient, while the implementation of new initiatives may not achieve the anticipated benefits and may divert management’s attention from other operational activities, negatively affect employee morale, or have other unintended consequences.If Applied does not effectively develop and implement its outsourcing and relocation strategies, if required export and other governmental approvals are not timely obtained, if Applied’s third party providers do not perform as anticipated, or if there are delays or difficulties in enhancing business processes, Applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies, and may experience operational difficulties, increased costs (including energy and transportation), manufacturing interruptions or delays, inefficiencies in the structure and/or operation of its supply chain, loss of its intellectual property rights, quality issues, reputational harm, increased product time-to-market, and/or inefficient allocation of human resources.Applied may incur impairment charges to goodwill or long-lived assets.Applied has a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions. Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The review compares the fair value for each of Applied’s reporting units to its associated carrying value, including goodwill. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, declines in the market price of Applied common stock, changes in Applied’s strategies or product portfolio, and restructuring activities. Applied’s valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance. For example, in the second quarter of fiscal 2013, Applied recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. Applied may be required to record future charges to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets is determined to exist.27Table of ContentsChanges in tax rates or tax assets and liabilities could affect results of operations.As a global company, Applied is subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. Applied’s future annual and quarterly tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the: (1) applicable tax laws; (2) amount and composition of pre-tax income in countries with differing tax rates; (3) plans of the Company to permanently reinvest certain funds held outside of the U.S.; or (4) valuation of Applied’s deferred tax assets and liabilities.To better align with the international nature of its business, Applied conducts certain manufacturing, supply chain, and other operations in Asia, bringing these activities closer to customers and reducing operating costs. Applied has received authorization to use tax incentives that provide that income earned in certain countries outside the U.S. will be subject to tax holidays or reduced income tax rates. To obtain the benefit of these tax provisions, Applied must meet requirements relating to various activities. Applied’s ability to realize benefits from these provisions could be materially affected if, among other things, applicable requirements are not met, or if Applied incurs net losses for which it cannot claim a deduction.In addition, Applied is subject to regular examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and from time to time initiates amendments to previously filed tax returns. Applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes, which requires estimates and judgments. Although Applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will agree with such estimates. Applied may have to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the estimates, which may be time-consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that Applied will be successful or that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in Applied’s historical income tax provisions and accruals.Applied is subject to risks of non-compliance with environmental and safety regulations.Applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in connection with its global business operations, including but not limited to: regulations related to the development, manufacture and use of its products; recycling and disposal of materials used in its products or in producing its products; the operation of its facilities; and the use of its real property. The failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and safety regulations, such as those related to climate change, could result in: (1) significant remediation liabilities; (2) the imposition of fines; (3) the suspension or termination of the development, manufacture, sale or use of certain of its products; (4) limitations on the operation of its facilities or ability to use its real property; and/or (5) a decrease in the value of its real property.Applied is exposed to various risks related to the regulatory environment.Applied is subject to various risks related to: (1) new, different, inconsistent or even conflicting laws, rules and regulations that may be enacted by executive order, legislative bodies and/or regulatory agencies in the countries in which Applied operates; (2) disagreements or disputes between national or regional regulatory agencies related to international trade; and (3) the interpretation and application of laws, rules and regulations. For example, as a public company with global operations, Applied is subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, including those related to financial and other disclosures, corporate governance, privacy, and anti-corruption. Changes in laws, regulations and standards may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters. Efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. "
12,AMAT,APPLIED MATERIALS INC,2012-12-05,":Risk Factors
The following factors could materially affect Applied’s business, financial condition or results of operations and should be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its business.The industries that Applied serves are volatile and difficult to predict.As a supplier to the global semiconductor, flat panel display, and solar industries, Applied is subject to business cycles, the timing, length and volatility of which can be difficult to predict and which vary by reportable segment. These industries historically have been cyclical due to sudden changes in customers’ requirements for new manufacturing capacity and advanced technology, which depend in part on customers’ capacity utilization, production volumes, access to affordable capital, end-use demand, and inventory levels relative to demand, as well as the rate of technology transitions and general economic conditions. These changes have affected the timing and amounts of customers’ purchases and investments in technology, and continue to affect Applied’s orders, net sales, operating expenses and net income.  More recently, consumer buying patterns for electronic products, combined with growing customer concentration, have led to a seasonality effect in demand for semiconductor equipment, particularly from foundry customers.To meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves, Applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity for each of its segments as well as across multiple segments, and may incur unexpected or additional costs to align its business operations. During periods of decreasing demand, Applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions; effectively manage its supply chain; and motivate and retain key employees. During periods of increasing demand for its products, Applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand; effectively manage its supply chain; attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees; and continue to control costs. If Applied does not accurately forecast and timely and appropriately adapt to changes in its business environment, Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.Applied is exposed to risks associated with the uncertain global economy.Uncertain global economic conditions and slowing or negative growth in China, Europe, and the United States, along with continuing difficulties in the financial markets, national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions (including a potential “fiscal cliff” in the U.S. if remedial legislation is not enacted by December 31, 2012), and government austerity measures, are posing challenges to the industries in which Applied operates. The markets for semiconductors and flat panel displays in particular depend largely on consumer spending, while the solar market depends in part on government incentives and the availability of financing for PV installations. Economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain Applied customers to push out, cancel, or refrain from placing orders for equipment or services, which may in turn reduce Applied's net sales, reduce backlog, and affect Applied’s ability to convert backlog to sales. Uncertain market conditions, difficulties in obtaining capital, or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, which can also result in lower sales and/or additional inventory or bad debt expense for Applied. These conditions may similarly affect key suppliers, which could impair their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for Applied’s products or added costs. In addition, these conditions may lead to strategic alliances by, or consolidation of, other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect Applied’s ability to compete effectively.Uncertainty about future economic and industry conditions also makes it more challenging for Applied to forecast its operating results, make business decisions, and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations. Applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, which may adversely affect Applied’s ability to capitalize on opportunities in a market recovery. In addition, Applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit, liquidity, foreign exchange, market and interest rate risks. The risks to Applied’s investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate and, as a result, the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio, as well as returns on pension assets, could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges. Applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations. If any of these financial institutions becomes insolvent, it could limit Applied’s ability to access cash in the affected accounts.18Table of ContentsIf Applied does not timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from the uncertain macroeconomic environment and industry conditions, or to difficulties in the financial markets, Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industries in which it operates.The global semiconductor, flat panel display, solar and related industries in which Applied operates are characterized by ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries, including:•the nature and timing of changes in end demand for electronic products, including those related to fluctuations in consumer buying patterns tied to seasonality or the introduction of new products, and the effects of these changes on customers’ businesses and, in turn, on demand for Applied’s products;•increasing capital requirements for building and operating new fabrication plants and customers’ ability to raise the necessary capital, particularly when financial market conditions are difficult;•differences in growth rates among the semiconductor, display and solar industries;•the increasing importance of establishing, improving and maintaining strong relationships with customers;•the increasing cost and complexity for customers to move from product design to volume manufacturing, which may slow the adoption rate of new manufacturing technology;•the need to continually reduce the total cost of manufacturing system ownership, due in part to greater demand for lower-cost consumer electronics compared to business information technology spending;•the heightened importance to customers of system reliability and productivity and the effect on demand for fabrication systems as a result of their increasing productivity, device yield and reliability;•the increasing importance of, and difficulties in, developing products with sufficient differentiation to influence customers’ purchasing decisions;•requirements for shorter cycle times for the development, manufacture and installation of manufacturing equipment;•price and performance trends for semiconductor devices, LCDs and solar PVs, and the corresponding effect on demand for such products;•the increasing importance of the availability of spare parts to maximize the time that customers’ systems are available for production;•the increasing role for and complexity of software in Applied products; and•the increasing focus on reducing energy usage and improving the environmental impact and sustainability associated with manufacturing operations.If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from the ongoing changes in the semiconductor, flat panel display, solar and related industries, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the semiconductor industry.The largest proportion of Applied’s consolidated net sales and profitability has been and continues to be derived from sales of manufacturing equipment by the Silicon Systems Group to the global semiconductor industry. In addition, a majority of the revenues of Applied Global Services is from sales of service products to semiconductor manufacturers. The semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to that industry in addition to the general industry changes described in the preceding risk factor, including:•the increasing cost of research and development due to many factors, including: decreasing linewidths on a chip, the use of new materials such as cobalt and yttrium, new and more complex device structures, more applications and process steps, increasing chip design costs, and the increasing cost and complexity of integrated manufacturing processes;•the need to reduce product development time, despite the increasing difficulty of technical challenges;•the growing number of types and varieties of semiconductors and number of applications across multiple substrate sizes;•the increasing cost and complexity for semiconductor manufacturers to move more technically advanced capability and smaller linewidths to volume manufacturing, and the resulting impact on the rates of technology transition and investment in capital equipment;•challenges in generating organic growth given semiconductor manufacturers’ decreasing capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue, and their increasing capital investment in market segments that Applied does not serve, such as lithography, or segments where Applied's products have lower relative market share;19Table of Contents•the importance of increasing market positions in under-penetrated segments, such as etch and inspection;•the growing demand for mobility products, such as tablets and smartphones, and corresponding industry investment in devices that require fewer Applied products to manufacture, such as NAND flash memory, than are needed to make  devices used in other applications, such as DRAM for personal computers; •the adoption of cloud-based memory storage particularly for mobility products, and the associated inhibiting effect on NAND bit growth rates;•the increasing frequency and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, such as 3-D transistors and advanced interconnects;•shorter cycle times between order placements by customers (particularly foundries) and product shipment, which may lead to inventory write-offs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease gross margin;•competitive factors that make it difficult to enhance market share, including challenges in securing development-tool-of-record (DTOR) and production-tool-of-record (PTOR) positions with customers;•potential shifts in sourcing strategies by a major computer and electronics company that may impact the equipment requirements of Applied's foundry customers;•the concentration of new wafer starts in Korea, where Applied’s service penetration and service-revenue-per-wafer-start have been lower than in other regions; and•the increasing fragmentation of semiconductor markets, leading certain markets to become too small to support the cost of a new fabrication plant, while others require less technologically advanced products.Applied must accurately forecast, and allocate appropriate resources and investment towards addressing, key technology changes and inflections, such as the transition to 20nm devices, in order to enable opportunities for market share gains. In addition, the proposed industry transition from 300mm to 450mm wafers presents opportunities as well as risks and uncertainties, including those related to cost, technical complexity, timing, and the resulting effect on demand for manufacturing equipment and services.  Recently, several semiconductor customers have invested in another wafer fabrication equipment supplier to help fund development of 450mm and other new technologies, which may influence the timing of technology transitions, funding allocations or other matters. If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from these and other ongoing changes occurring in the semiconductor industry, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the solar industry.Investment levels in capital equipment for the global solar industry have experienced considerable volatility. Current global solar PV production capacity exceeds anticipated near-term end-use demand, causing customers to significantly reduce or delay investments in manufacturing capacity and new technology, or to cease operations. In addition to the general industry changes described above in the third risk factor, the global solar market is characterized by ongoing changes specific to this industry that impact demand for and/or the profitability of Applied’s solar products, including:•the need to continually decrease the cost-per-watt of electricity produced by solar PV products to at or below grid parity in more global regions by, among other things, reducing operating costs and increasing throughputs for solar PV manufacturing, and improving the conversion efficiency of solar PVs;•the variability and uncertainty of government energy policies and their effect in influencing the rate of growth of the solar PV market, including the availability and amount of incentives for solar power such as tax credits, feed-in tariffs, rebates, renewable portfolio standards that require electricity providers to sell a targeted amount of energy from renewable sources, and goals for solar installations on government facilities;•the number of solar PV manufacturers and amount of global production capacity for solar PVs, primarily in China;•the filing of regulatory unfair trade proceedings against solar PVs from China, where most of Applied’s solar equipment sales are concentrated, which has resulted in the assessment of duties on solar cells and modules imported from China and led to other trade-related conflicts and outcomes;•the varying levels of operating and industry experience among solar PV manufacturers and the resulting differences in the nature and extent of customer support services requested from Applied;•challenges associated with marketing and selling manufacturing equipment and services to a diverse and diffuse customer base;•the growth of market segments in which Applied does not participate, such as passivation and furnaces;20Table of Contents•the increasing number of government-affiliated entities in China that are becoming customers;•the financial condition of solar PV customers and their access to affordable financing and capital; and•increasing solar industry challenges of solar panel manufacturing overcapacity and weaker operating performance and outlook, leading to the increasing deterioration of the solar equipment market and of the financial condition of Applied's customers.If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from the ongoing changes occurring in the solar industry, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the flat panel display industry.The global flat panel display industry historically has experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment investment levels, due in part to the limited number of LCD manufacturers, the concentrated nature of LCD end-use applications, and excess production capacity relative to end-use demand. Industry growth has depended primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced LCD TVs, which demand has slowed significantly, and more recently on demand for smartphones and other mobile devices, which demand is highly sensitive to cost and improvements in technologies and features. In addition to the general industry changes described above in the third risk factor, the display industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to that industry, including:•the timing and extent of a planned expansion of manufacturing facilities in China by Chinese display manufacturers and manufacturers from other countries, and the ability of non-Chinese manufacturers to obtain government approvals on a timely basis;•the slowing rate of transition to larger substrate sizes for LCD TVs and the resulting effect on capital intensity in the industry and on Applied’s product differentiation, gross margin and return on investment;•the increasing importance of new types of display technologies, such as low temperature polysilicon (LTPS), organic light-emitting diode (OLED) and metal oxide, and new touch panel films, such as anti-reflective and anti-fingerprint; and•uncertainty with respect to future LCD technology end-use applications and growth drivers.If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from the ongoing changes occurring in the display industry, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Applied must continually innovate, commercialize its products, and adapt its business and product offerings to respond to competition and rapid technological changes.As Applied operates in a highly competitive environment in which innovation is critical, its future success depends on many factors, including the effective commercialization and customer acceptance of its equipment, services and related products. In addition, Applied must successfully execute its growth strategy, including enhancing market share in existing markets, expanding into related markets, cultivating new markets and exceeding industry growth rates, while constantly improving its operational performance. The development, introduction and support of a broadening set of products in more collaborative, geographically diverse, open and varied competitive environments have grown increasingly complex and expensive over time. Furthermore, new or improved products may entail higher costs and reduced profits. Applied’s performance may be adversely affected if it does not timely, cost-effectively and successfully:•identify and address technology inflections, market changes, new applications, customer requirements and end-use demand;•develop new products (including disruptive technologies), improve and/or develop new applications for existing products, and adapt similar products for use by customers in different applications and/or markets with varying technical requirements;•differentiate its products from those of competitors and any disruptive technologies, meet customers’ performance specifications, appropriately price products, and achieve market acceptance;•maintain operating flexibility to enable different responses to different markets, customers and applications;•enhance its worldwide operations across all business segments to reduce cycle time, enable continuous quality improvement, reduce costs, and enhance design for manufacturability and serviceability;•focus on sales and marketing strategies that foster strong customer relationships;21Table of Contents•allocate resources, including people and R&D funding, among Applied’s products and between the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products, as most appropriate and effective for future growth;•reduce the cost and improve the productivity of capital invested in R&D activities;•accurately forecast demand, work with suppliers and meet production schedules for its products;•improve its manufacturing processes and achieve cost efficiencies across product offerings;•adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different parts of the supply chain;•qualify products for evaluation and, in turn, volume manufacturing with its customers; and•implement changes in its design engineering methodology, including those that enable reduction of material costs and cycle time, greater commonality of platforms and types of parts used in different systems, greater effectiveness of product life cycle management, and reduced energy usage and environmental impact.If Applied does not successfully manage these challenges, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base.Applied’s semiconductor customer base historically has been, and is becoming even more, highly concentrated as a result of economic and industry conditions. In fiscal 2012, three semiconductor manufacturers accounted for 60 percent of Silicon Systems Group net sales and two customers accounted for 36 percent of Applied’s consolidated net sales. Applied’s display customer base is also highly concentrated, while concentration within Applied’s solar customer base varies depending on the product line but is increasing due to challenging industry conditions. Applied’s customer base is also geographically-concentrated. In fiscal 2012, customers in Taiwan accounted for 32 percent of net sales for the Silicon Systems Group segment, while customers in Korea and the U.S. together constituted 49 percent; customers in Taiwan and China accounted for a total of 66 percent of net sales for the Display segment; and customers in China accounted for 49 percent of net sales for the Energy and Environmental Solutions segment.In addition, certain customers have experienced significant ownership or management changes, consolidated with other manufacturers, outsourced manufacturing activities, or engaged in collaboration or cooperation arrangements with other manufacturers. Customers have entered into strategic alliances or industry consortia that have increased the influence of key industry participants in technology decisions made by their partners. Also, certain customers are making an increasingly greater percentage of their respective industry’s capital equipment investments. Further, claims or litigation involving key industry participants may result in changes in sourcing strategies and other outcomes. In this environment, contracts or orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers have accounted for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of Applied’s business, which may result in added complexities in managing customer relationships and transactions and make it more challenging for Applied’s business units to generate organic growth. In addition, the mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. If customers do not place orders, or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel orders, Applied may not be able to replace the business. As Applied’s products are configured to customer specifications, changing, rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant, non-recoverable costs. Major customers may also seek, and on occasion receive, pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to Applied. These factors could have a material adverse effect on Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business.In fiscal 2012, approximately 80 percent of Applied’s net sales were to customers in regions outside the United States. Moreover, China now represents the largest market for various electronic products, such as TVs, PCs, and smartphones. Certain of Applied’s R&D and manufacturing facilities, as well as suppliers to Applied, are also located outside the United States, including in Singapore, Taiwan, China, Korea, Israel, Germany, Italy and Switzerland. Applied is also expanding its business and operations in new countries. The global nature of Applied’s business and operations, combined with the need to continually improve the Company’s operating cost structure, presents challenges, including but not limited to those arising from:•varying regional and geopolitical business conditions and demands;•political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations and policies within countries that favor domestic companies over non-domestic companies, including customer- or government-supported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors;•customer- or government-supported efforts to influence Applied to conduct more of its operations in a particular country, such as Korea and China;•variations among, and changes in, local, regional, national or international laws and regulations (including intellectual 22Table of Contentsproperty, labor, tax, and import/export laws), as well as the interpretation and application of such laws and regulations;•global trade issues, including those related to the interpretation and application of import and export licenses, as well as international trade disputes;•positions taken by governmental agencies regarding possible national commercial and/or security issues posed by international business operations;•fluctuating raw material, commodity, energy and shipping costs or shipping delays;•challenges associated with managing more geographically diverse operations and projects, which require an effective organizational structure and appropriate business processes, procedures and controls;•a more diverse workforce with different experience levels, cultures, customs, business practices and worker expectations;•variations in the ability to develop relationships with local customers, suppliers and governments;•fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates, including the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, euro, Taiwanese dollar, Israeli shekel or Chinese yuan;•the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations around the world;•political instability, natural disasters (such as earthquakes, floods or storms), pandemics, social unrest, terrorism or acts of war in locations where Applied has operations, suppliers or sales, or that may influence the value chain of the industries that Applied serves;•the need for an effective business continuity plan if a disaster or other event occurs that could disrupt business operations;•reliance on various information systems, data centers and software applications to conduct many aspects of Applied's business, which may be vulnerable to cyberattacks by third parties or breached due to employee error, misuse or other causes that could result in business disruptions, misappropriation of confidential information, or other adverse consequences in the event that Applied’s firewalls and security processes and practices are ineffective;•the need to regularly reassess the size, capability and location of global infrastructure and make appropriate changes;•cultural and language differences;•difficulties and uncertainties associated with the entry into new countries;•hiring and integration of an increasing number of new workers, including in countries such as India and China;•the increasing need for the workforce to be more mobile and work in or travel to different regions;•uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various countries; and•uncertainties with respect to growth rates for the manufacture and sale of semiconductors, LCDs and solar PVs in the developing economies of certain countries.Many of these challenges are present in China and Korea, which are experiencing significant growth of customers, suppliers and competitors to Applied. Applied further believes that China and Korea present large potential markets for its products and opportunity for growth over the long term, although at lower projected levels of profitability and margins for certain products than historically have been achieved in other regions. These challenges may materially and adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Operating in multiple industries, and the entry into new markets and industries, entail additional challenges and obligations.As part of its growth strategy, Applied must successfully expand into related or new markets and industries, either with its existing products or with new products developed internally or obtained through acquisitions. The entry into different markets involves additional challenges, including those arising from:•the need to devote additional resources to develop new products for, and operate in, new markets;•the need to develop new sales and technical marketing strategies, cultivate relationships with new customers and meet different customer service requirements;•differing rates of profitability and growth among multiple businesses;•Applied’s ability to anticipate demand, capitalize on opportunities, and avoid or minimize risks;•the complexity of managing multiple businesses with variations in production planning, execution, supply chain management and logistics;•the adoption of new business models, business processes and systems;23Table of Contents•Applied’s ability to rapidly expand or reduce its operations to meet increased or decreased demand, respectively, and the associated effect on working capital;•new materials, processes and technologies;•the need to attract, motivate and retain employees with skills and expertise in these new areas;•new and more diverse customers and suppliers, including some with limited operating histories, uncertain and/or limited funding, evolving business models and/or locations in regions where Applied does not have, or has limited, operations;•new or different competitors with potentially more financial or other resources, industry experience and/or established customer relationships;•entry into new industries and countries, with differing levels of government involvement, laws and regulations, and business, employment and safety practices;•third parties’ intellectual property rights; and•the need to comply with, or work to establish, industry standards and practices.In addition, Applied from time to time receives funding from United States and other government agencies for certain strategic development programs to increase its research and development resources and address new market opportunities. As a condition to this government funding, Applied may be subject to certain record-keeping, audit, intellectual property rights-sharing and/or other obligations.If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from its diversification and entry into new markets and industries, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect Applied’s ability to meet customer demand and lead to higher costs, while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory.Applied’s business depends on its timely supply of equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of its customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts, components and subassemblies (collectively, parts) from suppliers, including contract manufacturers. Some key parts are subject to long lead-times and/or obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the countries where Applied conducts its manufacturing, including China and Korea. Cyclical industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for Applied and for companies throughout its supply chain. Further, the adverse conditions in the credit and financial markets and industry slowdowns have caused, and may continue to cause, some suppliers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other companies, or file for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations. Applied may also experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations, delays in its ability to deliver products or services, increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of:•the failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective basis;•volatility in the availability and cost of materials, including rare earth elements;•difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals;•information technology or infrastructure failures; and•natural disasters or other events beyond Applied's control (such as earthquakes, floods or storms, regional economic downturns, pandemics, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war), particularly where it conducts manufacturing (such as Israel, which has recently experienced increased geopolitical conflict).If a supplier fails to meet Applied’s requirements concerning quality, cost, socially-responsible business practices, or other performance factors, Applied may transfer its business to alternative sources, which could entail manufacturing delays, additional costs, or other difficulties. In addition, if Applied needs to rapidly increase its business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules, this may exacerbate any interruptions in Applied’s manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on Applied’s working capital. Moreover, if actual demand for Applied’s products is different than expected, Applied may purchase more/fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery of parts. If Applied purchases inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize, or if customers reduce or delay orders, Applied may incur excess inventory charges. Any or all of these factors could materially and adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations.24Table of ContentsThe ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital to Applied’s success.Applied’s success, competitiveness and ability to execute on its global strategies and maintain a culture of innovation depend in large part on its ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees, especially in critical positions. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, management changes, Applied’s organizational structure, competitors’ hiring practices, cost reduction activities (including workforce reductions and unpaid shutdowns), availability of career development opportunities, the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries, and the effectiveness of Applied’s compensation and benefit programs, including its share-based programs. Restructuring programs present particular challenges to the extent they involve the departure of knowledgeable and experienced employees and the resulting need to identify and train existing or new workers to perform necessary functions, which may result in unexpected costs, reduced productivity, and/or difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls.  If Applied does not successfully attract, retain and motivate key employees with appropriate skills, Applied may be unable to capitalize on its opportunities and its business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.Applied is exposed to risks associated with acquisitions and strategic investments.Applied has made, and in the future intends to make, acquisitions of or investments in companies, technologies or products in existing, related or new markets for Applied. In November 2011, Applied completed its acquisition of Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. (Varian), which was the Company’s largest acquisition to date. Acquisitions involve numerous risks that vary depending on the scale and nature of the acquisition, including but not limited to:•diversion of management’s attention from other operational matters;•inability to complete acquisitions as anticipated or at all;•the appropriateness of valuation and other transaction terms;•requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures and/or restrictions on the conduct of Applied’s existing business or the acquired business;•ineffective integration of operations, systems, technologies, products or employees of an acquired business, which can impact the ability to realize anticipated synergies or other benefits;•failure to commercialize purchased technologies;•initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;•inability to capitalize on characteristics of new markets that may be significantly different from Applied’s existing markets and where competitors may have stronger market positions and customer relationships;•failure to attract, retain and motivate key employees from the acquired business;•reductions in cash balances and/or increases in debt obligations to finance the acquisition, which reduce the availability of cash flow for general corporate or other purposes;•exposure to new operational risks, rules, regulations, worker expectations, customs and practices to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where Applied has not historically conducted business;•challenges associated with managing new, more diverse and more widespread operations, projects and people;•inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key technologies;•inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company’s internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and/or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices;•impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the segment;25Table of Contents•the risk of litigation or claims associated with a proposed or completed transaction;•unknown, underestimated and/or undisclosed commitments or liabilities; and•the inappropriate scale of acquired entities’ critical resources or facilities for business needs.Applied also makes strategic investments in other companies, including companies formed as joint ventures, which may decline in value and/or not meet desired objectives. The success of these investments depends on various factors over which Applied may have limited or no control and, particularly with respect to joint ventures, requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic partners. The risks to Applied’s strategic investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and, as a result, the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges. Mergers and acquisitions and strategic investments are inherently subject to significant risks. If Applied does not successfully manage the risks associated with acquisitions and strategic investments, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Applied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims and protection of intellectual property rights.Applied from time to time is, and in the future may be, involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement, intellectual property rights, antitrust, environmental regulations, securities, contracts, product performance, product liability, unfair competition, misappropriation of trade secrets, employment, workplace safety, and other matters. Applied also on occasion receives notification from customers who believe that Applied owes them indemnification or other obligations related to claims made against such customers by third parties.In February 2010, the Seoul Prosecutor’s Office for the Eastern District in Korea indicted certain employees of Applied Materials Korea (AMK), including the former head of AMK who at the time of indictment was a vice president of Applied Materials, Inc., along with employees of several other companies, alleging the improper receipt and use of confidential information of Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (Samsung), a major customer. Hearings on these matters have been ongoing. On November 22, 2012, the Court held the last hearing and scheduled the announcement of its decision for January 24, 2013.Legal proceedings and claims, whether with or without merit, and associated internal investigations, may (1) be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct; (2) divert management’s attention and other Applied resources; (3) inhibit Applied’s ability to sell its products; (4) result in adverse judgments for damages, injunctive relief, penalties and fines; and/or (5) negatively affect Applied’s business. There can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings, claims or investigations. If Applied is not able to favorably resolve or settle legal proceedings or claims, or in the event of any adverse findings against Applied or any of its employees, Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and Applied may suffer harm to its reputation.In addition, Applied’s success depends in significant part on the protection of its intellectual property and other rights. Infringement of Applied’s rights by a third party, such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts, could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for Applied. Applied’s intellectual property rights may not provide significant competitive advantages if they are circumvented, invalidated, rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, or if Applied does not adequately protect or assert these rights. Furthermore, the laws and practices of other countries, including China, India, Taiwan and Korea, permit the protection and enforcement of Applied’s rights to varying extents, which may not be sufficient to adequately protect Applied’s rights. Applied previously entered into an arrangement with one of its competitors to decrease the risk of patent infringement lawsuits in the future. There can be no assurance that the intended results of this arrangement will be achieved or that Applied will be able to adequately protect its intellectual property rights with the restrictions associated with the arrangement. If Applied is not able to favorably resolve or settle claims, obtain or enforce intellectual property rights, obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, and/or successfully prosecute or defend its intellectual property position, Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and Applied may suffer harm to its reputation.26Table of ContentsThe failure to successfully implement and conduct outsourcing activities and other operational initiatives could adversely affect results of operations.To better align its costs with market conditions, locate closer to customers, enhance productivity, and improve efficiencies, Applied conducts certain engineering, software development, manufacturing, sourcing and other operations in regions outside the United States, including India, Taiwan, China, and Korea. Applied has implemented a distributed manufacturing model, under which certain manufacturing and supply chain activities are conducted in various countries, including the United States, Europe, Israel, Singapore, Taiwan and other countries in Asia, and assembly of some systems is completed at customer sites. In addition, Applied outsources certain functions to third parties, including companies in the United States, India, China, Korea, Malaysia and other countries. Outsourced functions include contract manufacturing, engineering, customer support, software development, information technology support, finance and administrative activities. The expanding role of third party providers has required changes to Applied’s existing operations and the adoption of new procedures and processes for retaining and managing these providers, as well as redistributing responsibilities as warranted, in order to realize the potential productivity and operational efficiencies, assure quality and continuity of supply, and protect the intellectual property of Applied and its customers, suppliers and other partners. If Applied does not accurately forecast the amount, timing and mix of demand for products, or if contract manufacturers or other outsource providers fail to perform in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, Applied’s ability to meet customer requirements could suffer, particularly during a market upturn.In addition, Applied must regularly implement or update comprehensive programs and processes to better align its global organizations, including initiatives to enhance the Asia supply chain and improve back office and information technology infrastructure for more efficient transaction processing. Applied also is implementing a multi-year, company-wide program to transform certain business processes or extend established processes, including the transition to a single enterprise resource planning (ERP) software system to perform various functions. The implementation of additional functionality to the ERP system entails certain risks, including difficulties with changes in business processes that could disrupt Applied’s operations, such as its ability to track orders and timely ship products, project inventory requirements, manage its supply chain and aggregate financial and operational data. During transitions Applied must continue to rely on legacy information systems, which may be costly or inefficient, while the implementation of new initiatives may not achieve the anticipated benefits and may divert management’s attention from other operational activities, negatively affect employee morale, or have other unintended consequences.If Applied does not effectively develop and implement its outsourcing and relocation strategies, if required export and other governmental approvals are not timely obtained, if Applied’s third party providers do not perform as anticipated, or if there are delays or difficulties in enhancing business processes, Applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies, and may experience operational difficulties, increased costs (including energy and transportation), manufacturing interruptions or delays, inefficiencies in the structure and/or operation of its supply chain, loss of its intellectual property rights, quality issues, reputational harm, increased product time-to-market, and/or inefficient allocation of human resources, any or all of which could materially and adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Applied may incur impairment charges to goodwill or long-lived assets.Applied has a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions. Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The review compares the fair value for each of Applied’s reporting units to its associated carrying value, including goodwill. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, declines in the market price of Applied common stock, changes in Applied’s strategies or product portfolio, and restructuring activities. Applied’s valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, Applied concluded that the carrying value of the Energy and Environmental Solutions reporting unit exceeded its fair value and accordingly recorded a $421 million goodwill impairment charge. Applied may be required to record future charges to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined to exist, which could materially and adversely affect Applied’s results of operations.27Table of ContentsChanges in tax rates or tax assets and liabilities could affect results of operations.As a global company, Applied is subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. Applied’s future annual and quarterly tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the: (1) applicable tax laws; (2) amount and composition of pre-tax income in countries with differing tax rates; (3) plans of the Company to permanently reinvest certain funds held outside of the U.S.; or (4) valuation of Applied’s deferred tax assets and liabilities.To better align with the increasingly international nature of its business, Applied is transitioning certain manufacturing, supply chain, and other operations into Asia, bringing these activities closer to customers. These changes are expected to result in a reduction of future operating costs. Applied has received authorization to use tax incentives that provide that income earned in certain countries outside the U.S. will be subject to tax holidays or reduced income tax rates. To obtain the benefit of these tax provisions, Applied must meet requirements relating to various activities. Applied’s ability to realize benefits from these provisions could be materially affected if, among other things, applicable requirements are not met, or if Applied incurs net losses for which it cannot claim a deduction.In addition, Applied is subject to regular examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and from time to time initiates amendments to previously filed tax returns. Applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes, which requires estimates and judgments. Although Applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will agree with such estimates. Applied may have to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the estimates, which may be time-consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that Applied will be successful or that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in Applied’s historical income tax provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect Applied’s financial condition and results of operations.Applied is subject to risks of non-compliance with environmental and safety regulations.Applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in connection with its global business operations, including but not limited to: regulations related to the development, manufacture and use of its products; recycling and disposal of materials used in its products or in producing its products; the operation of its facilities; and the use of its real property. The failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and safety regulations, such as those related to climate change, could result in: (1) significant remediation liabilities; (2) the imposition of fines; (3) the suspension or termination of the development, manufacture, sale or use of certain of its products; (4) limitations on the operation of its facilities or ability to use its real property; and/or (5) a decrease in the value of its real property, each of which could have a material adverse effect on Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Applied is exposed to various risks related to the regulatory environment.Applied is subject to various risks related to: (1) new, different, inconsistent or even conflicting laws, rules and regulations that may be enacted by executive order, legislative bodies and/or regulatory agencies in the countries in which Applied operates; (2) disagreements or disputes between national or regional regulatory agencies related to international trade; and (3) the interpretation and application of laws, rules and regulations. For example, as a public company with global operations, Applied is subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, including those related to financial and other disclosures, corporate governance, privacy, and anti-corruption. Changes in laws, regulations and standards may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters. Efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If Applied is found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance with applicable laws, rules or regulations, Applied could be subject to legal or regulatory sanctions, the public’s and customers’ perception of Applied could decline, and Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. "
6,AMAT,APPLIED MATERIALS INC,2011-12-06,">Item 1A:Risk Factors
 The following factors could materially affect Applieds business, financial condition or results of operations and should becarefully considered in evaluating the Company and its business, in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report.  The industries that Applied serves are volatile and difficult to predict.  As a supplier to the global semiconductor, flat panel display, solar and related industries, Applied is subject to business cycles, the timing, length and volatility of which can be difficult to predictand which vary by reportable segment. These industries historically have been cyclical due to sudden changes in customers manufacturing capacity and advanced technology requirements and spending, which depend in part on customerscapacity utilization, production volumes, access to affordable capital, end-use demand, and inventory levels relative to demand, as well as the rate of technology transitions. These changes have affected the timing and amounts of customerspurchases and investments in technology, and continue to affect Applieds orders, net sales, operating expenses and net income.  To meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves, Applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity for each of its segments as well as acrossmultiple segments. During periods of decreasing demand, Applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions; effectively manage its supply chain; and motivate and retain key employees. During periods ofincreasing demand for its products, Applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand; effectively manage its supply chain; attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees; and continueto control costs. If Applied does not accurately forecast and timely and appropriately adapt to changes in its business environment, Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.  19 Table of ContentsApplied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industriesin which it operates.  The global semiconductor, flat panel display, solar and related industries in which Appliedoperates are characterized by ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries, including:      increasing capital requirements for building and operating new fabrication plants and customers ability to raise the necessary capital,particularly when financial market conditions are difficult;      differences in growth rates among the semiconductor, display and solar industries;     the increasing importance of establishing, improving and maintaining strong relationships with customers;     changes in end demand for electronic products over time and the effect of these changes on customers businesses and, in turn, on demand forApplieds products;      abrupt and unforeseen shifts in the nature and amount of customer and end-user demand;     the increasing cost and complexity for customers to move from product design to volume manufacturing, which may slow the adoption rate of newmanufacturing technology;      the need to continually reduce the total cost of manufacturing system ownership, due in part to greater demand for lower-cost consumer electronicscompared to business information technology spending;      the heightened importance to customers of system reliability and productivity and the effect on demand for fabrication systems as a result of theirincreasing productivity, device yield and reliability;      the increasing importance of, and difficulties in, developing products with sufficient differentiation to influence customers purchasingdecisions;      requirements for shorter cycle times for the development, manufacture and installation of manufacturing equipment;     price and performance trends for semiconductor devices, LCDs and solar PVs, and the corresponding effect on demand for such products;     the increasing importance of the availability of spare parts to maximize the time that customers systems are available for production;     the increasing role for and complexity of software in Applied products; and     the increasing focus on reducing energy usage and improving the environmental impact and sustainability associated with manufacturing operations. If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from the ongoing changes in the semiconductor,flat panel display, solar and related industries, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.  Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the semiconductor industry.  The greatest portion of Applieds consolidated net sales and profitability historically has been derived from sales of manufacturing equipment by the Silicon Systems Group to the global semiconductorindustry. In addition, a majority of the revenues of Applied Global Services is from sales of service products to semiconductor manufacturers. The semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to that industry in addition tothe general industry changes described in the preceding risk factor, including:      the increasing cost of research and development due to many factors, including: decreasing linewidths on a chip; the use of new materials such ascobalt and yttrium; new and more complex device structures; more applications and process steps; increasing chip design costs; and the increasing cost and complexity of integrated manufacturing processes;   20 Table of Contents   the cost, technical complexity and timing of a proposed industry transition from 300mm to 450mm wafers, and the resulting effect on demand formanufacturing equipment and services;      the need to reduce product development time, despite the increasing difficulty of technical challenges;     the growing number of types and varieties of semiconductors and number of applications across multiple substrate sizes;     changes in demand and differing market growth rates for (i) different electronic products, such as tablets, smartphones, and personal computers,and in turn (ii) different applications/devices, such as NAND Flash, DRAM, logic, foundry and MRAM, and the resulting effect on customers capital spending patterns and on Applieds ability to compete in these market segments;     the increasing cost and complexity for semiconductor manufacturers to move more technically advanced capability and smaller linewidths to volumemanufacturing, and the resulting impact on the rates of technology transition and investment in capital equipment;      challenges associated with generating organic growth in light of semiconductor manufacturers decreasing rate of capital expenditures as apercentage of revenue, and manufacturers increasing allocation of capital investment to markets that Applied does not serve, such as lithography;     the increasing frequency and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, such as ALD, 3-D transistors, advanced interconnect, wafer-levelpackaging, and extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV);      shorter cycle times between customers order placement and product shipment, which may lead to inventory write-offs and manufacturinginefficiencies that decrease gross margin;      technology developments in related markets, such as lithography, to which Applied may need to adapt;     competitive factors that make it difficult to enhance market position;     the importance of increasing market positions in larger market segments, such as etch and inspection;     the increasing concentration of wafer starts in one country, Korea, where Applieds service penetration and service-revenue-per-wafer-start havebeen lower than in other regions; and      the increasing fragmentation of semiconductor markets, leading certain markets to become too small to support the cost of a new fabrication plant,while others require less technologically advanced products.  If Applied does not successfully manage therisks resulting from the ongoing changes occurring in the semiconductor industry, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the flat panel display industry. The global flat panel display industry historically has experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment investment levels, due inpart to the limited number of LCD manufacturers and the concentrated nature of LCD end-use applications. Recently, industry growth has depended to a considerable extent on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced TVs, as well assmartphones and other mobile devices, which demand is highly sensitive to cost and improvements in technologies and features. In addition to the general industry changes described above in the second risk factor, the display industry ischaracterized by ongoing changes particular to that industry, including:      the planned expansion of manufacturing facilities in China by Chinese display manufacturers and manufacturers from other countries, and the ability ofnon-Chinese manufacturers to obtain government approvals on a timely basis;      the slowing rate of transition to larger substrate sizes for LCDs and the resulting effect on capital intensity in the industry and on Appliedsproduct differentiation, gross margin and return on investment;   21 Table of Contents   the increasing importance of new types of displays, such as low temperature polysilicon (LTPS) and OLEDs, and new touch panel films, such asanti-reflective and anti-fingerprint;      the likelihood and timing of a transition to a new CVD backplane technology, metal oxide; and     uncertainty with respect to future LCD technology end-use applications and growth drivers. If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from the ongoing changes occurring in the display industry, its business,financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.  Applied is exposed to risksas a result of ongoing changes specific to the solar industry.  An increasing portion of Applieds business is inthe emerging solar market, which, in addition to the general industry changes described above in the second risk factor, is characterized by ongoing changes specific to the solar industry, including:     the need to continually decrease the cost-per-watt of electricity produced by solar PV products to at or below grid parity by, among other things,reducing operating costs and increasing throughputs for solar PV manufacturing, and improving the conversion efficiency of solar PVs;      the impact on demand for solar PV products arising from the cost of electricity generated by solar PVs compared to the cost of electricity from theexisting grid or other energy sources;      the varying energy policies of governments around the world and their effect in influencing the rate of growth of the solar PV market, including theavailability and amount of government incentives for solar power such as tax credits, feed-in tariffs, rebates, renewable portfolio standards that require electricity providers to sell a targeted amount of energy from renewable sources, and goalsfor solar installations on government facilities;      the growing number of solar PV manufacturers and increasing global production capacity for solar PVs, primarily in China;     the filing by U.S. solar manufacturers of a regulatory unfair trade action against solar PVs from China, where most of Applieds solar equipmentsales are concentrated, which could result in the U.S. governments assessment of duties on solar cells and modules imported from China or other outcomes and, in turn, adversely impact demand for Applieds products;     the varying levels of operating and industry experience among solar PV manufacturers and the resulting differences in the nature and extent of customersupport services requested from Applied;      challenges associated with marketing and selling manufacturing equipment and services to a diverse and diffuse customer base;     the growth of market segments in which Applied does not participate, such as passivation and furnaces;     the increasing number of government-affiliated entities in China that are becoming customers;     the cost of polysilicon and other materials; and      access to affordable financing and capital by customers and end-users. In addition, current projections for global solar PV production exceed anticipated near-term, end-use demand, which is heavily dependenton installed cost-per-watt, government policies and incentives, and the availability of affordable capital. An oversupply of solar PVs that leads customers to delay or reduce investments in manufacturing capacity and new technology adversely impactsthe sales growth rates and/or profitability of Applieds products. If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from the ongoing changes occurring in the solar industry, its business, financial condition and results of operationscould be materially and adversely affected.   22 Table of ContentsApplied is exposed to risks associated with the difficult financial markets anduncertain global economy.  Continuing difficulties in the financial markets, national debt concerns in various regions,and uncertainty regarding the global economy are posing challenges, and some governments may implement policies to control economic growth. The markets for semiconductors and flat panel displays in particular depend largely on consumer spending,while the solar market depends in part on government incentives and the availability of financing for PV installations. Economic uncertainty and related factors, including unemployment, inflation and fuel prices, exacerbate negative trends inbusiness and consumer spending and may cause certain Applied customers to push out, cancel, or refrain from placing orders for equipment or services, which may reduce net sales, reduce backlog, and affect Applieds ability to convert backlog tosales. Difficulties in obtaining capital, uncertain market conditions, or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection andpotentially cease operations, leading to customers reducing research and development funding and/or capital expenditures and, in turn, lower sales and/or additional inventory or bad debt expense for Applied. These conditions may also similarlyaffect key suppliers, which could impair their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for Applieds products or added costs. In addition, these conditions may lead to strategic alliances by, or consolidation of, other equipmentmanufacturers, which could adversely affect Applieds ability to compete effectively.  Uncertainty about future economicand industry conditions also makes it more challenging for Applied to forecast its operating results, make business decisions, and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its business, sources and uses of cash, financial condition andresults of operations. Applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, and/or modify its business model, which may adversely affect Applieds ability to capitalize on opportunities ina market recovery.  In addition, Applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit, liquidity,foreign exchange, market and interest rate risks. The risks to Applieds investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate and, as a result, the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio, as well asreturns on pension assets, could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges. Applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations. If one or more of these financial institutionsbecome insolvent or are taken over by a government, it could limit Applieds ability to access cash in the affected accounts.  If Applied does not timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from the uncertain macroeconomic environment and industry conditions, or to difficulties in the financial markets. Appliedsbusiness, financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.  Applied mustcontinually innovate and adapt its business and product offerings to respond to competition and rapid technological changes.  As Applied operates in a highly competitive environment in which innovation is critical, its future success depends on many factors, including the effective commercialization and customer acceptance ofits equipment, services and related products. In addition, Applied must successfully execute its growth strategy, including enhancing market share in existing markets, expanding into related markets, cultivating new markets and exceeding industrygrowth rates, while constantly improving its operational performance. The development, introduction and support of a broadening set of products in more collaborative, geographically diverse, open and varied competitive environments have grownincreasingly complex and expensive over time. Furthermore, new or improved products may entail higher costs and reduced profits. Applieds performance may be adversely affected if it does not timely, cost-effectively and successfully:     identify and address technology inflections, market changes, new applications, customer requirements and end-use demand;     develop new products (including disruptive technologies), improve and/or develop new applications for existing products, and adapt similar products foruse by customers in different applications and/or markets with varying technical requirements;      appropriately price and achieve market acceptance of its products;   23 Table of Contents   differentiate its products from those of competitors and any disruptive technologies, and meet customers performance specifications;     maintain operating flexibility to enable different responses to different markets, customers and applications;     enhance its worldwide operations across all business segments to reduce cycle time, enable continuous quality improvement, reduce costs, and enhancedesign for manufacturability and design for serviceability;      focus on sales and marketing strategies that foster strong customer relationships;     allocate resources, including people and R&D funding, among Applieds products and between the development of new products and the enhancementof existing products, as most appropriate and effective for future growth;      reduce the cost, and improve the productivity of capital invested in R&D activities;     accurately forecast demand, work with suppliers and meet production schedules for its products;     improve its manufacturing processes and achieve cost efficiencies across product offerings;     adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different parts of the supply chain;     qualify products for evaluation and, in turn, volume manufacturing with its customers; and     implement changes in its design engineering methodology, including those that enable reduction of material costs and cycle time, greater commonality ofplatforms and types of parts used in different systems, greater effectiveness of product life cycle management, and reduced energy usage and environmental impact. If Applied does not successfully manage these challenges, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materiallyand adversely affected.  Operating in multiple industries, and the entry into new markets and industries, entailadditional challenges and obligations.  As part of its growth strategy, Applied must successfully expand into relatedor new markets and industries, either with its existing products or with new products developed internally or obtained through acquisitions. The entry into different markets involves additional challenges, including those arising from:     the need to devote additional resources to develop new products for, and operate in, new markets;     the need to develop new sales and marketing strategies and cultivate relationships with new customers;     differing rates of profitability and growth among multiple businesses;     Applieds ability to anticipate demand, capitalize on opportunities, and avoid or minimize risks;     the complexity of managing multiple businesses with variations in production planning, execution, supply chain management and logistics;     the adoption of new business models;      the need to undertake activities to grow demand for end-products;     the need to develop and successfully implement adequate new business processes and systems;     Applieds ability to rapidly expand its operations to meet increased demand and the associated effect on working capital;     new materials, processes and technologies;      the need to attract, motivate and retain employees with skills and expertise in these new areas;   24 Table of Contents   new and more diverse customers and suppliers, including some with limited operating histories, uncertain and/or limited funding, evolving businessmodels and/or locations in regions where Applied does not have, or has limited, operations;      different customer service requirements;      new or different competitors with potentially more financial or other resources, industry experience and/or established customer relationships;     entry into new industries and countries, with differing levels of government involvement, laws and regulations, and business, employment and safetypractices;      third parties intellectual property rights; and     the need to comply with, or work to establish, industry standards and practices. In addition, Applied has begun applying for and receiving funding from United States and other government agencies for certain strategicdevelopment programs to increase its R&D resources and address new market opportunities. As a condition to this government funding, Applied may be subject to certain record-keeping, audit, intellectual property rights-sharing and/or otherobligations.  If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from its diversification and entry into new marketsand industries, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business. In fiscal 2011, approximately 81 percent of Applieds net sales were to customers in regions outside the United States. Certain ofApplieds R&D and manufacturing facilities, as well as suppliers to Applied, are also located outside the United States, including in Singapore, Taiwan, China, Korea, Israel, Germany, Italy and Switzerland. Applied is also expanding itsbusiness and operations in new countries. The global nature of Applieds business and operations presents challenges, including but not limited to those arising from:     varying regional and geopolitical business conditions and demands;     political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations and policies within countries that favor domestic companies over non-domestic companies,including customer- or government-supported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors;      customer- or government-supported efforts to influence Applied to conduct more of its operations in a particular country, such as Korea and China;     variations among, and changes in, local, regional, national or international laws and regulations (including intellectual property, labor, tax, andimport /export laws), as well as the interpretation and application of such laws and regulations;      global trade issues, including those related to the interpretation and application of import and export licenses, as well as international tradedisputes;      positions taken by governmental agencies regarding possible national commercial and/or security issues posed by international business operations;     fluctuating raw material, commodity and energy costs;     challenges associated with managing more geographically diverse operations and projects, which requires an effective organizational structure andappropriate business processes, procedures and controls;      a more diverse workforce with different cultures, customs, business practices and worker expectations;     variations in the ability to develop relationships with local customers, suppliers and governments;     fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates, including the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar against the Japaneseyen, euro, Taiwanese dollar, Israeli shekel or Chinese yuan;   25 Table of Contents   the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations around the world;     political instability, natural disasters (such as earthquakes, floods or storms), pandemics, social unrest, terrorism or acts of war in locations whereApplied has operations, suppliers or sales, or that may influence the value chain of the industries that Applied serves;      reliance on various information systems, data centers and software applications to conduct many aspects of the Companys business, which may bevulnerable to cyberattacks by third parties or breached due to employee error, misuse or other causes that could result in business disruptions, loss of confidential information, or other adverse consequences in the event that Appliedsfirewalls and security processes and practices are ineffective;      the need for an effective business continuity plan if a disaster or other event occurs that could disrupt business operations;     the need to regularly reassess the size, capability and location of the Companys global infrastructure and make appropriate changes;     cultural and language differences;      shipping costs and/or delays;      the need to continually improve the Companys operating cost structure;     difficulties and uncertainties associated with the entry into new countries;     hiring and integration of an increasing percentage of new workers, including in countries such as India and China;     the increasing need for the workforce to be more mobile and work in or travel to different regions;     uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various countries; and     uncertainties with respect to growth rates for the manufacture and sales of semiconductors, LCDs and solar PVs in the developing economies of certaincountries.  Many of these challenges are present in China and Korea, which are experiencing significantgrowth of customers, suppliers and competitors to Applied. Applied further believes that China and Korea present large potential markets for its products and opportunity for growth over the long term, although at lower projected levels ofprofitability and margins for certain products than historically have been achieved in other regions. These challenges may materially and adversely affect Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in March 2011, Japan experienced a significant earthquake, aftershocks, and tsunami that resulted in widespread damage andbusiness interruptions throughout the country, including those associated with radiation concerns arising from damage to a nuclear power plant. Certain of Applieds customers and suppliers are located in Japan and Applied also has sales andservice centers in the country. While Applied has not experienced any material impact on its business or operations to date and has taken actions to enhance its ability to meet customers requirements, Applied cannot predict the extent of theimpact the situation in Japan may have, if any, on its future business and operations.  Applied is exposed to risksassociated with a highly concentrated customer base.  Applieds semiconductor and flat panel display customerbases historically have been, and are becoming even more, highly concentrated as a result of economic and industry conditions. For example, in fiscal 2011, three semiconductor manufacturers accounted for 52 percent of Silicon Systems Group netsales, and three LCD manufacturers accounted for 54 percent of Display net sales. Further, three customers accounted for 32 percent of Applieds consolidated net sales in fiscal 2011. Certain customers have experienced significant ownership ormanagement changes, consolidated with other manufacturers, outsourced manufacturing activities, or engaged in   26 Table of Contentscollaboration or cooperation arrangements with other manufacturers. In addition, customers have entered into strategic alliances or industry consortia that have increased the influence of keyindustry participants in technology decisions made by their partners. Also, certain semiconductor and display customers are making an increasingly greater percentage of their respective industrys capital equipment investments. Customerconcentration within Applieds solar customer base varies depending on the product line. For precision wafering systems, five solar manufacturers accounted for 57 percent of net sales in fiscal 2011, while the Baccini cell systems business hasa more diffuse customer base. Applieds customer base in each of the Display and Energy and Environmental Solutions segments is also geographically-concentrated. In fiscal 2011, customers in China and Taiwan accounted for a total of 78 percentof net sales for the Display segment, while customers in China accounted for 80 percent of net sales for the Energy and Environmental Solutions segment.  In this environment, contracts or orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers have accounted for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of Appliedsbusiness, which may result in added complexities in managing customer relationships and transactions and make it more challenging for Applieds business units to generate organic growth. In addition, the mix and type of customers, and sales toany single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. If customers do not place orders, or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel orders, Applied may not be able to replace the business. As Appliedsproducts are configured to customer specifications, changing, rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant, non-recoverable costs. Major customers may also seek, and on occasion receive, pricing, payment, intellectual property-related,or other commercial terms that are less favorable to Applied. These factors could have a material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations. Manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect Applieds ability to meet customer demand and lead to higher costs, whilethe failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory.  Appliedsbusiness depends on its timely supply of equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of its customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts, components and subassemblies(collectively, parts) from suppliers, including contract manufacturers. Some key parts are subject to long lead-times and/or obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided bysuppliers located in countries other than the countries where Applied conducts its manufacturing, including China and Korea. Cyclical industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital, technical,operational and other risks for companies throughout Applieds supply chain. Further, the adverse conditions in the credit and financial markets and industry slowdowns in recent periods have caused, and may continue to cause, some suppliers toscale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other companies, or file for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations, potentially affecting Applieds ability to obtain quality parts on a timely basis. Applied may also experiencesignificant interruptions of its manufacturing operations, delays in its ability to deliver products or services, increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of:     the failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective basis;     volatility in the availability and cost of materials, including rare earth elements;     difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals;     information technology or infrastructure failures;      natural disasters or other events (such as earthquakes, floods or storms, regional economic downturns, pandemics, social unrest, political instability,terrorism, or acts of war).  If a supplier fails to meet Applieds requirements concerning quality, costor other performance factors, Applied may transfer its business to alternative sources, which could entail manufacturing delays, additional costs, or other difficulties. In addition, if Applied needs to rapidly increase its business andmanufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules, this may exacerbate any interruptions in   27 Table of ContentsApplieds manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on Applieds working capital. Moreover, if actual demand for Applieds products is different thanexpected, Applied may purchase more/fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery of parts. If Applied purchases inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize, or if customersreduce or delay orders, Applied may incur excess inventory charges. Any or all of these factors could materially and adversely affect Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations. Applied is exposed to risks associated with acquisitions and strategic investments. Applied has made, and in the future intends to make, acquisitions of or investments in, companies, technologies or products in existing,related or new markets for Applied. Most recently, in November 2011, Applied completed its acquisition of Varian Semiconductor Associates, Inc. (Varian), which was the Companys largest acquisition to date. Acquisitions involve numerous risks,including but not limited to:      diversion of managements attention from other operational matters;     inability to complete acquisitions as anticipated or at all, which in certain circumstances may require Applied to pay a termination fee to the targetcompany;      requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestituresand/or restrictions on the conduct of Applieds existing business or the acquired business;      ineffective integration of operations, systems, technologies, products or employees of an acquired business;     inability to realize anticipated synergies or other benefits;     failure to commercialize purchased technologies;      initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;     inability to capitalize on characteristics of new markets that may be significantly different from Applieds existing markets and wherecompetitors may have stronger market positions and customer relationships;      failure to attract, retain and motivate key employees from the acquired business;     exposure to new operational risks, rules, regulations, worker expectations, customs and practices to the extent acquired businesses are located inregions where Applied has not historically conducted business;      challenges associated with managing new, more diverse and more widespread operations, projects and people;     inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key technologies;     inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired companys internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and/or environmental,health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices;      impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements or worse-than-expectedperformance of the segment;      the risk of litigation or claims associated with a proposed or completed transaction;     unknown, underestimated and/or undisclosed commitments or liabilities; and     the inappropriate scale of acquired entities critical resources or facilities for business needs. Applied also makes strategic investments in other companies, including companies formed as joint ventures, which may decline in valueand/or not meet desired objectives. The success of these investments depends on various factors over which Applied may have limited or no control and, particularly with respect to joint ven-  28 Table of Contentstures, requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic partners. The risks to Applieds strategic investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market andmacroeconomic conditions and, as a result, the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges. Mergers and acquisitions and strategic investments are inherently subject to significant risks. If Applieddoes not successfully manage the risks associated with acquisitions and strategic investments, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Applied used existing cash and incurred debt obligations to acquire Varian that could affect its ability to respond to changes inbusiness conditions or otherwise adversely affect its business.  Applied financed the acquisition of Varian through acombination of existing cash balances and the net proceeds of senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1.75 billion issued on June 8, 2011. The reduction in cash balances, assumed lower interest income, and payments on thedebt obligations will reduce the availability of cash flow for general corporate or other purposes, such as further mergers and acquisitions. This in turn may reduce Applieds flexibility in responding to changes in its businesses and in theindustries in which it operates.  The ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital to Appliedssuccess.  Applieds success, competitiveness and ability to execute on its global strategies and maintain aculture of innovation depend in large part on its ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees, especially in critical positions and in growing markets. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuationsin global economic and industry conditions, Applieds organizational structure, competitors hiring practices, cost reduction activities (including workforce reductions and unpaid shutdowns), availability of career developmentopportunities, and the effectiveness of Applieds compensation and benefit programs, including its share-based programs. If Applied does not successfully attract, retain and motivate key employees, Applied may be unable to capitalize on itsopportunities and its business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.  Thefailure to successfully implement and conduct outsourcing activities and other operational initiatives could adversely affect results of operations.  To better align its costs with market conditions, locate closer to customers, enhance productivity, and improve efficiencies, Applied conducts certain engineering, software development, manufacturing,sourcing and other operations in regions outside the United States, including India, Taiwan, China, and Korea. Applied has implemented a distributed manufacturing model, under which certain manufacturing and supply chain activities are conducted invarious countries, including the United States, Europe, Israel, Singapore, Taiwan and other countries in Asia, and assembly of some systems is completed at customer sites. In addition, Applied outsources certain functions to third parties, includingcompanies in the United States, India, China, Korea, Malaysia and other countries. Outsourced functions include contract manufacturing, engineering, customer support, software development, information technology support, finance and administrativeactivities. The expanding role of third party providers has required changes to Applieds existing operations and the adoption of new procedures and processes for retaining and managing these providers, as well as redistributingresponsibilities as warranted, in order to realize the potential productivity and operational efficiencies, assure quality and continuity of supply, and protect the intellectual property of Applied and its customers, suppliers and other partners. IfApplied does not accurately forecast the amount, timing and mix of demand for products, or if contract manufacturers or other outsource providers fail to perform in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, Applieds ability to meetcustomer requirements could suffer, particularly during a market upturn.  In addition, Applied is implementing a comprehensiveprogram to better align its global organizations and processes, including initiatives to enhance the Asia supply chain and improve back office and information technology infrastructure for more efficient transaction processing. Applied also isimplementing a multi-year, company-wide program to transform certain business processes, including the transition to a single enterprise resource planning (ERP) software system to perform various functions. The implementation of additionalfunc-  29 Table of Contentstionality to the ERP system entails certain risks, including difficulties with changes in business processes that could disrupt Applieds operations, such as its ability to track orders andtimely ship products, project inventory requirements, manage its supply chain and aggregate financial and operational data. The implementation of new initiatives may not achieve the anticipated benefits and may divert managements attentionfrom other operational activities, negatively affect employee morale, or have other unintended consequences.  If Applied doesnot effectively develop and implement its outsourcing and relocation strategies, if required export and other governmental approvals are not timely obtained, if Applieds third party providers do not perform as anticipated, or if there aredelays or difficulties in enhancing business processes, Applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies, and may experience operational difficulties, increased costs (including energy and transportation),manufacturing interruptions or delays, inefficiencies in the structure and/or operation of its supply chain, loss of its intellectual property rights, quality issues, increased product time-to-market, and/or inefficient allocation of humanresources, any or all of which could materially and adversely affect Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations.  Applied may incur impairment charges to goodwill or long-lived assets.  Applied has a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions. Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but arereviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The review compares the fair value foreach of Applieds reporting units to its associated carrying value, including goodwill. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows,declines in the market price of Applied common stock, changes in Applieds strategies or product portfolio, and restructuring activities. Applieds valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments andassumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance. Applied may be required to record a charge to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined toexist, which could materially and adversely affect Applieds results of operations.  Applied is exposed to variousrisks related to legal proceedings or claims and protection of intellectual property rights.  Applied from time to timeis, and in the future may be, involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement, intellectual property rights, antitrust, environmental regulations, securities, contracts, product performance, product liability, unfaircompetition, misappropriation of trade secrets, employment, workplace safety, and other matters. Applied also on occasion receives notification from customers who believe that Applied owes them indemnification or other obligations related to claimsmade against such customers by third parties.  In February 2010, the Seoul Prosecutors Office for the Eastern District inKorea indicted certain employees of Applied Materials Korea (AMK), including the former head of AMK who at the time of indictment was a vice president of Applied Materials, Inc., along with employees of several other companies, alleging the improperreceipt and use of confidential information of Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (Samsung), a major customer. Hearings on these matters are ongoing in the Seoul Eastern District Court. Applied and Samsung entered into a settlement agreement effective asof November 1, 2010, which resolves potential civil claims related to this matter and which is separate from and does not affect the criminal proceedings.  Legal proceedings and claims, whether with or without merit, and associated internal investigations, may (1) be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct; (2) divertmanagements attention and other Applied resources; (3) inhibit Applieds ability to sell its products; (4) result in adverse judgments for damages, injunctive relief, penalties and fines; and/or (5) negatively affectApplieds business. There can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings, claims or investigations. If Applied is not able to favorably resolve or settle legal proceedings or claims, or in the event of anyadverse findings against Applied or any of its employees, Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and Applied may suffer harm to its reputation.   30 Table of ContentsApplieds success depends in significant part on the protection of its intellectualproperty and other rights. Infringement of Applieds rights by a third party, such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts, could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for Applied.Applieds intellectual property rights may not provide significant competitive advantages if they are circumvented, invalidated, rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, or if Applied does not adequately protect or assertthese rights. Furthermore, the laws and practices of other countries, including China, India, Taiwan and Korea, permit the protection and enforcement of Applieds rights to varying extents, which may not be sufficient to adequately protectApplieds rights. Applied previously entered into an arrangement with one of its competitors to decrease the risk of patent infringement lawsuits in the future. There can be no assurance that the intended results of this arrangement will beachieved or that Applied will be able to adequately protect its intellectual property rights with the restrictions associated with the arrangement. If Applied is not able to favorably resolve or settle claims, obtain or enforce intellectual propertyrights, obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, and/or successfully prosecute or defend its intellectual property position, Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adverselyaffected and Applied may suffer harm to its reputation.  Changes in tax rates or tax assets and liabilities could affectresults of operations.  As a global company, Applied is subject to taxation in the United States and various othercountries. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. Applieds future annual and quarterly tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the: (1) applicable tax laws;(2) amount and composition of pre-tax income in countries with differing tax rates; (3) plans of the Company to permanently reinvest certain funds held outside of the U.S.; or (4) valuation of Applieds deferred tax assets andliabilities.  To better align with the increasingly international nature of its business, Applied is transitioning certainmanufacturing, supply chain, and other operations into Asia, bringing these activities closer to customers. These changes are expected to result in a reduction of future operating costs. In Singapore, Applied has received authorization to use taxincentives that provide that certain income earned in Singapore will be subject to tax holidays or reduced income tax rates. To obtain the benefit of these tax provisions, Applied must meet requirements relating to various activities. Appliedsability to realize benefits from these provisions could be materially affected if, among other things, applicable requirements are not met, or if Applied incurs net losses for which it cannot claim a deduction. In addition, Applied is subject to regular examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and from time to timeinitiates amendments to previously filed tax returns. Applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes, whichrequires estimates and judgments. Although Applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will agree with such estimates. Applied may have to engage in litigation to achieve the resultsreflected in the estimates, which may be time-consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that Applied will be successful or that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in Appliedshistorical income tax provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect Applieds financial condition and results of operations.  Applied is subject to risks of non-compliance with environmental and safety regulations.  Applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in connection with its global business operations, including but not limited to: regulations related to the development, manufacture and use ofits products; recycling and disposal of materials used in its products or in producing its products; the operation of its facilities; and the use of its real property. The failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental andsafety regulations, such as those related to climate change, could result in: (1) significant remediation liabilities; (2) the imposition of fines; (3) the suspension or termination of the development, manufacture, sale or use ofcertain of its products; (4) limitations on the operation of its facilities or ability to use its real property; and/or (5) a decrease in the value of its real property, each of which could have a material adverse effect on Appliedsbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.   31 Table of ContentsApplied is exposed to various risks related to the regulatory environment. Applied is subject to various risks related to: (1) new, different, inconsistent or even conflicting laws, rulesand regulations that may be enacted by executive order, legislative bodies and/or regulatory agencies in the countries in which Applied operates; (2) disagreements or disputes between national or regional regulatory agencies related tointernational trade; and (3) the interpretation and application of laws, rules and regulations. For example, as a public company with global operations, Applied is subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations ofvarious governing bodies, including those related to financial and other disclosures, corporate governance, privacy, and anti-corruption. Changes in laws, regulations and standards may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters. Efforts tocomply with new and changing regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to complianceactivities. If Applied is found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance with applicable laws, rules or regulations, Applied could be subject to legal or regulatory sanctions, the publics and customers perception ofApplied could decline, and Applieds business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.   "
11,AMAT,APPLIED MATERIALS INC,2010-12-10,">Item 1A:  Risk    Factors     The following factors could materially affect Applieds    business, financial condition or results of operations and    should be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its    business, in addition to other information presented elsewhere    in this report. The    industries that Applied serves are volatile and difficult to    predict.     As a supplier to the global semiconductor, flat panel display,    solar and related industries, Applied is subject to business    cycles, the timing, length and volatility of which can be    difficult to predict and which vary by reportable segment. These    industries historically have been cyclical due to sudden changes    in customers manufacturing capacity and advanced    technology requirements and spending, which depend in part on    customers capacity utilization, production volumes,    end-use demand, and inventory levels relative to demand, as well    as the rate of technology transitions and customers access    to affordable capital. These changes have affected the timing    and amounts of customers purchases and investments in    technology, and continue to affect Applieds orders, net    sales, operating expenses and net income.     To meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves,    Applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage    its resources and production capacity for each of its segments    as well as across multiple segments. During periods of    increasing demand for its products, Applied must have sufficient    manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand;    effectively manage its supply chain; attract, retain and    motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees; and    continue to control costs. During periods of decreasing demand,    Applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with    prevailing market conditions; effectively manage its supply    chain; and motivate and retain key employees. If Applied does    not accurately forecast and timely and appropriately adapt to    changes in its business environment, Applieds business,    financial condition and results of operations may be materially    and adversely affected. Applied    is exposed to risks associated with the difficult financial    markets and uncertain global economy.     The tightening of the credit markets, disruption in the    financial markets, and global economic recession that began in    2008 contributed to significant slowdowns in the industries in    which Applied operates. Although economic and market conditions    have improved, continuing difficulties in the financial markets    and uncertainty regarding the global economic recovery are    posing challenges. The markets for semiconductors and flat panel    displays in particular depend largely on consumer spending.    Economic uncertainty exacerbates negative trends in consumer    spending and may cause certain Applied customers to push out,    cancel, or refrain from placing orders for equipment or    services, which may reduce net sales, reduce backlog, and affect    Applieds ability to convert backlog to sales. Difficulties    in obtaining capital, uncertain market conditions, or reduced    profitability may also cause some customers to scale back    operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or    file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations,    leading to customers reduced research and development    funding    and/or    capital expenditures and, in turn, lower sales    and/or    additional inventory or bad debt expense for Applied. These    conditions may also similarly affect key suppliers, which could    impair their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for    Applieds products or added costs. In addition, these    conditions may lead to strategic alliances by, or consolidation    of, other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect    Applieds ability to compete effectively.     Uncertainty about future economic and industry conditions also    makes it more challenging for Applied to forecast its operating    results, make business decisions, and identify the risks that    may affect its business, sources and uses of cash, financial    condition and results of operations. Applied may be required to    implement additional cost reduction efforts, including    restructuring activities,    and/or    modify its business model, which may adversely affect    Applieds ability to capitalize on opportunities in a    market recovery. In addition, Applied maintains an investment    portfolio that is subject to general credit, liquidity, foreign    exchange, market and interest rate risks. The risks to    Applieds investment portfolio may be exacerbated if    financial market conditions deteriorate and, as a result, the    value and liquidity of the investment portfolio and return on    pension assets could be negatively impacted and lead to    impairment charges. If Applied does not timely and appropriately    adapt to changes resulting from the uncertain    15Table of Contents    macroeconomic environment and industry conditions,    Applieds business, financial condition or results of    operations may be materially and adversely affected. Applied    is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the    various industries in which it operates.     The global semiconductor, flat panel display, solar and related    industries in which Applied operates are characterized by    ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries,    including:           increasing capital requirements for building and operating new    fabrication plants and customers ability to raise the    necessary capital, particularly in a difficult financial market;           differences in growth rates among the semiconductor, display and    solar industries;           the increasing importance of establishing, improving and    maintaining strong relationships with customers;           abrupt and unforeseen shifts in the nature and amount of    customer and end-user demand;           the increasing cost and complexity for customers to move from    product design to volume manufacturing, which may slow the    adoption rate for new manufacturing technology;           the need to reduce the total cost of manufacturing system    ownership, due in part to greater demand for lower-cost consumer    electronics as compared to business information technology    spending;           the heightened importance to customers of system reliability and    productivity and the effect on demand for fabrication systems as    a result of their increasing productivity, device yield and    reliability;           the increasing importance of, and difficulties in, developing    products with sufficient differentiation to influence    customers purchasing decisions;           requirements for shorter cycle times for the development,    manufacture and installation of manufacturing equipment;           price and performance trends for semiconductor devices, LCDs and    solar PVs, and the corresponding effect on demand for such    products;           the increasing importance of the availability of spare parts to    maximize the time that customers systems are available for    production;           the increasing role for and complexity of software in Applied    products; and           the increasing focus on reducing energy usage and improving the    environmental impact and sustainability associated with    manufacturing operations.     If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from    the ongoing changes in the semiconductor, flat panel display,    solar and related industries, its business, financial condition    and results of operations could be materially and adversely    affected. Applied    is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to    the semiconductor industry.     The greatest portion of Applieds consolidated net sales    and profitability historically has been derived from sales of    manufacturing equipment by the Silicon Systems Group to the    global semiconductor industry. In addition, a majority of the    revenues of Applied Global Services is from sales of service    products to semiconductor manufacturers. The semiconductor    industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to that    industry in addition to the general industry changes described    in the preceding risk factor, including:           the increasing cost of research and development due to many    factors, including: decreasing linewidths on a chip; the use of    new materials such as cobalt and yttrium; new and more complex    device structures; more applications and process steps;    increasing chip design costs; and the increasing cost and    complexity of integrated manufacturing processes;           the growing number of types and varieties of semiconductors and    number of applications across multiple substrate sizes;    16Table of Contents           differing market growth rates and capital requirements for    different applications, such as NAND Flash, DRAM, logic and    foundry, and the resulting effect on customers spending    patterns and on Applieds ability to compete in these    market segments;           the increasing cost and complexity for semiconductor    manufacturers to move more technically advanced capability and    smaller linewidths to volume manufacturing, and the resulting    impact on the rates of technology transition and investment in    capital equipment;           semiconductor manufacturers increasing adoption of more    productive 300mm systems in relation to 200mm system capacity,    and the resulting effect on demand for manufacturing equipment    and services;           the decreasing rate of capital expenditures as a percentage of    semiconductor manufacturers revenue;           shorter cycle times between customers order placement and    product shipment, which may lead to inventory write-offs and    manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease gross margin;           technology developments in related markets, such as lithography,    to which Applied may need to adapt;           competitive factors that make it difficult to enhance market    position;           the importance of growing market positions in larger market    segments, such as etch and inspection;           the increasing concentration of wafer starts in one country,    Korea, where Applieds service penetration and    service-revenue-per-wafer-start have been lower than in other    regions;           the increasing fragmentation of semiconductor markets, leading    certain markets to become too small to support the cost of a new    fabrication plant, while others require less technologically    advanced products; and           the cost, technical complexity and timing of a proposed    transition from 300mm to 450mm wafers.     If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from    the ongoing changes occurring in the semiconductor industry, its    business, financial condition and results of operations could be    materially and adversely affected. Applied    is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to    the flat panel display industry.     The global flat panel display industry historically has    experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment    investment levels, due in part to the limited number of LCD    manufacturers and the concentrated nature of LCD end-use    applications. Recently, industry growth has depended to a    considerable extent on consumer demand for increasingly larger    and more advanced TVs. In addition to the general industry    changes described above in the third risk factor, the display    industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to that    industry, including:           the planned expansion of manufacturing facilities in China by    Chinese display manufacturers as well as manufacturers from    other countries, and the ability of non-Chinese manufacturers to    obtain government approvals;           technical and financial difficulties associated with    transitioning to larger substrate sizes for LCDs;           the effect of a slowing rate of transition to larger substrate    sizes on capital intensity and product differentiation;           technical difficulties and costs associated with developing new    technologies for use in LCD manufacturing, such as LEDs for    backlighting;           new energy efficiency standards for large-screen LCD    TVs; and           uncertainty with respect to future LCD technology end-use    applications and growth drivers.     If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from    the ongoing changes occurring in the display industry, its    business, financial condition and results of operations could be    materially and adversely affected.    17Table of ContentsApplied    is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to    the solar industry.     Applied anticipates that an increasing portion of its business    will be in the emerging solar market, which, in addition to the    general industry changes described above in the third risk    factor, is characterized by ongoing changes specific to the    solar industry, including:           the need to continually decrease the    cost-per-watt    of electricity produced by solar PV products by, among other    things, reducing operating costs and increasing throughputs for    solar PV manufacturing, and improving the conversion efficiency    of solar PVs;           the impact on demand for solar PV products arising from the cost    of electricity generated by solar PVs compared to the cost of    electricity from the existing grid or other energy sources;           the varying energy policies of governments around the world and    their effect in influencing the rate of growth of the solar PV    market, including the availability and amount of government    incentives for solar power such as tax credits, feed-in tariffs,    rebates, renewable portfolio standards that require electricity    providers to sell a targeted amount of energy from renewable    sources, and goals for solar installations on government    facilities;           the cost of polysilicon and other materials;           changes in the nature and amount of end demand for solar PVs    that may adversely impact the sales growth rates and    profitability of Applieds products;           varying levels of infrastructure investment for smart    grid technologies to modernize and enhance the    transmission, distribution and use of electricity, which link    distributed solar PV sources to population centers, increase    transmission capability, and optimize power usage;           access to affordable financing and capital by customers and    end-users; and           the growing number of solar PV manufacturers and increasing    global production capacity for solar PVs, primarily in China as    a result of increased solar subsidies and lower manufacturing    costs, which may lead to oversupply.     If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from    the ongoing changes occurring in the solar industry, its    business, financial condition and results of operations could be    materially and adversely affected. Applied    must adapt its business and product offerings to respond to    competition and rapid technological changes.     As Applied operates in a highly competitive environment, its    future success depends on many factors, including the effective    commercialization and customer acceptance of its equipment,    services and related products. In addition, Applied must    successfully execute its growth strategy, including enhancing    market share in existing markets, expanding into related    markets, cultivating new markets and exceeding industry growth    rates, while constantly improving its operational performance.    The development, introduction and support of a broadening set of    products in more varied competitive environments have grown    increasingly complex and expensive over time. Furthermore, new    or improved products may entail higher costs and reduced    profits. Applieds performance may be adversely affected if    it does not timely, cost-effectively and successfully:           develop new products, improve    and/or    develop new applications for existing products, and adapt    similar products for use by customers in different applications    and/or    markets with varying technical requirements;           appropriately price and achieve market acceptance of products;           differentiate its products from those of competitors and any    disruptive technologies, meet performance specifications, and    drive efficiencies and cost reductions;           maintain operating flexibility to enable different responses to    different markets, customers and applications;    18Table of Contents           allocate resources, including people and R&D funding, among    Applieds products and between the development of new    products and the enhancement of existing products, as most    appropriate and effective for future growth;           reduce the cost of, and improve the productivity of capital    invested in, R&D activities;           accurately forecast demand, work with suppliers and meet    production schedules for its products;           improve its manufacturing processes and achieve cost    efficiencies across product offerings;           adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different    parts of the supply chain;           qualify products for volume manufacturing with its    customers; and           implement changes in its design engineering methodology,    including those that enable reduction of material costs and    cycle time, greater commonality of platforms and types of parts    used in different systems, greater effectiveness of product life    cycle management, and reduced energy usage and environmental    impact.     If Applied does not successfully manage these challenges, its    business, financial condition and results of operations could be    materially and adversely affected. Operating    in multiple industries, and the entry into new markets and    industries, entail additional challenges.     As part of its growth strategy, Applied must successfully expand    into related or new markets and industries, either with its    existing products or with new products developed internally or    obtained through acquisitions. The entry into different markets    involves additional challenges, including those arising from:           the need to devote additional resources to develop new products    for, and operate in, new markets;           differing rates of profitability and growth among multiple    businesses;           Applieds ability to anticipate demand, capitalize on    opportunities, and avoid or minimize risks;           the complexity of managing multiple businesses with variations    in production planning, execution, supply chain management and    logistics;           the adoption of new business models;           the need to undertake activities to grow demand for end-products;           the need to develop adequate new business processes and systems;           Applieds ability to rapidly expand its operations to meet    increased demand and the associated effect on working capital;           new materials, processes and technologies;           the need to attract, motivate and retain employees with skills    and expertise in these new areas;           new and more diverse customers and suppliers, including some    with limited operating histories, uncertain    and/or    limited funding, evolving business models    and/or    locations in regions where Applied does not have existing    operations;           different customer service requirements;           new or different competitors with potentially more financial or    other resources, industry experience    and/or    established customer relationships;           entry into new industries and countries, with differing levels    of government involvement, laws and regulations, and business,    employment and safety practices;           third parties intellectual property rights; and           the need to comply with, or work to establish, industry    standards and practices.    19Table of Contents     In addition, Applied has begun applying for and receiving    funding from United States and other government agencies for    certain strategic development programs to increase its R&D    resources and address new market opportunities. As a condition    to this government funding, Applied may be subject to certain    record-keeping, audit, intellectual property rights-sharing    and/or other    obligations.     If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from    its diversification and entry into new markets and industries,    its business, financial condition and results of operations    could be materially and adversely affected. Applied    is exposed to the risks of operating a global    business.     In fiscal 2010, approximately 88 percent of Applieds    net sales were to customers in regions outside the    United States. Certain of Applieds R&D and    manufacturing facilities, as well as suppliers to Applied, are    also located outside the United States, including in Singapore,    Taiwan, China, Korea, Israel, Italy and Switzerland. Applied is    also expanding its business and operations in new countries. The    global nature of Applieds business and operations presents    challenges, including but not limited to those arising from:           varying regional and geopolitical business conditions and    demands;           political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations and    policies within countries that favor domestic companies over    non-domestic companies, including customer- or    government-supported efforts to promote the development and    growth of local competitors;           variations among, and changes in, local, regional, national or    international laws and regulations (including intellectual    property, labor, tax, and import /export laws), as well as the    interpretation and application of such laws and regulations;           global trade issues, including those related to the    interpretation and application of import and export licenses;           positions taken by governmental agencies regarding possible    national commercial    and/or    security issues posed by international business operations;           fluctuating raw material, commodity and energy costs;           challenges associated with managing more geographically diverse    operations and projects ;           varying customs, practices and expectations of workers in    different regions;           variations in the ability to develop relationships with local    customers, suppliers and governments;           fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates,    including the relative strength or weakness of the    U.S. dollar and the euro;           the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in    different locations;           political instability, natural disasters (such as earthquakes,    floods or storms), pandemics, terrorism or acts of war in    locations where Applied has operations, suppliers or sales;           cultural and language differences;           shipping costs    and/or    delays;           the need to continually improve the Companys operating    cost structure;           difficulties and uncertainties associated with the entry into    new countries;           uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various    countries; and           uncertainties with respect to growth rates for the manufacture    and sales of semiconductors, LCDs and solar PVs in the    developing economies of certain countries.     Many of these challenges are present in China and Korea, which    are experiencing significant growth of both suppliers and    competitors to Applied. Applied further believes that China and    Korea present large potential markets    20Table of Contents    for its products and opportunity for growth over the long term,    although at lower projected levels of profitability and margins    for certain products than historically have been achieved in    other regions. In addition, Applied must regularly reassess the    size, capability and location of its global infrastructure and    make appropriate changes, and must have effective change    management processes and procedures to address changes in its    business and operations. These challenges may materially and    adversely affect Applieds business, financial condition    and results of operations. Applied    is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated    customer base.     Applieds semiconductor and flat panel display customer    bases historically have been, and are becoming even more, highly    concentrated as a result of economic and industry conditions.    For example, in fiscal 2010, four semiconductor manufacturers    accounted for 51 percent of Silicon Systems Group net    sales, and five LCD manufacturers accounted for 71 percent    of Display net sales.Certain customers have experienced    significant ownership or management changes, consolidated with    other manufacturers, outsourced manufacturing activities, or    engaged in collaboration or cooperation arrangements with other    manufacturers. In addition, customers have entered into    strategic alliances or industry consortia that have increased    the influence of key industry participants in technology    decisions made by their partners. Also, certain semiconductor    and display customers are making an increasingly greater    percentage of their respective industrys capital equipment    investments.     In this environment, contracts or orders from a relatively    limited number of semiconductor and display manufacturers have    accounted for, and are expected to continue to account for, a    substantial portion of Applieds business, which may result    in added complexities in managing customer relationships and    transactions. In addition, the mix and type of customers, and    sales to any single customer, may vary significantly from    quarter to quarter and from year to year. If customers do not    place orders, or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel    orders, Applied may not be able to replace the business. As    Applieds products are configured to customer    specifications, changing, rescheduling or canceling orders may    result in significant, non-recoverable costs. Major customers    may also seek, and on occasion receive, pricing, payment,    intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that    are less favorable to Applied. These factors could have a    material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial    condition and results of operations. Manufacturing    interruptions or delays could affect Applieds ability to    meet customer demand and lead to higher costs, while the failure    to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or    obsolete inventory.     Applieds business depends on its timely supply of    equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly    changing technical and volume requirements of its customers,    which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts,    components and subassemblies (collectively, parts) from    suppliers and timely performance by contract manufacturers. Some    key parts may be subject to long lead-times    and/or    obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of    suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by    suppliers located in countries other than the United States,    including China and Korea. Cyclical industry conditions and the    volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase    capital, technical, operational and other risks for companies    throughout Applieds supply chain. Further, the adverse    conditions in the credit and financial markets and industry    slowdowns in recent periods have caused, and may continue to    cause, some suppliers to scale back operations, exit businesses,    merge with other companies, or file for bankruptcy protection    and possibly cease operations, potentially affecting    Applieds ability to obtain quality parts on a timely    basis. Applied may experience significant interruptions of its    manufacturing operations, delays in its ability to deliver    products or services, increased costs or customer order    cancellations as a result of:           the failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver    sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective basis;           volatility in the availability and cost of materials;           difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export    approvals;           information technology or infrastructure failures;    21Table of Contents           natural disasters (such as earthquakes, floods or    storms); or           other causes (such as regional economic downturns, pandemics,    political instability, terrorism, or acts of war) that could    result in delayed deliveries, manufacturing inefficiencies,    increased costs or order cancellations.     In addition, Applieds need to rapidly increase its    business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand    or expedited shipment schedules may exacerbate any interruptions    in Applieds manufacturing operations and supply chain and    the associated effect on Applieds working capital.    Moreover, if actual demand for Applieds products is    different than expected, Applied may purchase more/fewer parts    than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or    expediting delivery of parts. If Applied purchases inventory in    anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize, or if    customers reduce or delay orders, Applied may incur excess    inventory charges. Any or all of these factors could materially    and adversely affect Applieds business, financial    condition and results of operations. Applied    is exposed to risks associated with acquisitions and strategic    investments.     Applied has made, and in the future intends to make,    acquisitions of, and investments in, companies, technologies or    products in existing, related or new markets for Applied.    Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including but not limited    to:           diversion of managements attention from other operational    matters;           inability to complete acquisitions as anticipated or at all;           inability to realize anticipated benefits;           failure to commercialize purchased technologies;           inability to capitalize on characteristics of new markets that    may be significantly different from Applieds existing    markets and where competitors may have stronger market positions    and customer relationships;           failure to attract, retain and motivate key employees from the    acquired business;           exposure to new operational risks, rules, regulations, worker    expectations, customs and practices to the extent acquired    businesses are located in countries where Applied has not    historically conducted business;           challenges associated with managing new, more diverse and more    widespread operations, projects and people;           inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in    key technologies;           inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired companys    internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures,    and/or    environmental, health & safety, human resource, or    other policies or practices;           impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a    result of changing business conditions, technological    advancements or    worse-than-expected    performance of the segment;           the risk of litigation or disputes with customers, suppliers,    partners or stockholders of an acquisition target arising from a    proposed or completed transaction;           unknown, underestimated    and/or    undisclosed commitments or liabilities;           inappropriate scale of acquired entities critical    resources or facilities for business needs; and           ineffective integration of operations, systems, technologies,    products or employees of an acquired business.     Applied also makes strategic investments in other companies,    including companies formed as joint ventures, which may decline    in value    and/or not    meet desired objectives. The success of these investments    depends on various factors over which Applied may have limited    or no control and, particularly with respect to joint ventures,    requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic    partners. The risks to Applieds strategic investment    portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and    macroeconomic conditions and, as a result, the value of the    22Table of Contents    investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to    impairment charges. Mergers and acquisitions and strategic    investments are inherently subject to significant risks, and the    inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and    adversely affect Applieds business, financial condition    and results of operations. If Applied does not successfully    manage the risks associated with acquisitions and strategic    investments, its business, financial condition and results of    operations could be materially and adversely affected. The    ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital    to Applieds success.     Applieds success and competitiveness depend in large part    on its ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees.    Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors,    including fluctuations in global economic and industry    conditions, changes in Applieds management or leadership,    competitors hiring practices, cost reduction activities    (including workforce reductions), and the effectiveness of    Applieds compensation and benefit programs, including its    share-based programs. Applied periodically evaluates its overall    compensation program and makes adjustments, as appropriate, to    enhance its competitiveness. If Applied does not successfully    attract, retain and motivate key employees, Applied may be    unable to capitalize on its opportunities and its operating    results may be materially and adversely affected. The    failure to successfully implement and conduct outsourcing    activities and other operational initiatives could adversely    affect results of operations.     To better align its costs with market conditions, locate closer    to customers, enhance productivity, and improve efficiencies,    Applied conducts engineering, software development,    manufacturing, sourcing and other operations in regions outside    the United States, including India, China, and Korea. Applied is    implementing a more distributed manufacturing model, which    includes transitioning certain manufacturing and supply chain    activities from the United States and Europe to Singapore,    Taiwan and other countries in Asia and completing assembly of    some systems at the customer site. In addition, Applied    outsources certain functions to third parties, including    companies in the United States, India, China, Korea and other    countries. Outsourced functions include contract manufacturing,    engineering, customer support, software development, information    technology support, finance and administrative activities. The    expanding role of third party providers has required changes to    Applieds existing operations and the adoption of new    procedures and processes for retaining and managing these    providers, as well as redistributing responsibilities as    warranted, in order to realize the potential productivity and    operational efficiencies, assure quality and continuity of    supply, and protect Applieds intellectual property. If    Applied does not accurately forecast the amount, timing and mix    of demand for products, or if contract manufacturers or other    outsource providers fail to perform in a timely manner or at    satisfactory quality levels, Applieds ability to meet    customer requirements could suffer, particularly during a market    upturn.     In addition, Applied is implementing a comprehensive program to    better align its global organizations and processes, including    initiatives to enhance the Asia supply chain, integrate its    sales teams into the business units, and improve back office and    information technology infrastructure for more efficient    transaction processing. Applied also is implementing a    multi-year, company-wide program to transform certain business    processes, including the transition to a single enterprise    resource planning (ERP) software system to perform various    functions. The implementation of additional functionality to the    ERP system entails certain risks, including difficulties with    changes in business processes that could disrupt Applieds    operations, such as its ability to track orders and timely ship    products, project inventory requirements, manage its supply    chain and aggregate financial and operational data. The    implementation of new initiatives may not achieve the    anticipated benefits and may divert managements attention    from other operational activities, negatively affect employee    morale, or have other unintended consequences.     If Applied does not effectively develop and implement its    outsourcing and relocation strategies, if required export and    other governmental approvals are not timely obtained, if    Applieds third party providers do not perform as    anticipated, or if there are delays or difficulties in enhancing    business processes, Applied may not realize anticipated    productivity improvements or cost efficiencies, and may    experience operational difficulties, increased costs (including    energy and transportation), manufacturing interruptions or    delays, inefficiencies in the structure    and/or    operation of its supply chain, loss of its intellectual property    rights, quality issues, increased product    23Table of Contentstime-to-market,and/or    inefficient allocation of human resources, any or all of which    could materially and adversely affect Applieds business,    financial condition and results of operations. Applied    may incur impairment charges to goodwill or long-lived    assets.     Applied has a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired    intangible assets related to acquisitions. Goodwill and    purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not    amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the    fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently when    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying    value of an asset may not be recoverable. The review compares    the fair value for each of Applieds reporting units to its    associated carrying value, including goodwill. Factors that    could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets    include adverse industry or economic trends, reduced estimates    of future cash flows, declines in the market price of Applied    common stock, changes in the Companys strategies or    product portfolio, and restructuring activities. Applieds    valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires    management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical    experience and projections of future operating performance.    Applied may be required to record a charge to earnings during    the period in which an impairment of goodwill or amortizable    intangible assets is determined to exist, which could materially    and adversely affect Applieds results of operations. Applied    is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or    claims and protection of intellectual property    rights.     Applied from time to time is, and in the future may be, involved    in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement,    intellectual property rights, antitrust, environmental    regulations, securities, contracts, product performance, product    liability, unfair competition, misappropriation of trade    secrets, employment, workplace safety, and other matters.    Applied also on occasion receives notification from customers    who believe that Applied owes them indemnification or other    obligations related to claims made against such customers by    third parties.     In February 2010, the Seoul Prosecutors Office for the    Eastern District in Korea indicted certain employees of Applied    Materials Korea (AMK), including the former head of AMK who at    the time of indictment was a vice president of Applied    Materials, Inc., along with employees of several other    companies, alleging the improper receipt and use of the    confidential information of Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.    (Samsung), a major customer. Hearings on these matters are    ongoing in the Seoul Eastern District Court.. Applied and    Samsung entered into a settlement agreement effective as of    November 1, 2010, which resolves potential civil claims    related to this matter and which is separate from and does not    affect the criminal proceedings.     Legal proceedings and claims, whether with or without merit, and    associated internal investigations, may (1) be    time-consuming and expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct;    (2) divert managements attention and other Applied    resources; (3) inhibit Applieds ability to sell its    products; (4) result in adverse judgments for damages,    injunctive relief, penalties and fines;    and/or    (5) negatively affect Applieds business. There can be    no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal    proceedings, claims or investigations. If Applied is not able to    favorably resolve or settle legal proceedings or claims, or in    the event of any adverse findings against Applied or any of its    employees, Applieds business, financial condition and    results of operations could be materially and adversely affected    and Applied may suffer harm to its reputation.     Applieds success depends in significant part on the    protection of its intellectual property and other rights.    Infringement of Applieds rights by a third party, such as    the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare    parts, could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue    opportunities for Applied. Applieds intellectual property    rights may not provide significant competitive advantages if    they are circumvented, invalidated, rendered obsolete by the    rapid pace of technological change, or if Applied does not    adequately protect or assert these rights. Furthermore, the laws    and practices of other countries, including China, India, Taiwan    and Korea, permit the protection and enforcement of    Applieds rights to varying extents, which may not be    sufficient to protect Applieds rights. Applied previously    entered into an arrangement with one of its competitors to    decrease the risk of patent infringement lawsuits in the future.    There can be no assurance that the intended results of this    arrangement will be achieved or that Applied will be able to    adequately protect its intellectual property rights with the    restrictions associated with the arrangement. If Applied is not    able to favorably resolve or settle claims, obtain or enforce    24Table of Contents    intellectual property rights, obtain necessary licenses on    commercially reasonable terms,    and/or    successfully prosecute or defend its intellectual property    position, Applieds business, financial condition and    results of operations could be materially and adversely affected    and Applied may suffer harm to its reputation. See Note 18    of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes    in tax rates or tax assets and liabilities could affect results    of operations.     As a global company, Applied is subject to taxation in the    United States and various other countries. Significant judgment    is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities.    Applieds future annual and quarterly tax rates could be    affected by numerous factors, including changes in the:    (1) applicable tax laws; (2) amount and composition of    pre-tax income in countries with differing tax rates; or    (3) valuation of Applieds deferred tax assets and    liabilities.     To better align with the increasingly international nature of    its business, Applied is transitioning certain manufacturing,    supply chain, and other operations into Asia, bringing these    activities closer to customers. These changes are expected to    result in a reduction of future operating costs. In Singapore,    Applied is pursuing available tax incentives that provide that    certain income earned in Singapore would be subject to tax    holidays or reduced income tax rates. To obtain these tax    benefits, Applied must meet requirements relating to various    activities. Applied is engaged in discussions with tax    authorities in Singapore and the United States concerning these    incentives. Applieds ability to realize benefits from    these initiatives could be materially affected if, among other    things, applicable requirements are not met, the incentives are    substantially modified, or if Applied incurs net losses for    which it cannot claim a deduction.     In addition, Applied is subject to regular examination by the    Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and from    time to time initiates amendments to previously filed tax    returns. Applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable    or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and    amendments to determine the adequacy of its provision for income    taxes, which requires estimates and judgments. Although Applied    believes its tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no    assurance that the tax authorities will agree with such    estimates. Applied may have to engage in litigation to achieve    the results reflected in the estimates, which may be    time-consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that    Applied will be successful or that any final determination will    not be materially different from the treatment reflected in    Applieds historical income tax provisions and accruals,    which could materially and adversely affect Applieds    financial condition and results of operations. Applied    is subject to risks of non-compliance with environmental and    safety regulations.     Applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in    connection with its global business operations, including but    not limited to: regulations related to the development,    manufacture and use of its products; recycling and disposal of    materials used in its products or in producing its products; the    operation of its facilities; and the use of its real property.    The failure or inability to comply with existing or future    environmental and safety regulations, such as those related to    climate change, could result in: (1) significant    remediation liabilities; (2) the imposition of fines;    (3) the suspension or termination of the development,    manufacture, sale or use of certain of its products;    (4) limitations on the operation of its facilities or    ability to use its real property;    and/or    (5) a decrease in the value of its real property, each of    which could have a material adverse effect on Applieds    business, financial condition and results of operations. Applied    is exposed to various risks related to the regulatory    environment.     Applied is subject to various risks related to: (1) new,    different, inconsistent or even conflicting laws, rules and    regulations that may be enacted by legislative bodies    and/or    regulatory agencies in the countries in which Applied operates;    (2) disagreements or disputes between national or regional    regulatory agencies related to international trade; and    (3) the interpretation and application of laws, rules and    regulations. For example, as a public company with global    operations, Applied is subject to the laws of multiple    jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing    bodies, including those related to financial and other    disclosures, corporate governance, privacy, and anti-corruption.    Changes in laws, regulations and standards may create    uncertainty regarding compliance matters. Efforts to comply with    new and changing regulations have resulted in, and are likely to    continue to result in, increased general and administrative    expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from    revenue-    25Table of Contents    generating activities to compliance activities. If Applied is    found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance    with applicable laws, rules or regulations, Applied could be    subject to legal or regulatory sanctions, the publics    perception of Applied could decline, and Applieds    business, financial condition and results of operations could be    materially and adversely affected. "
7,AMAT,APPLIED MATERIALS INC,2009-12-11,">Item 1A:  Risk    Factors     The following factors could materially affect Applieds    business, financial condition or results of operations and    should be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its    business, in addition to other information presented elsewhere    in this report. The    industries that Applied serves are volatile and difficult to    predict.     As a supplier to the global semiconductor, flat panel display,    solar and related industries, Applied is subject to business    cycles, the timing, length and volatility of which can be    difficult to predict and which vary by reportable segment. These    industries historically have been cyclical due to sudden changes    in customers manufacturing capacity requirements and    spending, which depend in part on customers capacity    utilization, production volumes, end-use demand, inventory    levels relative to demand, and access to affordable capital.    These changes have affected the timing and amounts of    customers purchases and investments in technology, and    continue to affect Applieds orders, net sales, operating    expenses and net income.     To meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves,    Applied must effectively manage its resources and production    capacity for each of its segments as well as across multiple    segments. The challenging economic and industry conditions have    adversely affected Applieds customers and led to a    significant decrease in demand for many of Applieds    products, although indications of improving conditions are    beginning to appear. During periods of increasing demand for its    products, Applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity    and inventory to meet customer demand; effectively manage its    supply chain; attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number    of qualified individuals; and continue to control costs. During    periods of decreasing demand, Applied must be able to    appropriately align its cost structure with prevailing market    conditions; effectively manage its supply chain; and motivate    and retain key employees. If Applied is not able to timely and    appropriately adapt to changes in its business environment,    Applieds business, financial condition or results of    operations may be materially and adversely affected. Applied    is exposed to risks associated with the difficult financial    markets and weak global economy.     The tightening of the credit markets, disruption in the    financial markets, and global economic downturn experienced over    the last several quarters contributed to significant slowdowns    in the industries in which Applied operates, which slowdowns may    persist or worsen if these economic conditions are prolonged or    deteriorate further. The markets for semiconductors and flat    panel displays in particular depend largely on consumer    spending. Economic uncertainty exacerbates negative trends in    consumer spending and may cause certain Applied customers to    push out, cancel, or refrain from placing orders for equipment    or services, which may reduce net sales, reduce backlog, and    affect Applieds ability to convert backlog to sales.    Difficulties in obtaining capital and uncertain market    conditions may also lead to the inability of some customers to    obtain affordable financing and to customer insolvencies,    resulting in lower sales    and/or    additional inventory or bad debt expense for Applied. These    conditions may also similarly affect key suppliers, which could    impair their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for    Applieds products. In addition, these conditions may lead    to strategic alliances by, or consolidation of, other equipment    manufacturers, which could adversely affect Applieds    ability to compete effectively.     Further, these adverse conditions and uncertainty about future    economic and industry conditions make it challenging for Applied    to forecast its operating results, make business decisions, and    identify the risks that may affect its business, sources and    uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations.    Applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction    efforts, including restructuring activities,    and/or    modify its business model, which may adversely affect    Applieds ability to capitalize on opportunities in a    market recovery. In addition, Applied maintains an investment    portfolio that is subject to general credit, liquidity, foreign    exchange, market and interest rate risks and that also includes    some exposure to asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities.    The risks to Applieds investment portfolio may be    exacerbated by deteriorating financial market conditions and, as    a result, the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio    could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges. If    Applied is not able to timely and appropriately adapt to changes    resulting from the difficult macroeconomic environment and    industry conditions, Applieds business, financial    condition or results of operations may be materially and    adversely affected.    14Table of ContentsApplied    is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the    various industries in which it operates.     The global semiconductor, flat panel display, solar and related    industries in which Applied operates are characterized by    ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries,    including:           increasing capital requirements for building and operating new    fabrication plants and customers ability to raise the    necessary capital, particularly in a difficult financial market;           differences in growth rates among the semiconductor, display and    solar industries;           abrupt and unforeseen shifts in the nature and amount of    customer and end-user demand;           the increasing cost and complexity for customers to move from    product design to volume manufacturing, which may slow the    adoption rate for new manufacturing technology;           the importance of reducing the total cost of manufacturing    system ownership, due in part to greater demand for lower-cost    consumer electronics as compared to business information    technology spending;           the heightened importance to customers of system reliability and    productivity and the effect on demand for fabrication systems as    a result of their increasing productivity, device yield and    reliability;           increased need to develop products with sufficient    differentiation to influence customers purchasing    decisions;           requirements for shorter cycle times for the development,    manufacture and installation of manufacturing equipment;           price and performance trends for semiconductor devices, LCDs and    solar PVs, and the corresponding effect on demand for such    products;           the increasing importance of the availability of spare parts to    maximize the time that customers systems are available for    production;           the increasing role for and complexity of software in Applied    products; and           the increasing focus on reducing energy usage and improving the    environmental impact and sustainability associated with    manufacturing operations.     If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from    the ongoing changes in the semiconductor, flat panel display,    solar and related industries, its business, financial condition    and results of operations could be materially and adversely    affected. Applied    is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to    the semiconductor industry.     The greatest portion of Applieds revenues and    profitability historically has been derived from sales of    manufacturing equipment to the global semiconductor industry. In    addition, a majority of the revenues of Applied Global Services    is from sales of service products to semiconductor    manufacturers. The semiconductor industry is characterized by    ongoing changes particular to that industry, in addition to the    general industry changes described in the preceding risk factor,    which may result in decreased spending by customers and    negatively impact the Companys financial condition and    results of operations. The changes include:           the increasing cost of research and development due to many    factors, including: decreasing linewidths on a chip; the use of    new materials such as cobalt and yttrium; more complex device    structures; more applications and process steps; increasing chip    design costs; and the increasing cost and complexity of an    integrated manufacturing process;           the growing number of types and varieties of semiconductors and    number of applications across multiple substrate sizes;           differing market growth rates and capital requirements for    different applications, such as memory (including NAND flash and    DRAM), logic and foundry, and Applieds ability to compete    in these market segments;    15Table of Contents           the increasing cost and complexity for semiconductor    manufacturers to move more technically advanced capability and    smaller linewidths to volume manufacturing, and the resulting    impact on the rates of technology transition and investment in    capital equipment;           semiconductor manufacturers increasing adoption of more    productive 300mm systems and reductions in 200mm system    capacity, and the resulting effect on demand for manufacturing    equipment and services;           the decreasing rate of capital expenditures as a percentage of    semiconductor manufacturers revenue;           the decreasing profitability of many semiconductor    manufacturers, causing them to enter into collaboration or    cost-sharing arrangements with other manufacturers, outsource    manufacturing activities, focus only on specific markets or    applications,    and/or    purchase less manufacturing equipment, which puts downward    pressure on sales prices for, and the rate of investment in,    capital equipment;           technology developments in related markets, such as lithography,    to which Applied may need to adapt;           competitive factors that make it difficult to enhance market    position, especially in larger market segments such as etch;           the increasing market fragmentation for semiconductors, leading    certain markets to become too small to support the cost of a new    fabrication plant; and           the cost, technical complexity and timing of a proposed    transition from 300mm to 450mm wafers.     If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from    the ongoing changes occurring in the semiconductor industry, its    business, financial condition and results of operations could be    materially and adversely affected. Applied    is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to    the flat panel display industry.     The global flat panel display industry historically has    experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment    investment levels, due in part to the limited number of LCD    manufacturers and the concentrated nature of LCD end-use    applications. Recently, industry growth has depended to a    considerable extent on consumer demand for increasingly larger    and more advanced TVs. In addition to the general industry    changes described above in the third risk factor, the display    industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to that    industry, including:           technical and financial difficulties associated with    transitioning to larger substrate sizes for LCDs;           the effect of a slowing rate of transition to larger substrate    sizes on capital intensity and product differentiation;           new energy efficiency standards for large-screen LCD TVs    ; and           uncertainty with respect to future LCD technology end-use    applications and growth drivers.     If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from    the ongoing changes occurring in the display industry, its    business, financial condition and results of operations could be    materially and adversely affected. Applied    is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to    the solar industry.     Applied anticipates that an increasing portion of its business    will be in the emerging solar market, which, in addition to the    general industry changes described above in the third risk    factor, is characterized by ongoing changes specific to the    solar industry, including:           the impact on demand for solar PV products arising from the cost    and performance of solar PV technology compared to the cost of    electricity from the existing grid or other energy sources;           the critical role played by energy policies of governments    around the world in influencing the rate of growth of the solar    market including the availability and amount of government    incentives for solar power such as tax credits, rebates,    renewable portfolio standards that require electricity providers    to sell a targeted amount of energy from renewable sources, and    goals for solar installations on government facilities;    16Table of Contents           changes in the nature and amount of end demand for solar PVs    that adversely impact the profitability and growth rates of    Applieds products;           the extent of investment or participation in the solar market by    utilities that generate, transmit or distribute power to    end-users;           evolving industry standards, such as a standard form factor for    thin film solar modules;           varying levels of infrastructure investment for smart    grid technologies to modernize and enhance the    transmission, distribution and use of electricity, which link    distributed solar PV sources to population centers, increase    transmission capability, and optimize power usage;           regulatory and third party certification requirements, and    customers ability to timely satisfy such requirements;           the increasing rates of production of solar PVs in China;           access to affordable financing and capital by customers and    end-users; and           increasingly greater factory output and scalability of solar PVs.     If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from    the ongoing changes occurring in the solar industry, its    business, financial condition and results of operations could be    materially and adversely affected. Applied    must adapt its business and product offerings to respond to    competition and rapid technological changes.     As Applied operates in a highly competitive environment, its    future success depends on many factors, including the effective    commercialization and customer acceptance of its    nanomanufacturing technology equipment, service and related    products. In addition, Applied must successfully execute its    growth strategy, including enhancing market share in existing    markets, expanding into related markets, cultivating new markets    and exceeding industry growth rates, while constantly improving    its operational performance. The development, introduction and    support of a broadening set of products in more varied    competitive environments have grown increasingly complex and    expensive over time. Furthermore, new or improved products may    entail higher costs and reduced profits. Applieds success    is subject to many risks, including but not limited to its    ability to timely, cost-effectively and successfully:           develop new products, improve    and/or    develop new applications for existing products, and adapt    similar products for use by customers in different applications    and/or    markets with varying technical requirements;           appropriately price and achieve market acceptance of products;           differentiate its products from those of competitors and any    disruptive technologies, meet performance specifications, and    drive efficiencies and cost reductions;           maintain operating flexibility to enable different responses to    different markets, customers and applications;           grow the profitability and market acceptance of its thin film    solar products;           allocate resources, including people and R&D funding, among    Applieds products and between the development of new    products and the enhancement of existing products, as most    appropriate and effective for future growth;           accurately forecast demand, work with suppliers and meet    production schedules for its products;           improve its manufacturing processes and achieve cost    efficiencies across product offerings;           adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different    parts of the supply chain;           qualify products for volume manufacturing with its customers;    17Table of Contents           implement changes in its design engineering methodology,    including those that enable reduction of material costs and    cycle time, greater commonality of platforms and types of parts    used in different systems, greater effectiveness of product life    cycle management, and reduced energy usage and environmental    impact; and           accomplish the simultaneous    start-up of    multiple integrated thin film solar production lines.     If Applied does not successfully manage these challenges, its    business, financial condition and results of operations could be    materially and adversely affected. Operating    in multiple industries and the entry into new markets and    industries entail additional challenges.     As part of its growth strategy, Applied must successfully expand    into related or new markets and industries, either with its    existing nanomanufacturing technology products or with new    products developed internally or obtained through acquisitions.    The entry into different markets involves additional challenges,    including those arising from:           the need to devote additional resources to develop new products    for, and operate in, new markets;           differing rates of profitability and growth among its multiple    businesses;           Applieds ability to anticipate demand, capitalize on    opportunities, and avoid or minimize risks;           the complexity of managing multiple businesses with variations    in production planning, execution, supply chain management and    logistics;           the adoption of new business models, such as the supply of an    integrated production line consisting of a suite of Applied and    non-Applied equipment to manufacture solar PVs;           the need to undertake activities to grow demand for end-products;           the need to develop adequate new business processes and systems;           Applieds ability to rapidly expand its operations to meet    increased demand and the associated effect on working capital;           new materials, processes and technologies;           the need to attract, motivate and retain employees with skills    and expertise in these new areas;           new and more diverse customers and suppliers, including some    with limited operating histories, uncertain    and/or    limited funding, evolving business models    and/or    locations in regions where Applied does not have existing    operations;           different customer service requirements;           new and/or    different competitors with potentially more financial or other    resources and industry experience;           entry into new industries and countries, with differing levels    of government involvement, laws and regulations, and business,    employment and safety practices;           third parties intellectual property rights; and           the need to comply with, or work to establish, industry    standards and practices.     If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from    its diversification and entry into new markets and industries,    its business, financial condition and results of operations    could be materially and adversely affected. Applied    is exposed to the risks of operating a global    business.     In fiscal 2009, approximately 81 percent of Applieds    net sales were to customers in regions outside the    United States. Certain of Applieds R&D    and/or    manufacturing facilities, as well as suppliers to Applied, are    also located outside the United States, including in China.    Applied is also expanding its business and operations in new    18Table of Contents    countries. The global nature of Applieds business and    operations presents challenges, including but not limited to    those arising from:           varying regional and geopolitical business conditions and    demands;           changes in political and social attitudes, laws, rules,    regulations and policies to favor domestic companies over    non-domestic companies;           variations among, and changes in, local, regional, national or    international laws and regulations (including tax and import    /export restrictions), as well as the interpretation and    application of such laws and regulations;           global trade issues, including those related to the    interpretation and application of import and export licenses;           variations in protection of intellectual property and other    legal rights;           positions taken by U.S. governmental agencies regarding    possible national commercial    and/or    security issues posed by international business operations;           fluctuating raw material and energy costs;           variations in the ability to develop relationships with    suppliers and other local businesses;           fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates,    including the relative strength or weakness of the    U.S. dollar;           the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in    different locations;           political instability, natural disasters (such as earthquakes,    floods or storms), pandemics, terrorism or acts of war in    locations where Applied has operations, suppliers or sales;           cultural differences;           customer- or government-supported efforts to promote the    development and growth of local competitors;           shipping costs    and/or    delays;           the need to continually improve the Companys operating    cost structure;           difficulties and uncertainties associated with the entry into    new countries;           uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various    countries; and           uncertainties with respect to growth rates for the manufacture    and sales of semiconductors, LCDs and solar PVs in the    developing economies of certain countries.     Many of these challenges are present in China, which is    experiencing significant growth of both suppliers and    competitors to Applied. Applied further believes that China    presents a large potential market for its products and    opportunity for growth over the long term, although at lower    projected levels of profitability and margins than historically    have been achieved in other regions. In addition, Applied must    regularly reassess the size, capability and location of its    global infrastructure and make appropriate changes, and must    have effective change management processes and procedures to    address changes in its business and operations. These challenges    may materially and adversely affect Applieds business,    financial condition and results of operations. Applied    is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated    customer base.     Applieds semiconductor and flat panel display customer    bases historically have been, and are becoming even more, highly    concentrated as a result of industry conditions. These    conditions are also adversely affecting customers    profitability and access to capital, which leads to lower    R&D funding and capital expenditures. In addition, certain    customers have entered into strategic alliances or industry    consortia that have increased the influence of key industry    participants in technology decisions made by their partners. In    the solar area, while the number of solar PV manufacturing    customers increases as the number of market entrants grows, the    size of contracts with particular customers is expected to rise    substantially as the industry moves to greater solar module    19Table of Contents    factory output capacity. The ongoing adverse conditions in the    credit and financial markets and industry slowdowns have caused,    and may continue to cause, some customers to postpone delivery,    reduce or cancel orders, exit businesses, merge with other    manufacturers or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially    cease operations. In this environment, contracts or orders from    a relatively limited number of semiconductor, display and solar    manufacturers have accounted for, and are expected to continue    to account for, a substantial portion of Applieds    business. In addition, the mix and type of customers, and sales    to any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to    quarter and from year to year. If customers do not place orders,    or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel orders, Applied    may not be able to replace the business. As Applieds    products are configured to customer specifications, changing,    rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant,    non-recoverable costs. Major customers may also seek, and on    occasion receive, pricing, payment, intellectual    property-related, or other commercial terms that are less    favorable to Applied. In addition, certain customers have    undergone significant ownership    and/or    management changes, outsourced manufacturing activities, engaged    in collaboration or cooperation arrangements with other    customers, or consolidated with other customers, each of which    may result in additional complexities in managing customer    relationships and transactions, as well as cancelled or    decreased orders and lower net sales. These factors could have a    material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial    condition and results of operations. Applied    is exposed to risks associated with acquisitions and strategic    investments.     Applied has made, and in the future intends to make,    acquisitions of, and investments in, companies, technologies or    products in existing, related or new markets for Applied.    Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including but not limited    to:           diversion of managements attention from other operational    matters;           inability to complete acquisitions as anticipated or at all;           inability to realize anticipated benefits;           failure to commercialize purchased technologies;           inability to capitalize on characteristics of new markets that    may be significantly different from Applieds existing    markets and where competitors may have stronger market positions;           failure to attract, retain and motivate key employees from the    acquired business;           exposure to operational risks, rules and regulations to the    extent such activities are located in countries where Applied    has not historically conducted business;           challenges associated with managing larger, more diverse and    more widespread operations;           inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in    key technologies;           inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired companys    internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures,    and/or    environmental, health & safety, human resource, or    other policies;           impairment of acquired intangible assets as a result of    technological advancements or    worse-than-expected    performance of the acquired company or its product offerings;           the risk of litigation or disputes with customers, suppliers,    partners or stockholders of an acquisition target arising from a    proposed or completed transaction;           unknown, underestimated    and/or    undisclosed commitments or liabilities;           inappropriate scale of acquired entities critical    resources or facilities for business needs; and           ineffective integration of operations, systems, technologies,    products or employees of an acquired business.     Applied also makes strategic investments in other companies,    including companies formed as joint ventures, which may decline    in value    and/or not    meet desired objectives. The success of these investments    depends on various factors over which Applied may have limited    or no control and, particularly with respect to joint ventures,    requires    20Table of Contents    ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic partners. The    risks to Applieds strategic investment portfolio may be    exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic    conditions and, as a result, the value of the investment    portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment    charges. Mergers and acquisitions and strategic investments are    inherently subject to significant risks, and the inability to    effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely    affect Applieds business, financial condition and results    of operations. If Applied does not successfully manage the risks    associated with acquisitions and strategic investments, its    business, financial condition and results of operations could be    materially and adversely affected. Manufacturing    interruptions or delays could affect Applieds ability to    meet customer demand, while the failure to estimate customer    demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete    inventory.     Applieds business depends on its ability to timely supply    equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly    changing technical and volume requirements of its customers,    which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts,    components and subassemblies (collectively, parts) from    suppliers. Some key parts may be subject to long lead-times    and/or    obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of    suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by    suppliers located in countries other than the United States,    including China. Further, the ongoing adverse conditions in the    credit and financial markets and industry slowdowns have caused,    and may continue to cause, some suppliers to scale back    operations, exit businesses, merge with other companies, or file    for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations,    potentially affecting Applieds ability to obtain parts.    Applied may experience significant interruptions of its    manufacturing operations, delays in its ability to deliver    products or services, increased costs or customer order    cancellations as a result of:           the failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver quality    parts;           volatility in the availability and cost of materials;           difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export    approvals;           information technology or infrastructure failures;           natural disasters (such as earthquakes, floods or    storms); or           other causes (such as regional economic downturns, pandemics,    political instability, terrorism, or acts of war) that could    result in delayed deliveries, manufacturing inefficiencies,    increased costs or order cancellations.     In addition, Applieds need to rapidly increase its    business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand    or expedited shipment schedules may exacerbate any interruptions    in Applieds manufacturing operations and supply chain and    the associated effect on Applieds working capital.    Moreover, if actual demand for Applieds products is    different than expected, Applied may purchase more/fewer parts    than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or    expediting delivery of parts. The volatility of demand for    capital equipment increases capital, technical and other risks    for companies in the supply chain. Any or all of these factors    could materially and adversely affect Applieds business,    financial condition and results of operations. The    failure to successfully implement and conduct off-shoring and    outsourcing activities and other operational initiatives could    adversely affect results of operations.     To better align its costs with market conditions, increase its    presence in growing markets, enhance productivity, and improve    efficiencies, Applied conducts engineering, software development    and other operations in regions outside the United States,    particularly India and China, and outsources certain functions    to third parties, including companies in the United States,    India, China and other countries. Outsourced functions include    certain engineering, manufacturing, customer support, software    development, information technology support, finance and    administrative activities. The expanding role of third party    providers has required changes to Applieds existing    operations and the adoption of new procedures and processes for    retaining and managing these providers, as well as    redistributing responsibilities as warranted, in order to    realize the potential productivity and operational efficiencies,    assure quality and continuity of supply, and protect    Applieds intellectual property. In addition, Applied has    implemented several key operational initiatives intended to    improve manufacturing efficiency, including    21Table of Contentsintegrate-to-order,    module-final-test and    merge-in-transit    programs. Applied also is implementing a multi-year,    company-wide program to transform certain business processes,    including the transition to a single enterprise resource    planning (ERP) software system to perform various functions. The    implementation of additional functionality to the ERP system    entails certain risks, including difficulties with changes in    business processes that could disrupt Applieds operations,    such as its ability to track orders and timely ship products,    project inventory requirements, manage its supply chain and    aggregate financial and operational data. The implementation of    new initiatives may not achieve the anticipated benefits and may    divert managements attention from other operational    activities, negatively affect employee morale, or have other    unintended consequences.     If Applied does not effectively develop and implement its    off-shoring and outsourcing strategies, if required export and    other governmental approvals are not timely obtained, if    Applieds third party providers do not perform as    anticipated, or if there are delays or difficulties in    implementing a new ERP system or enhancing business processes,    Applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or    cost efficiencies, and may experience operational difficulties,    increased costs (including energy and transportation),    manufacturing interruptions or delays, inefficiencies in the    structure    and/or    operation of its supply chain, loss of its intellectual property    rights, quality issues, increased product    time-to-marketand/or    inefficient allocation of human resources, any or all of which    could materially and adversely affect Applieds business,    financial condition and results of operations. The    ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital    to Applieds success.     Applieds success and competitiveness depend in large part    on its ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees.    Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors,    including fluctuations in global economic and industry    conditions, changes in Applieds management or leadership,    competitors hiring practices, cost reduction activities    (including workforce reductions, unpaid shutdowns and salary    reductions), and the effectiveness of Applieds    compensation and benefit programs, including its equity-based    programs. Applied periodically evaluates its overall    compensation program and makes adjustments, as appropriate, to    enhance its competitiveness. If Applied does not successfully    attract, retain and motivate key employees, Applied may be    unable to capitalize on its opportunities and its operating    results may be materially and adversely affected. Changes    in tax rates or tax assets and liabilities could affect results    of operations.     As a global company, Applied is subject to taxation in the    United States and various other countries. Significant judgment    is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities.    Applieds future annual and quarterly tax rates could be    affected by numerous factors, including changes in the:    (1) applicable tax laws; (2) amount and composition of    pre-tax income in countries with differing tax rates; or    (3) valuation of Applieds deferred tax assets and    liabilities. In addition, Applied is subject to regular    examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax    authorities, and from time to time initiates amendments to    previously filed tax returns. Applied regularly assesses the    likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from    these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of    its provision for income taxes. Although Applied believes its    tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the    tax authorities will agree with such estimates. Applied may have    to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the    estimates, which may be time-consuming and expensive. There can    be no assurance that Applied will be successful or that any    final determination will not be materially different from the    treatment reflected in Applieds historical income tax    provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely    affect Applieds financial condition and results of    operations. Applied    is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or    claims and protection of intellectual property    rights.     Applied from time to time is, and in the future may be, involved    in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement,    intellectual property rights, antitrust, environmental    regulations, securities, contracts, product performance, product    liability, unfair competition, employment and other matters. In    addition, Applied on occasion receives notification from    customers who believe that Applied owes them indemnification or    other obligations related to claims made against such customers    by third parties. These legal proceedings and claims, whether    with or without merit, may be time-consuming and expensive to    prosecute or defend, divert managements attention and    resources,    and/or    inhibit Applieds ability to sell its products. There can    be no assurance regarding the outcome of    22Table of Contents    current or future legal proceedings or claims. Applied    previously entered into a mutual covenant-not-to-sue arrangement    with one of its competitors to decrease the risk of patent    infringement lawsuits in the future. There can be no assurance    that the intended results of this arrangement will be achieved    or that Applied will be able to adequately protect its    intellectual property rights with the restrictions associated    with such a covenant. In addition, Applieds success    depends in significant part on the protection of its    intellectual property and other rights. Infringement of    Applieds rights by a third party, such as the unauthorized    manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts, could result in    uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for Applied.    Applieds intellectual property rights may not provide    significant competitive advantages if they are circumvented,    invalidated, rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of    technological change, or if Applied does not adequately protect    or assert these rights. Furthermore, the laws and practices of    other countries, including China, India, Taiwan and Korea,    permit the protection and enforcement of Applieds rights    to varying extents, which may not be sufficient to protect    Applieds rights. If Applied is not able to obtain or    enforce intellectual property rights, resolve or settle claims,    obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms,    and/or    successfully prosecute or defend its intellectual property    position, Applieds business, financial condition and    results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Applied    is subject to risks of non-compliance with environmental and    safety regulations.     Applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in    connection with its global business operations, including but    not limited to: regulations related to the development,    manufacture and use of its products; recycling and disposal of    materials used in its products or in producing its products; the    operation of its facilities; and the use of its real property.    The failure or inability to comply with existing or future    environmental and safety regulations could result in:    (1) significant remediation liabilities; (2) the    imposition of fines; (3) the suspension or termination of    the development, manufacture, sale or use of certain of its    products; (4) limitations on the operation of its    facilities or ability to use its real property;    and/or    (5) a decrease in the value of its real property, each of    which could have a material adverse effect on Applieds    business, financial condition and results of operations. Applied    is exposed to various risks related to the regulatory    environment.     Applied is subject to various risks related to: (1) new,    different, inconsistent or even conflicting laws, rules and    regulations that may be enacted by legislative bodies    and/or    regulatory agencies in the countries in which Applied operates;    (2) disagreements or disputes between national or regional    regulatory agencies related to international trade; and    (3) the interpretation and application of laws, rules and    regulations. If Applied is found by a court or regulatory agency    not to be in compliance with applicable laws, rules or    regulations, Applieds business, financial condition and    results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Applied    is subject to internal control evaluations and attestation    requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley    Act.     Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,    Applied must include in its Annual Report on    Form 10-K    a report of management on the effectiveness of Applieds    internal control over financial reporting. Ongoing compliance    with this requirement is complex, costly and time-consuming. If    Applied fails to maintain effective internal control over    financial reporting or Applieds management does not timely    assess the adequacy of such internal control, Applied could be    subject to regulatory sanctions and the publics perception    of Applied may decline. "
4,AMAT,APPLIED MATERIALS INC,2008-12-12,">Item 1A:  Risk    Factors     The following factors could materially affect Applieds    business, financial condition or results of operations and    should be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its    business, in addition to other information presented elsewhere    in this report. The    industries that Applied serves are volatile and    unpredictable.     As a supplier to the global semiconductor, flat panel display,    solar and related industries, Applied is subject to business    cycles, the timing, length and volatility of which can be    difficult to predict and which vary by reportable segment. These    industries historically have been cyclical due to sudden changes    in customers manufacturing capacity requirements and    spending, which depend in part on capacity utilization, demand    for customers products, inventory levels relative to    demand, and access to affordable capital. These changes have    affected the timing and amounts of customers purchases and    investments in technology, and continue to affect Applieds    orders, net sales, operating expenses and net income.     To meet rapidly changing demand in each of the industries it    serves, Applied must effectively manage its resources and    production capacity for each of its segments and across multiple    segments. During periods of decreasing demand for Applieds    products, Applied must be able to appropriately align its cost    structure with prevailing market conditions; effectively manage    its supply chain; and motivate and retain key employees. During    periods of increasing demand, Applied must have sufficient    manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer    13Table of Contents    demand; effectively manage its supply chain; and attract, retain    and motivate a sufficient number of qualified individuals. If    Applied is not able to timely and appropriately adapt to changes    in its business environment, Applieds business, financial    condition or results of operations may be materially and    adversely affected. Applied    is exposed to risks associated with the ongoing financial crisis    and weakening global economy.     The recent severe tightening of the credit markets, turmoil in    the financial markets, and weakening global economy are    contributing to slowdowns in the industries in which Applied    operates, which slowdowns are expected to worsen if these    economic conditions are prolonged or deteriorate further. The    markets for semiconductors and flat panel displays in particular    depend largely on consumer spending. Economic uncertainty    exacerbates negative trends in consumer spending and may cause    certain Applied customers to push out, cancel, or refrain from    placing equipment or service orders, which may affect    Applieds ability to convert backlog to sales and reduce    net sales. Difficulties in obtaining capital and deteriorating    market conditions may also lead to the inability of some    customers to obtain affordable financing, resulting in lower    sales for Applied. Customers with liquidity issues may lead to    additional bad debt expense for Applied. These conditions may    also similarly affect key suppliers, which could affect their    ability to deliver parts and result in delays for Applieds    products. Further, these conditions and uncertainty about future    economic conditions make it challenging for Applied to forecast    its operating results, make business decisions, and identify the    risks that may affect its business, financial condition and    results of operations. In addition, Applied maintains an    investment portfolio that is subject to general credit,    liquidity, market and interest rate risks that may be    exacerbated by deteriorating financial market conditions and, as    a result, the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio    could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment. If Applied    is not able to timely and appropriately adapt to changes    resulting from the difficult macroeconomic environment,    Applieds business, financial condition or results of    operations may be materially and adversely affected. Applied    is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the    various industries in which it operates.     The global semiconductor, flat panel display, solar and related    industries in which Applied operates are characterized by    ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries,    including:           increasing capital requirements for building and operating new    fabrication plants and the resulting effect on customers    ability to raise the necessary capital;           the varying growth rates of the semiconductor, display and solar    equipment industries;           the increasing cost and complexity for customers to move from    product design to volume manufacturing and the resulting impact    on new technology adoption rates;           the importance of reducing the total cost of system ownership,    due in part to the increasing significance of lower-cost    consumer electronics as a driver for semiconductor and LCD    demand;           fluctuating levels of business information technology spending;           the heightened importance to customers of system reliability and    productivity and the effect on demand for systems as a result of    their increasing productivity, device yield and reliability;           demand for shorter cycle times for the development, manufacture    and installation of manufacturing equipment;           price and performance trends for semiconductor devices, LCDs and    solar PVs, and the corresponding effect on demand for such    products;           the increasing importance of spare parts availability to    maximize system uptime;           the increasing role for and complexity of software; and           the increasing focus on energy usage, the environment and    sustainability.     If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from    the ongoing changes occurring in the semiconductor, flat panel    display, solar and related industries, its business, financial    condition and results of operations could be materially and    adversely affected.    14Table of ContentsApplied    is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to    the semiconductor industry.     The largest portion of Applieds revenues historically has    come from sales of manufacturing equipment to the global    semiconductor industry, and this business historically has also    been the most profitable. Changes in the semiconductor industry    may lead to a decrease in the percentage of Applieds    revenue attributable to its semiconductor equipment business as    a percentage of overall revenue, which in turn can negatively    impact the Companys net income. In addition to the general    industry changes described in the preceding risk factor, the    semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes    particular to that industry, including:           the increasing cost of semiconductor R&D due to many    factors, including decreasing linewidths, the increasing number    of materials, device structures, applications and process steps,    and the increasing cost, complexity and integration of    manufacturing process development and chip design;           the growing types and varieties of semiconductors and expanding    number of applications across multiple substrate sizes,    resulting in divergent technical demands;           differing rates of market growth for, and capital investments    by, various semiconductor device makers, such as memory    (including NAND flash and DRAM), logic and foundry;           the increasing cost and complexity for semiconductor    manufacturers to move volume manufacturing from one technology    node to the next smaller technology node, and the resulting    impact on the technology transition rate and the rate of    investment in capital equipment;           the effect of the decreasing number of new chip designs on the    rate of capital equipment investment;           technology changes in related markets, such as lithography;           the increasing fragmentation of certain markets for    semiconductors and the resulting effect on the number of    individual markets that have the ability to financially justify    the cost of a new fabrication plant;           the cost, technical complexity and timing of a proposed    transition from 300 mm to 450 mm wafers; and           increasing costs, complexity and competitiveness in the    semiconductor industry that has resulted in the decreasing    profitability of many manufacturers, causing them to enter into    collaboration, cooperation or cost-sharing arrangements with    other manufacturers, to outsource some or all manufacturing    activities, or to focus on particular markets or applications.     If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from    the ongoing changes occurring in the semiconductor industry, its    business, financial condition and results of operations could be    materially and adversely affected. Applied    is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to    the flat panel display industry.     The global flat panel display industry historically has    experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment    investment levels, due in part to the limited number of LCD    manufacturers and the concentrated nature of LCD end-use    applications. Recently, industry growth has depended to a    considerable extent on consumer demand for increasingly larger    and more advanced TVs. In addition to the general industry    changes described above in the third risk factor, the display    industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to that    industry. These include technical and financial difficulties    associated with transitioning to larger substrate sizes for    LCDs, as well as the effect of a slowing rate of transition to    larger substrate sizes on capital intensity and product    differentiation. If Applied does not successfully manage the    risks resulting from the ongoing changes occurring in the    display industry, its business, financial condition and results    of operations could be materially and adversely affected.    15Table of ContentsApplied    is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to    the solar industry.     An increasing portion of Applieds business is in the    emerging solar market, which Applied entered in 2006 and which,    in addition to the general industry changes described above in    the third risk factor, is characterized by ongoing changes    particular to the solar industry, including:           changes in demand for solar PV products arising from, among    other things, the cost and performance of solar PV technology    compared to other energy sources;           the adequacy of or changes in government energy policies,    including the availability and amount of government incentives    for solar power;           the extent of investment or participation in solar by utilities    or other companies that generate, transmit or distribute power    to end users;           evolving industry standards;           difficulties associated with establishing a standard form factor    for thin film solar modules;           regulatory requirements and customers ability to timely    satisfy these requirements;           a requirement of certification by third parties in certain    circumstances;           customers and end-users access to affordable    financial capital; and           the move to increasingly greater factory output of solar PVs,    including output on a level sufficient to annually generate    electricity on a gigawatt scale.     If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from    the ongoing changes occurring in the solar industry, its    business, financial condition and results of operations could be    materially and adversely affected. Applied    must adapt its business and product offerings to respond to    competition and rapid technological changes.     As Applied operates in a highly competitive environment, its    future success depends on many factors, including the effective    commercialization and customer acceptance of its    nanomanufacturing technology equipment, service and related    products. In addition, Applied must successfully execute its    growth strategy, including enhancing market share in existing    markets, expanding into related markets, cultivating new markets    and exceeding industry growth rates, while constantly improving    its operational performance. The development, introduction and    support of a broadening set of products in more varied    competitive environments have grown increasingly complex and    expensive over time. Furthermore, new or improved products may    involve higher costs and reduced profits. Applieds success    is subject to many risks, including but not limited to its    ability to timely, cost-effectively and successfully:           develop new products, improve    and/or    develop new applications for existing products, and adapt    similar products for use by customers in different applications    and/or    markets with varying technical requirements;           appropriately price and achieve market acceptance of products;           differentiate its products from those of competitors and any    disruptive technologies, meet performance specifications, and    drive efficiencies and cost reductions;           maintain operating flexibility to enable different responses to    different markets, customers and applications;           appropriately allocate resources, including R&D funding,    among Applieds products and between the development of new    products and the enhancement of existing products;           accurately forecast demand and meet production schedules for its    products;           improve its manufacturing processes and achieve cost    efficiencies across product offerings;           adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different    parts of the supply chain;           qualify products for volume manufacturing with its customers;    16Table of Contents           implement changes in its design engineering methodology,    including those that enable reduction of material costs and    cycle time, greater commonality of platforms and types of parts    used in different systems, greater effectiveness of product life    cycle management, and reduced energy usage and environmental    impact; and           successfully accomplish the simultaneous    start-up of    multiple integrated thin film solar production lines.     If Applied does not successfully manage these challenges, its    business, financial condition and results of operations could be    materially and adversely affected. The    entry into new markets and industries entails additional    challenges.     As part of its growth strategy, Applied must successfully expand    into related or new markets and industries, either with its    existing nanomanufacturing technology products or with new    products developed internally or obtained through acquisitions.    The entry into different markets involves additional challenges,    including those arising from:           Applieds ability to anticipate demand, capitalize on    opportunities, and avoid or minimize risks;           the complexity of managing multiple businesses with variations    in production planning, execution, supply chain management and    logistics;           the adoption of new business models, such as the supply of an    integrated production line consisting of a suite of Applied and    non-Applied equipment to manufacture solar PVs;           the need to develop adequate new business processes and systems;           Applieds ability to rapidly expand its operations to meet    increased demand and the associated effect on Applieds    working capital;           new materials, processes and technologies;           the need to attract, motivate and retain employees with skills    and expertise in these new areas;           new and more diverse customers and suppliers, including some    with limited operating histories, uncertain    and/or    limited funding, evolving business models    and/or    locations in regions where Applied does not have existing    operations;           different customer service requirements;           new and/or    different competitors with potentially more financial or other    resources and industry experience;           entry into new industries and countries, with differing levels    of government involvement, laws and regulations, and business    and employment practices;           third parties intellectual property rights; and           the need to comply with, or work to establish, industry    standards and practices.     If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from    its entry into new markets and industries, its business,    financial condition and results of operations could be    materially and adversely affected. Applied    is exposed to the risks of operating a global    business.     In fiscal 2008, approximately 81 percent of Applieds    net sales were to customers in regions outside the    United States, with a majority of business from customers    in Asia. Certain of Applieds R&D    and/or    manufacturing facilities, as well as suppliers to Applied, are    also located outside the United States, including in China. The    global nature of Applieds business and operations presents    challenges, including but not limited to those arising from:           varying regional and geopolitical business conditions and    demands;           variations among, and changes in, local, regional, national or    international laws and regulations (including tax and import and    export restrictions), as well as the interpretation and    application of such laws and regulations;           global trade issues, including those related to the    interpretation and application of import and export licenses;           variations in protection of intellectual property and other    legal rights;    17Table of Contents           positions taken by U.S. governmental agencies regarding    possible national commercial    and/or    security issues posed by international business operations;           fluctuating raw material and energy costs;           variations in the ability to develop relationships with    suppliers and other local businesses;           fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates,    including the relative position of the U.S. dollar;           the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in    different locations;           political instability, natural disasters (such as earthquakes,    floods or storms), pandemics, terrorism or acts of war in    locations where Applied has operations, suppliers or sales;           cultural differences;           customer- or government-supported efforts to promote the    development and growth of local competitors;           shipping costs    and/or    delays;           uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various    countries; and           uncertainties with respect to growth rates for the manufacture    and sales of semiconductors, LCDs and solar cells in the    developing economies of certain countries.     Many of these challenges are present in China, which is    experiencing significant growth of both suppliers and    competitors to Applied, and which Applied believes presents a    large potential market for its products and opportunity for    growth over the long term. In addition, Applied must regularly    reassess the size, capability and location of its global    infrastructure and make appropriate changes. These challenges    may materially and adversely affect Applieds business,    financial condition and results of operations. Applied    is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated    customer base.     Applieds semiconductor and flat panel display customer    bases historically have been, and are becoming even more, highly    concentrated. In addition, certain customers have entered into    strategic alliances or industry consortia that have increased    the influence of key industry participants in technology    decisions made by their partners. In the solar area, while the    number of solar PV manufacturing customers is increasing as the    number of market entrants grows, the size of contracts with    particular customers is expected to rise substantially as the    industry moves to greater solar module factory output capacity,    including capacity sufficient to annually generate electricity    on a gigawatt scale. In this environment, contracts or orders    from a relatively limited number of semiconductor, display and    solar manufacturers have accounted for, and are expected to    continue to account for, a substantial portion of Applieds    business. In addition, the mix and type of customers, and sales    to any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to    quarter and from year to year. If customers do not place orders,    or they delay or cancel orders, Applied may not be able to    replace the business. As Applieds products are configured    to customer specifications, changing, rescheduling or canceling    orders may result in significant, non-recoverable costs. Major    customers may also seek, and on occasion receive, pricing,    payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial    terms that are less favorable to Applied. In addition, certain    customers have undergone significant ownership    and/or    management changes, and outsourced manufacturing activities,    have engaged in collaboration or cooperation arrangements with    other customers or have consolidated with other customers, which    may result in additional complexities in managing customer    relationships and transactions. These factors could have a    material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial    condition and results of operations. Applied    is exposed to risks associated with acquisitions and strategic    investments.     Applied has made, and in the future intends to make,    acquisitions of, and investments in, companies, technologies or    products in existing, related or new markets for Applied.    Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including but not limited    to:           diversion of managements attention from other operational    matters;           inability to complete acquisitions as anticipated or at all;    18Table of Contents           inability to realize anticipated benefits;           failure to commercialize purchased technologies;           inability to capitalize on characteristics of new markets that    may be significantly different from Applieds existing    markets and where competitors may have stronger market positions;           exposure to operational risks, rules and regulations to the    extent such activities are located in countries where Applied    has not historically conducted business;           challenges associated with managing larger, more diverse and    more widespread operations;           inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in    key technologies;           ineffectiveness of an acquired companys internal controls;           impairment of acquired intangible assets as a result of    technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of    the acquired company or its product offerings;           unknown, underestimated    and/or    undisclosed commitments or liabilities;           inappropriate scale of acquired entities critical    resources or facilities for business needs; and           ineffective integration of operations, systems, technologies,    products or employees of the acquired companies.     Applied also makes strategic investments in other companies,    including companies formed as joint ventures, which may decline    in value    and/or not    meet desired objectives. The success of these investments    depends on various factors over which Applied may have limited    or no control and, particularly with respect to joint ventures,    requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic    partners. Mergers and acquisitions and strategic investments are    inherently subject to significant risks, and the inability to    effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely    affect Applieds business, financial condition and results    of operations. Manufacturing    interruptions or delays could affect Applieds ability to    meet customer demand, while the failure to estimate customer    demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete    inventory.     Applieds business depends on its ability to supply    equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly    changing technical and volume requirements of its customers,    which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts,    components and subassemblies (collectively, parts) from    suppliers. Some key parts may be subject to long lead-times    and/or    obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of    suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by    suppliers located in countries other than the United States,    including China. Applied may experience significant    interruptions of its manufacturing operations, delays in its    ability to deliver products or services, increased costs or    customer order cancellations as a result of:           the failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver quality    parts;           volatility in the availability and cost of materials;           difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export    approvals;           information technology or infrastructure failures;           natural disasters (such as earthquakes, floods or    storms); or           other causes (such as regional economic downturns, pandemics,    political instability, terrorism, or acts of war), could result    in delayed deliveries, manufacturing inefficiencies, increased    costs or order cancellations.     In addition, Applieds need to rapidly increase its    business and manufacturing capacity to meet unanticipated    increases in demand may exacerbate any interruptions in    Applieds manufacturing operations and supply chain and the    associated effect on Applieds working capital. Moreover,    if actual demand for Applieds products is different than    expected, Applied may purchase more/fewer parts than necessary    or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery    of parts. The volatility of demand for capital equipment    increases capital, technical and other risks for companies in    the supply chain. Any or all of these factors could materially    and adversely affect Applieds business, financial    condition and results of operations.    19Table of ContentsThe    failure to successfully implement and conduct off-shoring and    outsourcing activities and other operational initiatives could    adversely affect results of operations.     To better align its costs with market conditions, increase its    presence in growing markets, enhance productivity, and improve    efficiencies, Applied conducts engineering, software development    and other operations in regions outside the United States,    particularly India and China, and outsources certain functions    to third parties, including companies in the United States,    India, China and other countries. Outsourced functions include    certain engineering, manufacturing, customer support, software    development, information technology support, finance and    administrative activities. The expanding role of third party    providers has required changes to Applieds existing    operations and the adoption of new procedures and processes for    retaining and managing these providers in order to realize the    potential productivity and operational efficiencies, assure    quality and continuity of supply, and protect Applieds    intellectual property. In addition, Applied has implemented    several key operational initiatives intended to improve    manufacturing efficiency, including integrate-to-order,    module-final-test and    merge-in-transit    programs. Applied also is implementing a multi-year,    company-wide program to transform certain business processes,    which includes transitioning to a single enterprise resource    planning (ERP) software system to perform various functions. The    conversion to this new ERP system will include certain risks,    including difficulties with data integrity and business    interruption.     If Applied does not effectively develop and implement its    off-shoring and outsourcing strategies, if required export and    other governmental approvals are not timely obtained, if    Applieds third party providers do not perform as    anticipated, or if there are delays or difficulties in    implementing a new ERP system or enhancing business processes,    Applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or    cost efficiencies, and may experience operational difficulties,    increased costs (including energy and transportation),    manufacturing interruptions or delays, inefficiencies in the    structure    and/or    operation of its supply chain, loss of its intellectual property    rights, quality issues, increased product time-to-market    and/or    inefficient allocation of human resources, any or all of which    could materially and adversely affect Applieds business,    financial condition and results of operations. The    ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital    to Applieds success.     Applieds success and competitiveness depend in large part    on its ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees.    Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors,    including fluctuations in global economic and industry    conditions, changes in Applieds management or leadership,    competitors hiring practices, cost reduction activities,    and the effectiveness of Applieds compensation programs,    including its equity-based programs. Applied periodically    evaluates its overall compensation program and makes    adjustments, as appropriate, to enhance its competitiveness. If    Applied does not successfully attract, retain and motivate key    employees, Applied may be unable to capitalize on its    opportunities and its operating results may be materially and    adversely affected. Changes    in tax rates or tax liabilities could affect results of    operations.     As a global company, Applied is subject to taxation in the    United States and various other countries. Significant judgment    is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities.    Applieds future annual and quarterly tax rates could be    affected by numerous factors, including changes in the:    (1) applicable tax laws; (2) composition of pre-tax    income in countries with differing tax rates; or    (3) valuation of Applieds deferred tax assets and    liabilities. In addition, Applied is subject to regular    examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax    authorities. Applied regularly assesses the likelihood of    favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these    examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for    income taxes. Although Applied believes its tax estimates are    reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final    determination will not be materially different from the    treatment reflected in Applieds historical income tax    provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely    affect Applieds financial condition and results of    operations. Applied    is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or    claims and protection of intellectual property    rights.     Applied from time to time is, and in the future may be, involved    in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement,    intellectual property rights, antitrust, environmental    regulations, securities, contracts, product    20Table of Contents    performance, product liability, unfair competition, employment    and other matters. In addition, Applied on occasion receives    notification from customers who believe that Applied owes them    indemnification or other obligations related to claims made    against customers by third parties. These legal proceedings and    claims, whether with or without merit, may be time-consuming and    expensive to prosecute or defend, divert managements    attention and resources,    and/or    inhibit Applieds ability to sell its products. There can    be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal    proceedings or claims. Applied previously entered into a mutual    covenant-not-to-sue arrangement with one of its competitors to    decrease the risk of patent infringement lawsuits in the future.    There can be no assurance that the intended results of this    arrangement will be achieved or that Applied will be able to    adequately protect its intellectual property rights with the    restrictions associated with such a covenant. In addition,    Applieds success depends in significant part on the    protection of its intellectual property and other rights.    Infringement of Applieds rights by a third party, such as    the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare    parts, could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue    opportunities for Applied. Applieds intellectual property    rights may not provide significant competitive advantages if    they are circumvented, invalidated, rendered obsolete by the    rapid pace of technological change, or if Applied does not    adequately protect or assert these rights. Furthermore, the laws    and practices of other countries, including China, India, Taiwan    and Korea, permit the protection and enforcement of    Applieds rights to varying extents, which may not be    sufficient to protect Applieds rights. If Applied is not    able to obtain or enforce intellectual property rights, resolve    or settle claims, obtain necessary licenses on commercially    reasonable terms,    and/or    successfully prosecute or defend its intellectual property    position, Applieds business, financial condition and    results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Applied    is subject to risks of non-compliance with environmental and    safety regulations.     Applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in    connection with its global business operations, including but    not limited to: regulations related to the development,    manufacture and use of its products; recycling and disposal of    materials used in its products or in producing its products; the    operation of its facilities; and the use of its real property.    The failure or inability to comply with existing or future    environmental and safety regulations could result in:    (1) significant remediation liabilities; (2) the    imposition of fines; (3) the suspension or termination of    the development, manufacture, sale or use of certain of its    products; (4) limitations on the operation of its    facilities or ability to use its real property;    and/or    (5) a decrease in the value of its real property, each of    which could have a material adverse effect on Applieds    business, financial condition and results of operations. Applied    is exposed to various risks related to the regulatory    environment.     Applied is subject to various risks related to: (1) new,    different, inconsistent or even conflicting laws, rules and    regulations that may be enacted by legislative bodies    and/or    regulatory agencies in the countries in which Applied operates;    (2) disagreements or disputes between national or regional    regulatory agencies related to international trade; and    (3) the interpretation and application of laws, rules and    regulations. If Applied is found by a court or regulatory agency    not to be in compliance with applicable laws, rules or    regulations, Applieds business, financial condition and    results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Applied    is subject to internal control evaluations and attestation    requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley    Act.     Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,    Applied must include in its Annual Report on    Form 10-K    a report of management on the effectiveness of Applieds    internal control over financial reporting. Ongoing compliance    with this requirement is complex, costly and time-consuming. If    Applied fails to maintain effective internal control over    financial reporting or Applieds management does not timely    assess the adequacy of such internal control, Applied could be    subject to regulatory sanctions and the publics perception    of Applied may decline.    21Table of Contents"
0,AMAT,APPLIED MATERIALS INC,2007-12-14,">Item 1A:  Risk    Factors     The following factors could materially affect Applieds    business, financial condition or results of operations and    should be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its    business, in addition to other information presented elsewhere    in this report. The    industries that Applied serves are volatile and    unpredictable.     As a supplier to the global semiconductor, flat panel display,    solar and related industries, Applied is subject to business    cycles, the timing, length and volatility of which can be    difficult to predict and which may vary by reportable segment.    The industries have historically been cyclical due to sudden    changes in customers manufacturing capacity requirements    and spending, which depend in part on capacity utilization,    demand for customers products, and inventory levels    relative to demand. The effects on Applied of these changes in    demand, including end-customer demand, are occurring more    rapidly. These changes have affected the timing and amounts of    customers purchases and investments in technology, and    continue to affect Applieds orders, net sales, gross    margin, contributed profit and results of operations.     Applied must effectively manage its resources and production    capacity to meet rapidly changing demand. During periods of    decreasing demand Applieds products, Applied must be able    to appropriately align its cost structure with prevailing market    conditions, motivate and retain key employees, and effectively    manage its supply chain. During periods of increasing demand,    Applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and    inventory to meet customer demand; attract, retain and motivate    a sufficient number of qualified individuals; and effectively    manage its supply chain. If Applied is not able to timely and    appropriately adapt to changes in industry cycles,    Applieds business, financial condition or results of    operations may be materially and adversely affected. Applied    is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the    semiconductor and    semiconductor-related    industries.     The global industries in which Applied operates are    characterized by ongoing changes, including: (1) higher    capital requirements for building and operating new    semiconductor and LCD fabrication plants and the resulting    effect on customers ability to raise the necessary    capital; (2) differing rates of market growth for, and    capital investments by, various semiconductor device makers,    such as memory (including NAND Flash and DRAM), logic and    foundry, as well as LCD and solar manufacturers;    (3) industry growth rates; (4) the increasing cost and    decreasing affordability of research and development due to many    factors, including decreasing linewidths, the increasing number    of materials, applications and process steps, and the greater    complexity of process development and chip design; (5) the    increasing difficulty for customers to move from product design    to volume manufacturing; (6) the importance of reducing the    cost of system ownership, due in part to the increasing    significance of consumer electronics as a driver for    semiconductor and LCD demand and the related focus on lower    prices; (7) varying levels of business information    technology spending; (8) the heightened importance to    customers of system reliability and productivity, and the effect    on demand for systems as a result of their increasing    productivity, device yield and reliability; (9) the growing    types and varieties of semiconductors and expanding number of    applications across multiple substrate sizes, resulting in    customers divergent technical demands; (10) demand    for shorter cycle times for the development, manufacture and    installation of manufacturing equipment; (11) the challenge    to semiconductor manufacturers of moving volume manufacturing    from one technology node to the next smaller technology node,    and the resulting impact on the technology transition rate and    the rate of investment in capital equipment; (12) price    trends for certain semiconductor devices and LCDs;    (13) difficulties associated with transitioning to larger    substrate sizes; and (14) the increasing importance of the    availability of spare parts to assure maximum system uptime. If    Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from    the ongoing changes occurring in the semiconductor and    semiconductor-related industries, its business, financial    condition and results of operations could be materially and    adversely affected.    13Table of ContentsApplied    must adapt its business and product offerings to respond to    competition and rapid technological changes.     As Applied operates in a highly competitive environment, its    future success depends on many factors, including the effective    development, commercialization and customer acceptance of its    nanomanufacturing technology equipment, service and related    products. In addition, Applied must successfully execute its    growth strategy, including enhancing market share in existing    markets, expanding into related markets, and cultivating new    markets, while constantly improving its operational performance.    The development, introduction and support of a broadening set of    products in more varied competitive environments have grown    increasingly complex and expensive over time. Applieds    success is subject to many risks, including but not limited to    its ability to timely, cost-effectively and successfully:    (1) improve    and/or    develop new applications for existing products, adapt similar    products for use by customers in different applications    and/or    markets with varying technical requirements, and develop new    products; (2) appropriately price and achieve market    acceptance of products; (3) maintain operating flexibility    to enable different responses to different markets, customers    and applications; (4) appropriately allocate resources,    including RD&E funding, among Applieds products and    between the development of new products and the improvement of    existing products; (5) accurately forecast demand and meet    production schedules for its products; (6) achieve cost    efficiencies across product offerings; (7) increase market    share in existing markets, expand its markets and exceed the    industry growth rate; (8) adapt to technology changes in    related markets, such as lithography; (9) adapt to changes    in value offered by companies in different parts of the supply    chain; (10) qualify products for volume manufacturing with    its customers; (11) implement changes in its design    engineering methodology, including those that enable significant    decreases in material costs and cycle time, greater commonality    of platforms and types of parts used in different systems, and    greater effectiveness of product life cycle management; and    (12) improve its manufacturing processes. Furthermore, new    or improved products may involve higher costs and reduced    margins. If Applied does not successfully manage these    challenges, its business, financial condition and results of    operations could be materially and adversely affected. The    entry into new markets and industries entails additional    challenges.     As part of its growth strategy, Applied must successfully expand    into related or new markets and industries, either with its    existing nanomanufacturing technology products or with new    products developed internally or obtained through acquisitions.    These include the emerging solar market, which Applied entered    in 2006 and which is subject to ongoing changes in demand for    photovoltaic (PV) products arising from, among other things,    fluctuations in the cost of electric power, availability of    government incentives, changes in government energy policies,    the performance and reliability of PV technology, and the    success of other renewable energy sources. The entry into    different markets involves additional challenges, including    those arising from: (1) Applieds ability to    anticipate demand and capitalize on opportunities, and avoid or    minimize risks; (2) new customers and suppliers, including    some with limited operating histories, uncertain    and/or    limited funding,    and/or    locations in regions where Applied does not have existing    operations; (3) the adoption of new business models, such    as the supply of a suite of Applied and non-Applied equipment    sufficient to manufacture solar cells; (4) difficulties in    production planning and execution; (5) new materials,    processes and technologies; (6) Applieds ability to    drive efficiencies and cost reductions; (7) the need to    attract, motivate and retain employees with skills and expertise    in these new areas; (8) different service requirements; and    (9) intellectual property rights of others. If Applied does    not successfully manage the risks resulting from entry into new    markets and industries, its business, financial condition and    results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Applied    is exposed to the risks of operating a global    business.     In fiscal 2007, approximately 84 percent of Applieds    net sales were to customers in regions outside the    United States. A rising percentage of Applieds    business is from customers in Asia. Certain of Applieds    RD&E    and/or    manufacturing facilities, as well as suppliers to Applied, are    also located outside the United States, including in China.    Managing Applieds global operations presents challenges,    including but not limited to, those arising from:    (1) global uncertainties with respect to economic growth    rates in various countries; (2) varying regional and    geopolitical business conditions and demands; (3) global    trade issues; (4) variations in protection of intellectual    property and other legal rights in different countries;    (5) concerns of U.S. governmental agencies regarding    possible    14Table of Contents    national commercial    and/or    security issues posed by the growing manufacturing business in    Asia; (6) fluctuating raw material and energy costs;    (7) variations in the ability to develop relationships with    suppliers and other local businesses; (8) changes in laws    and regulations of the United States (including export    restrictions) and other countries, as well as their    interpretation and application; (9) fluctuations in    interest rates and currency exchange rates, including the    weakening relative position of the U.S. dollar;    (10) the need to provide sufficient levels of technical    support in different locations; (11) political instability,    natural disasters (such as earthquakes, floods or storms),    pandemics, terrorism or acts of war in locations where Applied    has operations, suppliers or sales; (12) cultural    differences; (13) special customer- or government-supported    efforts to promote the development and growth of local    competitors; (14) shipping costs    and/or    delays; and (15) adverse conditions in credit markets. Many    of these challenges are present in China, which is experiencing    significant growth of both suppliers and competitors to Applied,    and which Applied believes presents a large potential market for    its products and opportunity for growth over the long term. In    addition, Applied must regularly reassess the size, capability    and location of its global infrastructure and make appropriate    changes. These challenges may materially and adversely affect    Applieds business, financial condition and results of    operations. Applied    is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated    customer base in the semiconductor and flat panel display    industries.     Applieds semiconductor and flat panel display customer    base historically has been, and is becoming even more, highly    concentrated. Orders from a relatively limited number of    manufacturers have accounted for, and are expected to continue    to account for, a substantial portion of Applieds net    sales. In addition, the mix and type of customers, and sales to    any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to    quarter and from year to year. If customers do not place orders,    or they delay or cancel orders, Applied may not be able to    replace the business. As Applieds products are configured    to customer specifications, changing, rescheduling or canceling    orders may result in significant, non-recoverable costs. Major    customers may also seek, and on occasion receive, pricing,    payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial    terms that are less favorable to Applied. In addition, certain    customers have undergone significant ownership changes, have    outsourced manufacturing activities,    and/or have    entered into strategic alliances or industry consortia that have    increased the influence of key semiconductor manufacturers in    technology decisions made by their partners, which may result in    additional complexities in managing customer relationships and    transactions. These factors could have a material, adverse    effect on Applieds business, financial condition and    results of operations. Applied    is exposed to risks associated with acquisitions and strategic    investments.     Applied has made, and in the future intends to make,    acquisitions of, and investments in, companies, technologies or    products in existing, related or new markets for Applied.    Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including but not limited    to: (1) diversion of managements attention from other    operational matters; (2) inability to complete acquisitions    as anticipated or at all; (3) inability to realize    anticipated benefits; (4) failure to commercialize    purchased technologies; (5) inability to capitalize on    characteristics of new markets that may be significantly    different from Applieds existing markets;    (6) exposure to operational risks, rules and regulations to    the extent such activities are located in countries where    Applied has not historically done business; (7) inability    to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key    technologies; (8) ineffectiveness of an acquired    companys internal controls; (9) impairment of    acquired intangible assets as a result of technological    advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the acquired    company or its product offerings; (10) unknown,    underestimated    and/or    undisclosed commitments or liabilities; (11) excess or    underutilized facilities; and (12) ineffective integration    of operations, technologies, products or employees of the    acquired companies. Applied also makes strategic investments in    other companies, including companies formed as joint ventures,    which may decline in value    and/or not    meet desired objectives. The success of these investments    depends on various factors over which Applied may have limited    or no control and, particularly with respect to joint ventures,    requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic    partners. Mergers and acquisitions and strategic investments are    inherently subject to significant risks, and the inability to    effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely    affect Applieds business, financial condition and results    of operations.    15Table of ContentsManufacturing    interruptions or delays could affect Applieds ability to    meet customer demand, while the failure to estimate customer    demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete    inventory.     Applieds business depends on its ability to supply    equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly    changing technical and volume requirements of its customers,    which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts,    components and subassemblies (collectively, parts) from    suppliers. Some key parts may be subject to long lead-times    and/or    obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of    suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by    suppliers in developing regions, including China. Significant    interruptions of manufacturing operations or the delivery of    services as a result of: (1) the failure or inability of    suppliers to timely deliver quality parts; (2) volatility    in the availability and cost of materials; (3) difficulties    or delays in obtaining required export approvals;    (4) information technology or infrastructure failures;    (5) natural disasters (such as earthquakes, floods or    storms); or (6) other causes (such as regional economic    downturns, pandemics, political instability, terrorism, or acts    of war), could result in delayed deliveries, manufacturing    inefficiencies, increased costs or order cancellations.    Moreover, if actual demand for Applieds products is    different than expected, Applied may purchase more/fewer parts    than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or    expediting delivery of parts. Any or all of these factors could    materially and adversely affect Applieds business,    financial condition and results of operations. The    failure to successfully implement and conduct offshoring and    outsourcing activities and other operational initiatives could    adversely affect results of operations.     To better align its costs with market conditions, increase its    presence in growing markets, improve its tax structure, and    enhance productivity and operational efficiency, Applied    conducts engineering, software development and other operations    in regions outside the United States, particularly India and    China, and outsources certain functions to third parties,    including companies in the United States, India, China and other    countries. Outsourced functions include certain engineering,    manufacturing, customer support, software development,    information technology support and administrative activities.    The expanding role of third party providers has required changes    to Applieds existing operations and the adoption of new    procedures and processes for retaining and managing these    providers in order to realize the potential productivity and    operational efficiencies, assure quality and protect    Applieds intellectual property. In addition, Applied has    implemented several key, operational initiatives intended to    improve manufacturing efficiency, including integrate-to-order,    module-final-test and    merge-in-transit    programs. Applied also is implementing a multi-year,    company-wide program to transform certain business processes,    which includes transitioning to a single-vendor, enterprise    resource planning (ERP) software system to perform various    functions. If Applied does not effectively develop and implement    its offshoring and outsourcing strategies, if required export    and other governmental approvals are not timely obtained, if    Applieds third party providers do not perform as    anticipated, or if there are delays or difficulties in    implementing a new ERP system or enhancing business processes,    Applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or    cost efficiencies, and may experience operational difficulties,    increased costs, manufacturing interruptions or delays, loss of    its intellectual property rights, quality issues, increased    product time-to-market    and/or    inefficient allocation of human resources, any or all of which    could materially and adversely affect Applieds business,    financial condition and results of operations. The    ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital    to Applieds success.     Applieds success and competitiveness depend in large part    on its ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees.    Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors,    including fluctuations in global economic and industry    conditions, changes in Applieds management or leadership,    competitors hiring practices, and the effectiveness of    Applieds compensation programs, including its equity-based    programs. Applied regularly evaluates its overall compensation    program and makes adjustments, as appropriate, to enhance its    competitiveness. If Applied does not successfully attract,    retain and motivate key employees, Applieds ability to    capitalize on its opportunities and its operating results may be    materially and adversely affected.    16Table of ContentsChanges    in tax rates or tax liabilities could affect results of    operations.     As a global company, Applied is subject to taxation in the    United States and various other countries. Significant judgment    is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities.    Applieds future annual and quarterly tax rates could be    affected by numerous factors, including changes in the:    (1) applicable tax laws; (2) composition of earnings    in countries with differing tax rates; or (3) valuation of    Applieds deferred tax assets and liabilities. In addition,    Applied is subject to regular examination of its income tax    returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax    authorities. Applied regularly assesses the likelihood of    favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these    examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for    income taxes. Although Applied believes its tax estimates are    reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final    determination will not be materially different from the    treatment reflected in Applieds historical income tax    provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely    affect Applieds results of operations. Applied    is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or    claims and protection of intellectual property    rights.     Applied from time to time is, and in the future may be, involved    in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement,    intellectual property rights, antitrust, environmental    regulations, securities, contracts, product performance, product    liability, unfair competition, employment and other matters. In    addition, Applied on occasion receives notification from    customers who believe that Applied owes them indemnification or    other obligations related to claims made against customers by    third parties. These legal proceedings and claims, whether with    or without merit, may be time-consuming and expensive to    prosecute or defend and also divert managements attention    and resources. There can be no assurance regarding the outcome    of current or future legal proceedings or claims. Applied    previously entered into a mutual covenant-not-to-sue arrangement    with one of its competitors to decrease the risk of patent    infringement lawsuits in the future. There can be no assurance    that the intended results of this arrangement will be achieved    or that Applied will be able to adequately protect its    intellectual property rights with the restrictions associated    with such a covenant. In addition, Applieds success    depends in significant part on the protection of its    intellectual property and other rights. Infringement of    Applieds rights by a third party, such as the unauthorized    manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts, could result in    uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for Applied.    Applieds intellectual property rights may not provide    significant competitive advantages if they are circumvented,    invalidated, rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of    technological change, or if Applied does not adequately assert    these rights. Furthermore, the laws and practices of other    countries, including China, Taiwan and Korea, permit the    protection and enforcement of Applieds rights to varying    extents, which may not be sufficient to protect Applieds    rights. If Applied is not able to obtain or enforce intellectual    property rights, resolve or settle claims, obtain necessary    licenses on commercially reasonable terms,    and/or    successfully prosecute or defend its position, Applieds    business, financial condition and results of operations could be    materially and adversely affected. Applied    is subject to risks of non-compliance with environmental and    safety regulations.     Applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in    connection with its global business operations, including but    not limited to: regulations related to the development,    manufacture and use of its products; recycling and disposal of    materials used in its products; the operation of its facilities;    and the use of its real property. The failure or inability to    comply with existing or future environmental and safety    regulations could result in: (1) significant remediation    liabilities; (2) the imposition of fines; (3) the    suspension or termination of the development, manufacture, sale    or use of certain of its products; (4) limitations on the    operation of its facilities or ability to use its real property;    and/or    (5) a decrease in the value of its real property, each of    which could have a material adverse effect on Applieds    business, financial condition and results of operations. Applied    is exposed to various risks related to the regulatory    environment.     Applied is subject to various risks related to: (1) new,    different, inconsistent or even conflicting laws, rules and    regulations that may be enacted by legislative bodies    and/or    regulatory agencies in the countries in which Applied operates;    (2) disagreements or disputes between national or regional    regulatory agencies related to international trade; and    (3) the interpretation and application of laws, rules and    regulations.

15,AMAT,APPLIED MATERIALS INC,2006-12-14,">Item 1A:      Risk    Factors The    industries that Applied serves is volatile and    unpredictable.     As a supplier to the global semiconductor and    semiconductor-related industries, Applied is subject to business    cycles, the timing, length and volatility of which can be    difficult to predict. The industries have historically been    cyclical due to sudden changes in demand and manufacturing    capacity, including capacity using the latest technology. The    effect on Applied of these changes in demand, including    end-customer demand, is occurring more rapidly, exacerbating the    volatility of these cycles. These changes have affected the    timing and amounts of customers purchases and investments    in technology, and continue to affect Applieds orders, net    sales, gross margin, contributed profit and results of    operations.     Applied must effectively manage its resources and production    capacity to meet changing demand. During periods of increasing    demand for semiconductor and semiconductor-related manufacturing    equipment, Applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity    and inventory to meet customer demand and must be able to    attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified    individuals and effectively manage its supply chain. During    periods of decreasing demand, Applied must be able to    appropriately align its cost structure with prevailing market    conditions, effectively motivate and retain key employees, and    effectively manage its supply chain. If Applied is not able to    timely and appropriately align its cost structure with business    conditions    and/or    effectively manage its resources and production capacity,    including its supply chain, during changes in demand,    Applieds business, financial condition or results of    operations may be materially and adversely affected. Applied    is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the    semiconductor and    semiconductor-related    industries.     The global industries in which Applied operates are    characterized by ongoing changes, including: (1) changes in    customers capacity requirements, capacity utilization and    capital spending, which depend in part on the demand for    customers products and their inventory levels relative to    demand; (2) the importance of reducing the cost of system    ownership, due in part to the increasing significance of    consumer electronics as a driver for semiconductor and display    demand and the related focus on lower prices; (3) varying    levels of business information technology spending;    (4) increasingly complex technology requirements, including    a significant rise in the number and importance of new materials    and importance of expertise in chemical processes and device    structure; (5) the growing types and varieties of    semiconductors and expanding number of applications across    multiple substrate sizes, resulting in customers divergent    technical demands and different rates of spending on capital    equipment; (6) customers varying adoption rates of    new technology; (7) a rising percentage of business from    customers in Asia and the emergence of customers, competitors    and suppliers in new geographical regions; (8) demand for    shorter cycle times for the development, manufacture and    installation of manufacturing equipment; (9) the heightened    importance to customers of system reliability and productivity,    and the effect on demand for systems as a result of their    increasing productivity, device yield and reliability;    (10) differing rates of market growth for, and capital    investments by, various semiconductor device makers, such as    memory (including NAND flash and DRAM), logic, foundry, display    and solar; (11) customers increasing use of    partnerships, alliances, joint ventures and industry consortia,    which has increased the influence of key integrated circuit    manufacturers in technology decisions made by their global    partners; (12) higher capital requirements for building and    operating new semiconductor fabrication plants; (13) the    increasing difficulty for customers to move from product design    to volume manufacturing; (14) the challenge to    semiconductor manufacturers of moving volume manufacturing from    one technology node to the next smaller technology node and the    resulting impact on the technology transition rate;    (15) the increasing cost and reduced affordability of    research and development due to many factors, including    decreasing linewidths and the increasing number of materials,    applications and process steps; (16) the industry growth    rate; (17) the increasing importance of the availability of    spare parts to assure maximum system uptime; (18) concern    among United States governmental agencies regarding possible    national commercial    and/or    security issues posed by the growing manufacturing business in    Asia; and (19) the increasing importance of operating    flexibility to enable different responses to different markets,    customers and applications. The solar market, which Applied    recently entered, is    13Table of Contents    also characterized by ongoing changes in demand for PV products    arising from, among other things, fluctuations in the cost of    fossil fuels and electric power, availability of government    subsidies, the performance and reliability of PV technology, and    the success of other renewable energy sources. If Applied does    not successfully manage the risks resulting from the ongoing    changes occurring in the semiconductor and semiconductor-related    industries, its business, financial condition and results of    operations could be materially and adversely affected. Applied    must adapt its business and product offerings to respond to    competition and rapid technological changes.     As Applied operates in a highly competitive environment, its    future success depends on many factors, including the effective    development, commercialization and customer acceptance of its    nanomanufacturing technology equipment, service and related    products. In addition, Applied must successfully execute its    growth strategy, including enhancing market share in existing    markets, expanding into related markets, and cultivating new    markets and new business models, while constantly improving its    operational performance. The development, introduction and    support of a broadening set of products in more varied    competitive environments have grown increasingly complex and    expensive over time. Applieds success is subject to many    risks, including but not limited to its ability to timely,    cost-effectively and successfully: (1) improve and develop    new applications for existing products and increase market share    in its existing markets; (2) develop, appropriately price,    and achieve market acceptance of new products; (3) expand    into or develop related and new markets for its    nanomanufacturing technology; (4) anticipate and capitalize    on opportunities in new markets, such as solar, and with new    technologies; (5) supply a range of Applied and non-Applied    products as part of its solar offerings; (6) appropriately    allocate resources, including RD&E funding, among    Applieds products and between the development of new    products and the improvement of existing products;    (7) accurately forecast demand and meet production    schedules for its products; (8) achieve cost efficiencies    across product offerings; (9) adapt to technology changes    in related markets, such as lithography; (10) develop,    market and price similar products for use by customers in    different applications    and/or    markets that may have varying technical requirements;    (11) adapt to changes in value offered by companies in    different parts of the supply chain; (12) qualify products    for volume manufacturing with its customers; (13) implement    changes in its design engineering methodology, including those    that enable significant decreases in material costs and cycle    time, greater commonality of platforms and types of parts used    in different systems, and effective product life cycle    management; (14) improve its manufacturing processes; and    (15) deploy initiatives to transform Applieds    information technology systems and enhance business processes,    including transitioning to a single-vendor enterprise resource    planning (ERP) software system. Furthermore, new or improved    products may involve higher costs and reduced efficiencies    compared to Applieds more established products and could    adversely affect Applieds gross margins. Also, entry into    new markets entails additional challenges, including those    arising from changes in Applieds customer    and/or    supplier base. In addition, Applied must regularly reassess the    size, capability and location of its global infrastructure and    timely make appropriate changes in its real estate and    facilities portfolio. If Applied does not successfully manage    these challenges, its business, financial condition and results    of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Applied    is exposed to the risks of operating a global    business.     In fiscal 2006, more than 80 percent of Applieds net    sales were to customers in regions outside the United States.    Certain of Applieds RD&E and manufacturing facilities,    as well as suppliers to Applied, are also located outside the    United States. Managing Applieds global operations    presents challenges, including but not limited to, those arising    from: (1) varying regional and geopolitical business    conditions and demands; (2) global trade issues;    (3) variations in protection of intellectual property and    other legal rights in different countries; (4) fluctuating    raw material and energy costs; (5) variations in the    ability to develop relationships with suppliers and other local    businesses; (6) changes in laws and regulations of the    United States (including export restrictions) and other    countries, as well as their interpretation and application;    (7) fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange    rates; (8) the need to provide sufficient levels of    technical support in different locations; (9) political    instability, natural disasters (such as earthquakes, floods or    storms), pandemics, terrorism or acts of war where Applied has    operations, suppliers or sales; (10) cultural differences;    (11) special customer- or government-supported efforts to    promote the development and growth of local competitors; and    (12) shipping costs    and/or    delays. Many of these challenges are present in China, which is    experiencing significant growth of both suppliers and    prospective    14Table of Contents    competitors to Applied, and which Applied believes presents a    large potential market for its products and opportunity for    growth over the long term. These challenges, as well as global    uncertainties with respect to: (1) economic growth rates in    various countries; (2) consumer confidence; (3) the    sustainability, timing, rate and amount of demand for    electronics products and integrated circuits; (4) capital    and operational spending by semiconductor and display    manufacturers; and (5) price trends for certain integrated    circuit devices, may materially and adversely affect    Applieds business, financial condition and results of    operations. Applied    is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated    customer base.     Applieds customer base is and has historically been highly    concentrated. Orders from a relatively limited number of    manufacturers have accounted for, and are expected to continue    to account for, a substantial portion of Applieds net    sales. In addition, the mix and type of customers, and sales to    any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to    quarter and from year to year. Moreover, certain customers,    particularly in emerging areas such as solar, may have capital    resource constraints    and/or a    limited operating history. If customers do not place orders, or    they delay or cancel orders, Applied may not be able to replace    the business. As Applieds products are configured to    customer specifications, changing, rescheduling or canceling    orders may result in significant non- recoverable costs. Major    customers may also seek, and on occasion receive, pricing,    payment, intellectual property-related or other commercial terms    that are less favorable to Applied. In addition, certain    customers have undergone significant ownership changes    and/or    formed strategic alliances or collaborative efforts, which may    result in additional complexities in managing customer    relationships and transactions. These factors could have a    material adverse effect on Applieds business, financial    condition and results of operations. Manufacturing    interruptions or delays could affect Applieds ability to    meet customer demand, while the failure to estimate customer    demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete    inventory.     Applieds business depends on its ability to supply    equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly    changing requirements of its customers, which depends in part on    the timely delivery of parts, components and subassemblies    (collectively, parts) from suppliers. Some key parts may be    subject to long lead-times    and/or    obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of    suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by    suppliers in developing regions, including China. In addition,    Applied has implemented several key operational initiatives    intended to improve manufacturing efficiency, including    integrate-to-order,    module-final-test and    merge-in-transit    programs. Applied has also begun a multi-year, company-wide    program to transform certain business processes that includes    transitioning to a single-vendor enterprise resource planning    (ERP) software system to perform various functions, such as    order management and manufacturing control. Significant    interruptions of manufacturing operations or the delivery of    services as a result of (1) the failure or inability of    suppliers to timely deliver quality parts; (2) volatility    in the availability and cost of materials; (3) difficulties    or delays in obtaining required export approvals;    (4) information technology or infrastructure failures;    (5) difficulties and costs related to planning or effecting    business process changes and implementing a new ERP system;    (6) natural disasters (such as earthquakes, floods or    storms); or (7) other causes (such as regional economic    downturns, pandemics, political instability, terrorism or acts    of war), could result in delayed deliveries, manufacturing    inefficiencies, increased costs or order cancellations.    Moreover, if actual demand for Applieds products is    different than expected, Applied may purchase more/fewer parts    than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or    expediting delivery of parts. Any or all of these factors could    materially and adversely affect Applieds business,    financial condition and results of operations. The    failure to successfully implement and conduct offshoring and    outsourcing activities could adversely affect results of    operations.     To better align costs with market conditions, increase its    presence in growing markets, and enhance productivity and    operational efficiency, Applied conducts engineering, software    development and other operations in regions outside the United    States, particularly India and China, and outsources certain    functions to third parties, including companies in the United    States, India, China and other countries. Outsourced functions    include engineering, manufacturing, customer support, software    development and administrative activities. The expanding role of    third party providers has required changes to Applieds    existing operations and the adoption of new    15Table of Contents    procedures and processes for retaining and managing these    providers in order to protect its intellectual property. If    Applied does not effectively develop and implement its    offshoring and outsourcing strategies, if required export and    other governmental approvals are not timely obtained, or if    Applieds third party providers do not perform as    anticipated, Applied may not realize productivity improvements    or cost efficiencies and may experience operational    difficulties, increased costs, manufacturing interruptions or    delays, loss of its intellectual property rights, quality    issues, increased product    time-to-marketand/or    inefficient allocation of human resources, any or all of which    could materially and adversely affect Applieds business,    financial condition and results of operations. Applied    is exposed to risks associated with acquisitions and strategic    investments.     Applied has made, and in the future intends to make,    acquisitions of, or investments in, companies, technologies or    products in existing, related or new markets for Applied.    Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including but not limited    to: (1) diversion of managements attention from other    operational matters; (2) inability to complete acquisitions    as anticipated or at all; (3) inability to realize    anticipated benefits; (4) failure to commercialize    purchased technologies; (5) inability to capitalize on    characteristics of new markets that may be significantly    different from Applieds existing markets;    (6) inability to obtain and protect intellectual property    rights in key technologies; (7) ineffectiveness of an    acquired companys internal controls; (8) impairment    of acquired intangible assets as a result of technological    advancements or    worse-than-expected    performance of the acquired company or its product offerings;    (9) unknown, underestimated    and/or    undisclosed commitments or liabilities; (10) excess or    underutilized facilities; and (11) ineffective integration    of operations, technologies, products or employees of the    acquired companies. Applied also makes strategic investments in    other companies, including companies formed as joint ventures,    which may decline in value    and/or not    meet desired objectives. The success of these investments    depends on various factors over which Applied may have limited    or no control and, particularly with respect to joint ventures,    requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic    partners. Mergers and acquisitions and strategic investments are    inherently subject to significant risks, and the inability to    effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely    affect Applieds business, financial condition and results    of operations. The    ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital    to Applieds success.     Applieds success and competitiveness depend in large part    on its ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees.    Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors,    including fluctuations in global economic and industry    conditions, changes in Applieds management or leadership,    competitors hiring practices, and the effectiveness of    Applieds compensation programs, including its equity-based    programs. Applied regularly evaluates its overall compensation    program and makes adjustments, as appropriate, to enhance its    competitiveness, such as instituting broad-based grants of    restricted stock units in fiscal 2006. If Applied does not    successfully attract, retain and motivate key employees,    Applieds ability to capitalize on its opportunities and    its operating results may be materially and adversely affected. Changes    in tax rates or tax liabilities could affect    results.     As a global company, Applied is subject to taxation in the    United States and various other countries. Significant judgment    is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities.    Applieds future annual and quarterly tax rates could be    affected by numerous factors, including changes in the    (1) applicable tax laws; (2) composition of earnings    in countries with differing tax rates; or (3) valuation of    Applieds deferred tax assets and liabilities. In addition,    Applied is subject to regular examination of its income tax    returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax    authorities. Applied regularly assesses the likelihood of    favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these    examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for    income taxes. Although Applied believes its tax estimates are    reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final    determination will not be materially different from the    treatment reflected in Applieds historical income tax    provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely    affect Applieds results of operations.    16Table of ContentsApplied    is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or    claims and protection of intellectual property    rights.     Applied from time to time is, and in the future may be, involved    in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement,    intellectual property rights, antitrust, environmental    regulations, securities, contracts, product performance, product    liability, unfair competition, employment and other matters. In    addition, Applied on occasion receives notification from    customers who believe that Applied owes them indemnification or    other obligations related to claims made against customers by    third parties. These legal proceedings and claims, whether with    or without merit, may be time-consuming and expensive to    prosecute or defend and also divert managements attention    and resources. There can be no assurance regarding the outcome    of current or future legal proceedings or claims. Applied    previously entered into a mutual    covenant-not-to-sue    arrangement with one of its competitors to decrease the risk of    patent infringement lawsuits in the future. There can be no    assurance that the intended results of this arrangement will be    achieved or that Applied will be able to adequately protect its    intellectual property rights with the restrictions associated    with such a covenant. In addition, Applieds success    depends in significant part on the protection of its    intellectual property and other rights. Infringement of    Applieds rights by a third party, such as the unauthorized    manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts, could result in    uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for Applied.    Applieds intellectual property rights may not provide    significant competitive advantages if they are circumvented,    invalidated, rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of    technological change, or if Applied does not adequately assert    these rights. Furthermore, the laws and practices of other    countries, including China, Taiwan and Korea, permit the    protection and enforcement of Applieds rights to varying    extents, which may not be sufficient to protect Applieds    rights. If Applied is not able to obtain or enforce intellectual    property rights, resolve or settle claims, obtain necessary    licenses on commercially reasonable terms,    and/or    successfully prosecute or defend its position, Applieds    business, financial condition and results of operations could be    materially and adversely affected. Applied    is subject to risks of non-compliance with environmental and    safety regulations.     Applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in    connection with its global business operations, including but    not limited to regulations related to the development,    manufacture and use of its products; recycling and disposal of    materials used in its products; the operation of its facilities;    and the use of its real property. Failure or inability to comply    with existing or future environmental and safety regulations    could result in significant remediation liabilities, the    imposition of fines    and/or the    suspension or termination of development, manufacture, sale or    use of certain of its products,    and/or may    affect the operation of its facilities, use or value of its real    property, each of which could have a material adverse effect on    Applieds business, financial condition and results of    operations. Applied    is exposed to various risks related to the regulatory    environment.     Applied is subject to various risks related to: (1) new,    different, inconsistent or even conflicting laws, rules and    regulations that may be enacted by legislative bodies    and/or    regulatory agencies in the countries in which Applied operates;    (2) disagreements or disputes between national or regional    regulatory agencies related to international trade; and    (3) the interpretation and application of laws, rules and    regulations. If Applied is found by a court or regulatory agency    not to be in compliance with applicable laws, rules or    regulations, Applieds business, financial condition and    results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Applied    is subject to internal control evaluations and attestation    requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley    Act.     Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,    Applied must include in its annual report on    Form 10-K    a report of management on the effectiveness of Applieds    internal control over financial reporting and an attestation by    Applieds independent registered public accounting firm to    the adequacy of managements assessment of Applieds    internal control. Ongoing compliance with these requirements is    complex, costly and time-consuming. If (1) Applied fails to    maintain effective internal control over financial reporting;    (2) Applieds management does not timely assess the    adequacy of such internal control; or (3) Applieds    independent registered    17Table of Contents    public accounting firm does not timely attest to the evaluation,    Applied could be subject to regulatory sanctions and the    publics perception of Applied may decline. "
