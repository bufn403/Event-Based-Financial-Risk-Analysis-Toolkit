9,CMC,COMMERCIAL METALS,2023-10-12,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSThere are inherent risks and uncertainties associated with our business that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Set forth below are descriptions of those risks and uncertainties that we currently believe to be material, but the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESSScrap and other inputs for our business are subject to significant price fluctuations and limited availability, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. At any given time, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of critical raw materials at a price and on other terms acceptable to us. We depend on ferrous scrap, the primary raw material used by our steel mills, and other inputs such as graphite electrodes and alloys for our steel mill operations. The price of scrap and other inputs has historically been subject to significant fluctuation, and we may not be able to adjust our product prices to recover the costs of rapid increases in raw material prices, especially over the short-term and in our fixed price contracts. The profitability of our operations would be adversely affected if we are unable to pass increased raw material and input costs on to our customers.  The purchase prices for automobile bodies and various other grades of obsolete and industrial scrap, as well as the selling prices for processed and recycled scrap metals we utilize in our own manufacturing process or resell to others, are highly volatile. A prolonged period of low scrap prices or a fall in scrap prices could impair our ability to obtain, process, sell and consume recycled material, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices may be limited by competitive or other factors during periods of low scrap prices, when the supply of scrap may decline considerably, as scrap generators hold onto their scrap in the hope of getting higher prices later. Conversely, increased foreign demand for scrap due to economic expansion in countries such as China, India, Brazil and Turkey can result in an outflow of available domestic scrap as well as higher scrap prices that cannot always be passed on to domestic scrap consumers or consumers of our steel products, further reducing the available domestic scrap flows and margins, all of which could adversely affect our sales and profitability. 9Table of ContentsThe availability of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations, allocations by suppliers, interruptions in production, accidents or natural disasters, changes in exchange rates, global price fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation. If we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials, we may be unable to timely manufacture significant quantities of our products. We are vulnerable to the economic conditions in the regions in which our operations are concentrated.Economic downturns in the U.S., United Kingdom (the ""U.K.""), Central Europe and China, or decisions by governments that have an impact on the level and pace of overall economic activity in one of these regions, could adversely affect demand for our products and, consequently, our sales and profitability. As a result, our financial results are substantially dependent upon the overall economic conditions in these areas.We rely on the availability of large amounts of electricity and natural gas. Disruptions in delivery or substantial increases in energy costs, including crude oil prices, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our EAF mills melt steel scrap and use natural gas to heat steel billets for rolling into finished steel products. As large consumers of electricity and gas, often the largest in the geographic area where our mills are located, we must have dependable delivery of electricity and natural gas in order to operate. Accordingly, we are at risk in the event of an energy disruption. Prolonged black-outs or brown-outs or disruptions caused by natural disasters such as hurricanes would substantially disrupt our production. While we have not suffered prolonged production delays due to our inability to access electricity or natural gas, several of our competitors have experienced such occurrences. Prolonged substantial increases in energy costs would have an adverse effect on the costs of operating our mills and would negatively impact our profitability unless we were able to fully pass through the additional expense to our customers. Our finished steel products are typically delivered by truck. Rapid increases in the price of fuel attributable to increases in crude oil prices would increase our costs and adversely affect many of our customers' financial results, which in turn could result in reduced margins and declining demand for our products. We may encounter labor disputes and shortages for skilled labor and/or qualified employees in operational positions, which could adversely impact our operations.Our employees contribute to developing and meeting our business goals and objectives, and we depend on a qualified labor force for the manufacture of our products. The impact of  labor shortages and increased competition for available workers may increase our costs or impede our ability to optimally staff our facilities and could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, an ongoing labor shortage may result in increased expenses related to hiring and retention of qualified employees. As our experienced employees retire and we lose their institutional knowledge, we may encounter challenges and may have difficulty replacing them with employees of comparable skill and efficiency. Additionally, as of August 31, 2023, 14% and 29% of the employees in our North America and Europe segments, respectively, belong to unions. While believe that we have good relations with the union representatives, there can be no assurance that any future labor negotiations will prove successful, which may result in a significant increase in the cost of labor, or may break down and result in the disruption of our business or operations.The loss of, or inability to hire, key employees may adversely affect our ability to successfully manage our operations and meet our strategic objectives. Our future success depends, in large part, on the continued service of our officers and other key employees and our ability to continue to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel. These employees are integral to our success based on their expertise and knowledge of our business and products. We compete for such personnel with other companies, including public and private company competitors who may periodically offer more favorable terms of employment. The loss or interruption of the services of a number of our key employees could reduce our ability to effectively manage our operations should we be unable to find appropriate replacement personnel in a timely manner should the need arise. For example, as part of the Company's succession plan, Peter R. Matt became our Chief Executive Officer effective September 1, 2023. Failure to successfully execute this leadership transition and retain key employees could negatively impact our business and results of operations.Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of inflation.Inflation has the potential to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations by increasing our overall cost structure, particularly if we are unable to achieve commensurate increases in the prices we charge our customers. 10Table of ContentsOther inflationary pressures could affect wages, energy prices, the cost and availability of components and raw materials and other inputs and our ability to meet customer demand. Inflation may further exacerbate other risk factors, including supply chain disruptions, risks related to international operations and the recruitment and retention of qualified employees.We may have difficulty competing with companies that have a lower cost structure or access to greater financial resources. We compete with regional, national and foreign manufacturers and traders. Consolidation among participants in the steel manufacturing and recycling industries has resulted in fewer competitors, and several of our competitors are significantly larger than us and have greater financial resources and more diverse businesses than us. Some of our foreign competitors may be able to pursue business opportunities without regard to certain laws and regulations with which we must comply, such as environmental regulations. These companies may have a lower cost structure and more operating flexibility, and consequently they may be able to offer better prices and more services than we can. There is no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with these companies. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Operating and startup risks, as well as market risks associated with the commissioning of our micro mills, could prevent us from realizing anticipated benefits and could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our investments.Although we have successfully commissioned and operated similar facilities, there are technological, operational, market and start-up risks associated with the construction and commissioning of our third and fourth micro mills. Construction of our micro mills is subject to changing market conditions, delays, inflation and cost overruns, work stoppages, labor shortages, weather interferences, supply chain delays, changes required by governmental authorities, delays or the inability to acquire required permits or licenses, any of which could have an adverse impact on our operational and financial results. Further, although we believe these facilities should each be capable of consistently producing high-quality products in sufficient quantities and at costs that will compare favorably with other similar steel manufacturing facilities, there can be no assurance that these expectations will be achieved. If we encounter cost overruns, system or process difficulties during commissioning or after startup or quality control restrictions with either or both facilities, our capital costs could increase materially, the expected benefits from the development of the applicable facilities could be diminished or lost, and we could lose all or a substantial portion of our investments. We could also encounter commodity market risk if, during a sustained period, the cost to manufacture is greater than projected or the market prices for steel products decline.Our mills require continual capital investments that we may not be able to sustain. We must make regular substantial capital investments in our steel mills to maintain the mills, lower production costs and remain competitive. We cannot be certain that we will have sufficient internally generated cash or acceptable external financing to make necessary substantial capital expenditures in the future. The availability of external financing depends on many factors outside of our control, including capital market conditions and the overall performance of the economy. If funding is insufficient, we may be unable to develop or enhance our mills, take advantage of business opportunities and respond to competitive pressures.Unexpected equipment failures may lead to production curtailments or shutdowns, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Interruptions in our production capabilities would adversely affect our production costs, products available for sale and earnings for the affected period. Our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of steelmaking equipment, such as our furnaces, continuous casters and rolling equipment, as well as electrical equipment, such as transformers. This equipment may, on occasion, be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, material plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such equipment failures. In addition to equipment failures, our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, explosions or violent weather conditions.Information technology interruptions and breaches in data security could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.We rely on computers, information and communications technology and related systems and networks in order to operate our business, including to store sensitive data such as intellectual property, our own proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners and personally identifiable information of our employees. Increased global information technology security requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and a rise in sophisticated and targeted cyber attacks, 11Table of Contentswhich may be heightened in times of hostilities or war, computer viruses, phishing attacks, social engineering schemes, malicious code, ransomware attacks, acts of terrorism and physical or electronic security breaches, including breaches by computer hackers, cyber-terrorists and/or unauthorized access to or disclosure of our and/or our employees’ or customers’ data pose a risk to the security of our systems, networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Our systems and networks are also subject to damage or interruption from power outages, natural disasters, telecommunications failures, intentional or inadvertent user misuse, employee error, operator negligence and other similar events. Any of these or other events could result in system interruption, the disclosure, modification or destruction of proprietary and other key information, corruption of data, legal claims or proceedings, government enforcement actions, civil or criminal penalties, increased cyber security protection and remediation costs, production delays or disruptions to operations including processing transactions and reporting financial results and could adversely impact our reputation and our operating results. We have taken steps to address these concerns and have implemented internal control and security measures to protect our systems and networks from security breaches; however, measures that the Company takes to avoid, detect, mitigate or recover from material incidents, may be insufficient, circumvented, or may become ineffective and there can be no assurance that a system or network failure, or security breach, will not impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. As cyber security threats continue to evolve and become more sophisticated, we may be required to incur significant costs and invest additional resources to protect against and, if required, remediate the damage caused by such disruptions or system failures in the future.Increasing attention to ESG matters, including any targets or other ESG or environmental justice initiatives, could result in additional costs or risks or adverse impacts on our business.Our business faces increasing scrutiny related to ESG issues, including environmental stewardship, supply chain management, climate change, diversity and inclusion, workplace conduct, human rights, philanthropy and support for local communities. Implementation of our environmental and sustainability initiatives, including the goals set forth in our annual sustainability report requires certain financial expenditures and employee resources, and the implementation of certain ESG practices or disclosures. If we fail to meet applicable standards or expectations with respect to these issues, including the expectations we establish for our business, our reputation and brand could be damaged, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. Investors, stakeholders and other interested parties are also increasingly focused on issues related to environmental justice and ESG in general. This may result in increased scrutiny, protests and negative publicity with respect to our business and operations, which could in turn result in the cancellation or delay of projects, the revocation of permits, termination of contracts, lawsuits, regulatory action and policy change that may adversely affect our business strategy, increase our costs, or adversely affect our reputation and performance.We are subject to litigation, potential liability claims and contract disputes, and may become subject to additional litigation, claims and disputes in the future, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are involved in various litigation matters, including regulatory proceedings, administrative proceedings, governmental investigations, environmental matters and construction contract disputes. The nature of our operations also exposes us to possible litigation claims in the future. Furthermore, the manufacture and sale of our products as well as the use of our products in a wide variety of commercial and industrial applications expose us to potential product liability and related claims. In the event that a product of ours fails to perform as expected, regardless of fault, or is used in an unexpected manner, and such failure or use results in, or is alleged to result in, bodily injury and/or property damage or other losses, we may be subject to product liability and product quality claims.Because of the uncertain nature of litigation and insurance coverage decisions, we cannot predict the outcome of these matters. These matters could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. Litigation is very costly, and the costs associated with prosecuting and defending litigation matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we are unable to precisely estimate the ultimate dollar amount of exposure to loss in connection with litigation matters, we make accruals as warranted. However, the amounts that we accrue could vary significantly from the amounts we actually pay, due to inherent uncertainties, including the inherent uncertainties of the estimation process, the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors. See Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report for a description of our current material legal proceedings.Potential limitations on our ability to access credit, or the ability of our customers and suppliers to access credit, may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If our access to credit is limited or impaired, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. Our senior unsecured notes are rated by Standard & Poor's Corporation, Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Group, 12Table of ContentsInc. In determining our credit ratings, the rating agencies consider a number of both quantitative and qualitative factors. These factors include earnings (loss), fixed charges such as interest, cash flows, total debt outstanding, off-balance sheet obligations and other commitments, total capitalization and various ratios calculated from these factors. The rating agencies also consider predictability of cash flows, business strategy and diversity, industry conditions and contingencies. Any downgrades in our credit ratings may make raising capital more difficult, increase the cost and affect the terms of future borrowings, affect the terms under which we purchase goods and services and limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities. We could also be adversely affected if our banks refused to honor their contractual commitments or cease lending.We are also exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our customers and suppliers. In certain markets, we have experienced a consolidation among those entities to whom we sell. This consolidation has resulted in an increased credit risk spread among fewer customers, often without a corresponding strengthening of their financial status. If the availability of credit to fund or support the continuation and expansion of our customers' business operations is curtailed or if the cost of that credit is increased, the resulting inability of our customers or of their customers to either access credit or absorb the increased cost of that credit could adversely affect our business by reducing our sales or by increasing our exposure to losses from uncollectible customer accounts. The consequences of such adverse effects could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers, the reduction, delay or cancellation of customer orders, delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase and bankruptcy of customers, suppliers or other creditors. Any of these events may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.The impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on the global economy, energy supplies and raw materials is uncertain, but may continue to negatively impact our business and operations.Since early 2022, Russia and Ukraine have been engaged in active armed conflict. We continue to monitor the adverse impact that the outbreak of war in Ukraine and the subsequent institution of sanctions against Russia by the U.S. and several European and Asian countries may continue to have on the global economy in general, on our business and operations and on the businesses and operations of our suppliers and customers. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has led to market disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices and credit markets, as well as reductions in demand and supply chain interruptions, and contributed to global inflation. Further, if the conflict intensifies or expands beyond Ukraine, it could continue to have an adverse, indirect impact on our operations in Poland. The Russian invasion of Ukraine did not have a direct material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations during 2023 or 2022. However, we will continue to monitor this fluid situation and develop contingency plans as necessary to address any disruptions to our business operations. To the extent the war in Ukraine may continue to adversely affect our business as discussed above, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors
” section, such as those relating to data security, supply chain, volatility in prices of scrap, energy and other inputs, and market conditions, any of which could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.The potential impact of our customers' non-compliance with existing commercial contracts and commitments, due to insolvency or for any other reason, may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.From time to time in the past, some of our customers have sought to renegotiate or cancel their existing purchase commitments with us. In addition, some of our customers have breached previously agreed upon contracts to buy our products by refusing delivery of the products. Where appropriate, we have and expect to in the future pursue litigation to recover our damages resulting from customer contract defaults and bankruptcy filings. We use credit assessments in the U.S. and credit insurance in Poland to mitigate the risk of customer insolvency. However, a large number of our customers defaulting on existing contractual obligations to purchase our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.The agreements governing our notes and our other debt contain financial covenants and impose restrictions on our business. The indentures governing our 4.125% Senior Notes due 2030, our 3.875% Senior Notes due 2031 and our 4.375% Senior Notes due 2032 contain restrictions on our ability to create liens, sell assets, enter into sale and leaseback transactions and consummate transactions causing a change of control such as a merger or consolidation. In addition to these restrictions, our Credit Agreement, as defined in Note 8, Credit Arrangements, in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, contains covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things, enter into transactions with affiliates and guarantee the debt of some of our subsidiaries. Our Credit Agreement and U.S. Facility, as defined in Note 8, Credit Arrangements, in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report also require that we meet certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios, including maximum debt to capitalization and interest coverage ratios. The loan agreement related to the Series 2022 Bonds, as defined in Note 8, Credit 13Table of ContentsArrangements, in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, also restricts our ability to, among other things, enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions, incur certain liens and take certain actions that would adversely affect the tax-exempt status of the Series 2022 Bonds.Other agreements that we may enter into in the future may contain covenants imposing significant restrictions on our business that are similar to, or in addition to, the covenants under our existing agreements. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. The breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the indentures governing our notes or under our other debt agreements. An event of default under our debt agreements would permit our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If we were unable to repay debt to our secured lenders or if we incur additional secured debt in the future, these lenders could proceed against the collateral securing such debt. In addition, acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on our notes.We may not be able to successfully identify, consummate or integrate acquisitions, and acquisitions may adversely affect our financial leverage. Part of our business strategy includes pursuing synergistic acquisitions. We have expanded, and plan to continue to expand, our business by making strategic acquisitions and regularly seeking suitable acquisition targets to enhance our growth. We may fund such acquisitions using cash on hand, drawing under our credit facility or accessing the capital markets. To the extent we finance such acquisitions with additional debt, the incurrence of such debt may result in a significant increase in our interest expense and financial leverage, which could be further exacerbated by volatility in the debt capital markets. Further, an increase in our leverage could lead to deterioration in our credit ratings.The pursuit of acquisitions may pose certain risks to us. We may not be able to identify acquisition candidates that fit our criteria for growth and profitability. Even if we are able to identify such candidates, we may not be able to acquire them on terms or financing satisfactory to us. We will incur expenses and dedicate attention and resources associated with the review of acquisition opportunities, whether or not we consummate such acquisitions. Additionally, even if we are able to acquire suitable targets on agreeable terms, we may not be able to successfully integrate their operations with ours. Achieving the anticipated benefits of any acquisition will depend in significant part upon whether we integrate such acquired businesses in an efficient and effective manner. We may not be able to achieve the anticipated operating and cost synergies or long-term strategic benefits of our acquisitions within the anticipated timing or at all. For example, elimination of duplicative costs may not be fully achieved or may take longer than anticipated. The benefits from any acquisition may be offset by the costs incurred in integrating the businesses and operations. We may also assume liabilities in connection with acquisitions to which we would not otherwise be exposed. An inability to realize any or all of the anticipated synergies or other benefits of an acquisition as well as any delays that may be encountered in the integration process, which may delay the timing of such synergies or other benefits, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We review the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as of the first day of our fourth quarter, and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, or an indefinite-lived intangible asset may not be recoverable. To evaluate goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we may use qualitative assessments to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. The qualitative assessments require assumptions to be made regarding multiple factors, including the current operating environment, historical and future financial performance and industry and market conditions. If an initial qualitative assessment identifies that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, additional quantitative testing is performed. Alternatively, the Company may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and instead perform a quantitative impairment test to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit in comparison to its associated carrying value.14Table of ContentsThe quantitative impairment tests require us to make an estimate of the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. An impairment could be recorded as a result of changes in assumptions, estimates or circumstances, some of which are beyond our control. Factors which could result in an impairment include, but are not limited to: (i) reduced demand for our products; (ii) our cost of capital; (iii) higher material prices; (iv) slower growth rates in our industry; and (v) changes in the market based discount rates. Since a number of factors may influence determinations of fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, we are unable to predict whether impairments will occur in the future, and there can be no assurance that continued conditions will not result in future impairments. The future occurrence of a potential indicator of impairment could include matters such as (i) a decrease in expected net earnings; (ii) adverse equity market conditions; (iii) a decline in current market multiples; (iv) a decline in our common stock price; (v) a significant adverse change in legal factors or the general business climate; (vi) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; (vii) a significant downturn in residential or non-residential construction markets in the U.S.; and (viii) levels of imported steel into the U.S. Any such impairment would result in us recognizing a non-cash charge in our consolidated statements of earnings, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Impairment of long-lived assets in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We have a significant amount of property, plant and equipment, finite-lived intangible assets and right-of-use (""ROU"") assets that may be subject to impairment testing. Long-lived assets are subject to an impairment assessment when certain triggering events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may be impaired. If the net carrying value of the asset or group of assets exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows of the operations related to the asset, the excess of the net carrying value over estimated fair value is charged to impairment loss in the consolidated statements of earnings. The primary factors that affect estimates of future cash flows for these long-lived asset groups are (i) management's raw material price outlook; (ii) market demand; (iii) working capital changes; (iv) capital expenditures; and (v) selling, general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses. There can be no assurance that continued market conditions, demand for our products, facility utilization levels or other factors will not result in future impairment charges.Competition from other materials may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In many applications, steel competes with other materials, such as aluminum and plastics (particularly in the automobile industry), cement, composites, glass and wood. Increased use of, or additional substitutes for, steel products could adversely affect future market prices and demand for steel products.Our operations present significant risk of injury or death. The industrial activities conducted at our facilities present significant risk of serious injury or death to our employees, customers or other visitors to our operations. Notwithstanding our safety precautions, including our material compliance with federal, state and local employee health and safety regulations, we may be unable to avoid material liabilities for injuries or deaths. We maintain workers' compensation insurance to address the risk of incurring material liabilities for injuries or deaths, but there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage will be adequate or will continue to be available on the terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could result in material liabilities to us for any injuries or deaths.Our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and stock price may be adversely affected by global public health epidemics.Pandemics, epidemics, widespread illness or other health issues, including the COVID-19 pandemic (""COVID-19""), that interfere with the ability of our employees, suppliers, customers, financing sources or others to conduct business, or negatively affect consumer confidence or the global economy, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and stock price.Despite the limited impact of COVID-19 on our operations to date, a resurgence of COVID-19 or any other public health crisis may negatively impact our operations, supply chain, transportation networks and customers, which may compress our margins, including as a result of preventative and precautionary measures that we, other businesses and governments are taking. Any economic downturn resulting from the widespread public health impacts of COVID-19 or any future public health crisis could adversely affect demand for our products and contribute to volatile supply and demand conditions affecting prices and volumes in the markets for our products and raw materials. 15Table of ContentsFluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar, including, in particular, the increased strength of the U.S. dollar as compared to Turkey's lira, China's renminbi or the euro, may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. A strong U.S. dollar makes imported metal products less expensive, resulting in more imports of steel products into the U.S. by our foreign competitors, while a weak U.S. dollar may have the opposite impact on imports. With the exception of exports of nonferrous scrap metal by the recycling facilities in our North America segment, we have not recently been a significant exporter of metal products. Economic difficulties in some large steel-producing regions of the world, resulting in lower local demand for steel products, have historically encouraged greater steel exports to the U.S. at depressed prices which can be exacerbated by a strong U.S. dollar. As a result, our products that are made in the U.S. may become relatively more expensive as compared to imported steel, which has had, and in the future could have, a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Operating internationally carries risks and uncertainties which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have significant recycling and fabrication facilities and a mini mill in Poland as well as Tensar facilities in China and England. Our Europe segment, which comprises our international operations, generated approximately 16% of 2023 consolidated net sales. Our stability, growth and profitability are subject to a number of risks inherent in doing business internationally in addition to the currency exchange risk and operating risks discussed above, including:•political, military, terrorist or major pandemic events;•differences in demand, production and energy costs;•local labor and social issues;•legal and regulatory requirements or limitations imposed by foreign governments (particularly those with significant steel consumption or steel-related production including Turkey, China, Brazil, Russia and India), including quotas, tariffs or other protectionist trade barriers, adverse tax law changes, nationalization or currency restrictions;•disruptions or delays in shipments caused by customs compliance or government agencies; and •potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations.These factors may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Hedging transactions may expose us to losses or limit our potential gains. Our product lines and global operations expose us to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. As part of our risk management program, we sometimes use financial instruments, including metals commodity futures, natural gas, electricity and other energy forward contracts, freight forward contracts, foreign currency exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts. While intended to reduce the effects of fluctuations in these prices and rates, these transactions may limit our potential gains or expose us to losses. If our counterparties to such transactions or the sponsors of the exchanges through which these transactions are offered, such as the London Metal Exchange, fail to honor their obligations due to financial distress, we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipated gains from these transactions.We enter into the foreign currency exchange forward contracts as economic hedges of trade commitments or anticipated commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency to mitigate the effects of changes in currency rates. These foreign exchange commitments are dependent on timely performance by our counterparties. Their failure to perform could result in us having to close these hedges without the anticipated underlying transaction and could result in losses if foreign currency exchange rates have changed.There can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares of our common stock at all or in any particular amounts.The stock markets in general have experienced substantial price and trading fluctuations, which have resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities that often are unrelated or disproportionate to changes in operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Price volatility over a given period may also cause the average price at which we repurchase our own common stock to exceed the stock's price at a given point in time. In addition, 16Table of Contentssignificant changes in the trading price of our common stock and our ability to access capital on terms favorable to us could impact our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock. The timing and amount of any repurchases will be determined by the Company's management based on its evaluation of market conditions, capital allocation alternatives and other factors beyond our control. Our share repurchase program may be modified, suspended, extended or terminated by the Company at any time and without notice. See Note 15, Capital Stock, in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information on our share repurchase program.RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRYOur industry and the industries we serve are vulnerable to global economic conditions. Metals industries and commodity products have historically been vulnerable to significant declines in consumption, global overcapacity and depressed product pricing during prolonged periods of economic downturn. Our business supports cyclical industries such as commercial, government and residential construction, energy, metals service center, petrochemical and original equipment manufacturing. We may experience significant fluctuations in demand for our products from these industries based on global or regional economic conditions, energy prices, consumer demand and decisions by governments to fund infrastructure projects such as highways, schools, energy plants and airports. Commercial and infrastructure construction activities related to the residential housing market, such as shopping centers, schools and roads, could be adversely impacted by a prolonged slump in new housing construction. Our business, results of operations and financial condition are adversely affected when the industries we serve suffer a prolonged downturn or anemic growth. Because we do not have unlimited backlogs, our business, results of operations and financial condition are promptly affected by short-term economic fluctuations.We are unable to predict the duration of current economic conditions that are contributing to current demand for our products. Future economic downturns or a prolonged period of slow growth or economic stagnation could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Excess capacity and over-production by foreign producers in the steel industry as well as the startup of new steelmaking capacity in the U.S. could result in lower domestic steel prices, which would adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability. Global steelmaking capacity exceeds demand for steel products in some regions around the world. Rather than reducing employment by rationalizing capacity with consumption, steel manufacturers in these countries (often with local government assistance or subsidies in various forms) have traditionally periodically exported steel at prices significantly below their home market prices, which prices may not reflect their costs of production or capital. For example, steel production in China, the world's largest producer and consumer of steel, has continued to exceed Chinese demand. This excess capacity in China has resulted in a further increase in imports of artificially low-priced steel and steel products to the U.S. and world steel markets. A continuation of this trend or a significant decrease in China's rate of economic expansion could result in increasing steel imports from China. Excessive imports of steel into the U.S. have exerted, and may continue to exert, downward pressure on U.S. steel prices, which negatively affects our ability to increase our sales, margins and profitability. The excess capacity may create downward pressure on our steel prices and lead to reduced sales volumes as imports absorb market share that would otherwise be filled by domestic supply, all of which would adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability and could subject us to possible renegotiation of contracts or increases in bad debt. Excess capacity has also led to greater protectionism as is evident in raw material and finished product border tariffs put in place by China, Brazil and other countries. We believe the downward pressure on, and periodically depressed levels of, U.S. steel prices in some recent years have been further exacerbated by imports of steel involving dumping and subsidy abuses by foreign steel producers. While some tariffs and quotas are periodically put into effect for certain steel products imported from a number of countries that have been found to have been unfairly pricing steel imports to the U.S., there is no assurance that tariffs and quotas will always be levied, even if otherwise justified, and even when imposed many of these are short-lived or ineffective. On March 8, 2018, the President signed a proclamation imposing a 25% tariff or quota limits on all imported steel products for an indefinite period of time under Section 232. The tariff or quota limits are imposed on all steel imports with the exception of steel imports originating from Australia, Canada and Mexico. During 2022, the current administration converted the tariff on steel imports from the European Union, U.K. and Japan to a tariff rate quota. When the Section 232 or other import tariffs, quotas or duties expire or if others are further relaxed or repealed, or if relatively higher U.S. steel prices make it attractive for foreign steelmakers to export their steel products to the U.S., despite the presence of import tariffs, quotas or duties, the resurgence of substantial imports of foreign steel could create downward pressure on U.S. steel prices.The adverse effects of excess capacity and over-production by foreign producers could be exacerbated by the startup of new 17Table of Contentssteelmaking capacity in the U.S. Any of these adverse effects could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Rapid and significant changes in the price of metals could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Prices for most metals in which we deal have experienced increased volatility over the last several years, and such increased price volatility impacts us in several ways. While our downstream products may benefit from metal margin expansion as rapidly decreasing input costs for previously contracted fixed price work declines, our steel products would likely experience reduced metal margin and may be forced to liquidate high-cost inventory at reduced metal margins or losses until prices stabilize. Sudden increases in input costs could have the opposite effect in each case. Overall, we believe that rapid substantial price changes are not to our industry's benefit. Our customer and supplier base would be impacted due to uncertainty as to future prices. A reluctance to purchase inventory in the face of extreme price decreases or to sell quickly during a period of rapid price increases would likely reduce our volume of business. Marginal industry participants or speculators may attempt to participate to an unhealthy extent during a period of rapid price escalation with a substantial risk of contract default if prices suddenly reverse. Risks of default in contract performance by customers or suppliers as well as an increased risk of bad debts and customer credit exposure could increase during periods of rapid and substantial price changes.Physical impacts of climate change could have a material adverse effect on our costs and results of operations.The physical impacts of climate change may result in, among other things, increasing temperatures and an increase in extreme weather events such as droughts, wildfires, thunderstorms, snow or ice storms, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes and rising sea levels. Extreme weather conditions and natural disasters may increase our costs, limit the availability of materials, cause damage to our facilities or result in a prolonged disruption to our operations, and any damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. Many of our facilities are located near coastal areas or waterways where rising sea levels or flooding could disrupt our operations or adversely impact our facilities. Additionally, two of our micro mills are located in an arid desert climate, where drought may restrict available water supplies and increase the risk of wildfires. Furthermore, major changes in weather patterns, periods of extended inclement weather or associated flooding may inhibit construction activity utilizing our products, result in project cancellations, delay or hinder shipments of our products to customers or reduce scrap metal inflows to our recycling facilities or disrupt the availability of electricity to our facilities. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on our costs or results of operations. RISKS RELATED TO THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTCompliance with and changes in environmental laws and regulations and remediation requirements could result in substantially increased capital obligations and operating costs; violations of environmental laws and regulations could result in costs that have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Existing environmental laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, and future laws and regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is a significant factor in our business. We are subject to local, state, federal and international environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other matters, waste disposal, air emissions, waste and storm water effluent and disposal and employee health. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may seek injunctive relief impacting continuing operations for non-compliance with environmental requirements. New facilities that we may build, especially steel mills, are required to obtain several environmental permits before significant construction or commencement of operations. Delays in obtaining permits or unanticipated conditions in such permits could delay the project or increase construction costs or operating expenses. Our manufacturing and recycling operations produce significant amounts of by-products, some of which are handled as industrial waste or hazardous waste. For example, our EAF mills generate electric arc furnace dust (""EAF dust""), which the EPA and other regulatory authorities classify as hazardous waste. EAF dust and other industrial waste and hazardous waste require special handling, recycling or disposal.In addition, the primary feed materials for the shredders operated by our recycling facilities are automobile hulks and obsolete household appliances. Approximately 20% of the weight of an automobile hull consists of material known as shredder fluff. After the segregation of ferrous and saleable nonferrous metals, shredder fluff remains. We, along with others in the recycling industry, interpret federal regulations to require shredder fluff to meet certain criteria and pass a toxic leaching test to avoid 18Table of Contentsclassification as a hazardous waste. We also endeavor to remove hazardous contaminants from the feed material prior to shredding. As a result, we believe the shredder fluff we generate is not normally considered or properly classified as hazardous waste. If the laws, regulations or testing methods change with regard to EAF dust or shredder fluff or other by-products, we may incur additional significant costs.Changes to National Ambient Air Quality Standards (""NAAQS"") or other requirements on our air emissions could make it more difficult to obtain new permits or to modify existing permits and could require changes to our operations or emissions control equipment. Such difficulties and changes could result in operational delays and capital and ongoing compliance expenditures.  These regulations can also increase our costs of energy, primarily electricity, which we use extensively in the steelmaking process. Moreover, in July 2021, the EPA issued a public statement regarding Clean Air Act violations at metal recycling facilities that operate auto and scrap metal shredders, noting that noncompliant shredders can have an impact on overburdened communities, and in August 2023, the EPA released federal enforcement priorities, which affirmed the EPA’s continued focus on reducing air toxins. The EPA uses alerts such as this to signal its intention to focus enforcement activity on a particular industry sector.Legal requirements are changing frequently and are subject to interpretation. New laws, regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities, together with uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels, testing and sampling procedures, new pollution control technology and cost/benefit analysis based on market conditions along with changing interpretations, stricter enforcement and expanding scope of regulation to emerging contaminants are all factors that may increase our future expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. Accordingly, we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of future compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. We cannot predict whether such costs would be able to be passed on to customers through product price increases. Competitors in various regions or countries where environmental regulation is less restrictive, subject to different interpretation or generally not enforced, may enjoy a competitive advantage.We may also be required to conduct additional cleanup (and pay for associated natural resource damages) at sites where we have already participated in remediation efforts or take remediation action with regard to sites formerly used in connection with our operations. We may be required to pay for a portion or all of the costs of cleanup or remediation at sites we never owned or on which we never operated if we are found to have arranged for treatment or disposal of hazardous substances on the sites. In cases of joint and several liability, we may be obligated to pay a disproportionate share of cleanup costs if other responsible parties are financially insolvent.Increased regulation associated with climate change could impose significant additional costs on both our steelmaking and metals recycling operations. Energy used by our steelmaking operations is a significant input and the largest contributor to our GHG emissions and there is growing belief that consumption of energy derived from fossil fuels is a major contributor to climate change. The U.S. government and various governmental agencies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impact of climate change, including legislation regarding carbon emission pricing, GHG emissions and renewable energy targets. International treaties or agreements may also result in increasing regulation of GHG emissions, including the introduction of carbon emissions trading mechanisms. Therefore, any such regulation regarding climate change and GHG emissions could impose significant costs on our steelmaking and metals recycling operations and on the operations of our customers and suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs in order to comply with current or future laws or regulations and limitations imposed on our operations. The potential costs of ""allowances,"" ""offsets"" or ""credits"" that may be part of potential cap-and-trade programs or similar future regulatory measures are still uncertain. Any adopted future climate change and GHG regulations could negatively impact our ability (and that of our customers and suppliers) to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. From a medium and long-term perspective, as a result of these regulatory initiatives, we may see an increase in costs relating to our assets that emit significant amounts of GHGs. Additionally, although we are focused on water conservation and reuse in our operations, steel manufacturing is a water intensive industry. There may be an increase in costs to respond to future water laws and regulations, and operations in areas with limited water availability may be impacted if droughts become more frequent or severe.Regulatory initiatives in these areas will be either voluntary or mandatory and may impact our operations directly or through our suppliers or customers. Until the timing, scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known, we cannot predict the effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, but such effect could be materially adverse to our business, results of operations and financial condition.19Table of ContentsWe are subject to governmental regulatory and compliance risks that expose us to potential litigation and disputes regarding violations, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  As noted above, existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, and future laws and regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See the risk factor ""Compliance with and changes in environmental laws and regulations and remediation requirements could result in substantially increased capital obligations and operating costs; violations of environmental laws and regulations could result in costs that have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition"" of this Annual Report for a description of such risks relating to environmental laws and regulations. In addition to such environmental laws and regulations, complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, including without limitation the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws in other countries, which generally prohibit companies and those acting on their behalf from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, regulations related to import-export controls, the Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions program and antiboycott provisions, may increase our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and expose us and our employees to elevated risk. While we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs, the nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist. A negative outcome in an unusual or significant legal proceeding or compliance investigation could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are involved, and may in the future become involved, in various environmental matters that may result in fines, penalties or judgments being assessed against us or liability imposed upon us which we cannot presently estimate or reasonably foresee, and which may have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Under CERCLA or similar state statutes, we may have obligations to conduct investigation and remediation activities associated with alleged releases of hazardous substances or to reimburse the EPA (or state agencies as applicable) for such activities and to pay for natural resource damages associated with alleged releases. We have been named a PRP at several federal and state Superfund sites because the EPA or an equivalent state agency contends that we and other potentially responsible scrap metal suppliers are liable for the cleanup of those sites as a result of having sold scrap metal to unrelated manufacturers for recycling as a raw material in the manufacture of new products. We are involved in litigation or administrative proceedings with regard to several of these sites in which we are contesting, or at the appropriate time may contest, our liability. In addition, we have received information requests with regard to other sites which may be under consideration by the EPA as potential CERCLA sites.We are presently participating in PRP organizations at several sites, which are paying for certain remediation expenses. Although we are unable to precisely estimate the ultimate dollar amount of exposure to loss in connection with various environmental matters or the effect on our consolidated financial position, we make accruals as warranted. In addition, although we do not believe that a reasonably possible range of loss in excess of amounts accrued for pending lawsuits, claims or proceedings would be material to our financial statements, additional developments may occur, and due to inherent uncertainties, including evolving remediation technology, changing regulations, possible third-party contributions, the inherent uncertainties of the estimation process, the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors, the amounts we ultimately are required to pay could vary significantly from the amounts we accrue, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Changes in tax legislation and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.We are subject to taxation at the federal, state and local levels in the U.S., Poland, the U.K. and other countries and jurisdictions in which we operate, including income taxes, sales taxes, value-added (“VAT”) taxes and similar taxes and assessments. New tax legislative initiatives may be proposed from time to time which may impact our effective tax rate and which could adversely affect our tax positions or tax liabilities. Our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by, among other things, changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes, changes in interpretations of existing tax laws, or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax. From time to time, U.S. federal, state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application, which could result in materially higher taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations"
12,CMC,COMMERCIAL METALS,2022-10-13,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSThere are inherent risks and uncertainties associated with our business that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Set forth below are descriptions of those risks and uncertainties that we currently believe to be material, but the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESSScrap and other inputs for our business are subject to significant price fluctuations and limited availability, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. At any given time, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of critical raw materials at a price and other terms acceptable to us. We depend on ferrous scrap, the primary raw material used by our steel mills, and other inputs such as graphite electrodes and alloys for our steel mill operations. The price of scrap and other inputs has historically been subject to significant fluctuation, and we may not be able to adjust our product prices to recover the costs of rapid increases in material prices, especially over the short-term and in our fixed price contracts. The profitability of our operations would be adversely affected if we are unable to pass increased raw material and input costs on to our customers.  The purchase prices for automobile bodies and various other grades of obsolete and industrial scrap, as well as the selling prices for processed and recycled scrap metals we utilize in our own manufacturing process or resell to others, are highly volatile. A prolonged period of low scrap prices or a fall in scrap prices could reduce our ability to obtain, process and sell recycled material, which could have a material adverse effect on our metals recycling operations business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices may be limited by competitive or other factors during periods of low scrap prices, when the supply of scrap may decline considerably, as scrap generators hold onto their scrap in the hope of getting higher prices later. Conversely, increased foreign demand for scrap due to economic expansion in countries such as China, India, Brazil and Turkey can result in an outflow of available domestic scrap as well as higher scrap prices that cannot always be passed on to domestic scrap consumers, further reducing the available domestic scrap flows and margins, all of which could adversely affect our sales and profitability. The availability of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations, allocations by suppliers, interruptions in production, accidents or natural disasters, changes in exchange rates, global price fluctuations and the availability and cost of transportation. If we were unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials, we may be unable to timely manufacture significant quantities of our products. We are vulnerable to the economic conditions in the regions in which our operations are concentrated.Economic downturns in the U.S. and Central Europe, or decisions by governments that have an impact on the level and pace of overall economic activity in one of these regions, could adversely affect demand for our products and, consequently, our sales and profitability. As a result, our financial results are substantially dependent upon the overall economic conditions in these areas.We rely on the availability of large amounts of electricity and natural gas. Disruptions in delivery or substantial increases in energy costs, including crude oil prices, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our EAF mills melt steel scrap in electric arc furnaces and use natural gas to heat steel billets for rolling into finished steel products. As large consumers of electricity and gas, often the largest in the geographic area where our mills are located, we must have dependable delivery of electricity and natural gas in order to operate. Accordingly, we are at risk in the event of an energy disruption. Prolonged black-outs or brown-outs or disruptions caused by natural disasters such as hurricanes would substantially disrupt our production. While we have not suffered prolonged production delays due to our inability to access electricity or natural gas, several of our competitors have experienced such occurrences. Prolonged substantial increases in energy costs would have an adverse effect on the costs of operating our mills and would negatively impact our profitability unless we were able to fully pass through the additional expense to our customers. Our finished steel products are typically delivered by truck. Rapid increases in the price of fuel attributable to increases in crude oil prices would increase our costs and adversely affect many of our customers' financial results, which in turn could result in reduced margins and declining demand for our products. 10Table of ContentsWe may encounter labor shortages for skilled labor and/or qualified employees in operational positions, which could adversely impact our operations.Our employees contribute to developing and meeting our business goals and objectives, and we depend on a qualified labor force for the manufacture of our products. The impact of  labor shortages and increased competition for available workers may increase our costs or impede our ability to optimally staff our facilities and could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, an ongoing labor shortage may result in increased expenses related to hiring and retention of qualified employees. As our experienced employees retire and we lose their institutional knowledge, we may encounter challenges and may have difficulty replacing them with employees of comparable skill and efficiency.The loss of, or inability to hire, key employees may adversely affect our ability to successfully manage our operations and meet our strategic objectives. Our future success depends, in large part, on the continued service of our officers and other key employees and our ability to continue to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel. These employees are integral to our success based on their expertise and knowledge of our business and products. We compete for such personnel with other companies, including public and private company competitors who may periodically offer more favorable terms of employment. The loss or interruption of the services of a number of our key employees could reduce our ability to effectively manage our operations due to the fact that we may not be able to find appropriate replacement personnel in a timely manner should the need arise.Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of inflation.Inflation has the potential to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations by increasing our overall cost structure, particularly if we are unable to achieve commensurate increases in the prices we charge our customers. Other inflationary pressures could affect wages, the cost and availability of components and raw materials and other inputs and our ability to meet customer demand. Inflation may further exacerbate other risk factors, including supply chain disruptions, risks related to international operations and the recruitment and retention of qualified employees.We may have difficulty competing with companies that have a lower cost structure or access to greater financial resources. We compete with regional, national and foreign manufacturers and traders. Consolidation among participants in the steel manufacturing and recycling industries has resulted in fewer competitors, and several of our competitors are significantly larger than us and have greater financial resources and more diverse businesses than us. Some of our foreign competitors may be able to pursue business opportunities without regard to certain laws and regulations with which we must comply, such as environmental regulations. These companies may have a lower cost structure and more operating flexibility, and consequently they may be able to offer better prices and more services than we can. There is no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with these companies. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our mills require continual capital investments that we may not be able to sustain. We must make regular substantial capital investments in our steel mills to maintain the mills, lower production costs and remain competitive. We cannot be certain that we will have sufficient internally generated cash or acceptable external financing to make necessary substantial capital expenditures in the future. The availability of external financing depends on many factors outside of our control, including capital market conditions and the overall performance of the economy. If funding is insufficient, we may be unable to develop or enhance our mills, take advantage of business opportunities and respond to competitive pressures.11Table of ContentsUnexpected equipment failures may lead to production curtailments or shutdowns, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Interruptions in our production capabilities would adversely affect our production costs, products available for sale and earnings for the affected period. Our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of steelmaking equipment, such as our furnaces, continuous casters and rolling equipment, as well as electrical equipment, such as transformers. This equipment may, on occasion, be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, material plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such equipment failures. In addition to equipment failures, our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, explosions or violent weather conditions.Operating and startup risks, as well as market risks associated with the commissioning of our third micro mill could prevent us from realizing anticipated benefits and could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our investment.Although we have successfully commissioned and operated similar technologies, there are some new technological, as well as operational, market and startup risks associated with the construction and commissioning of our third micro mill. We believe this facility should be capable of consistently producing high-quality products in sufficient quantities and at a cost that will compare favorably with other similar steel manufacturing facilities; however, there can be no assurance that these expectations will be achieved. If we encounter cost overruns, system or process difficulties during or after startup or quality control restrictions, our capital costs could increase materially, the expected benefits from the development of the facility could be diminished or lost and we could lose all or a substantial portion of our investment. We could also encounter commodity market risk if, during a sustained period, the cost to manufacture is greater than projected. Information technology interruptions and breaches in data security could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.We rely on computers, information and communications technology and related systems and networks in order to operate our business, including to store sensitive data such as intellectual property, our own proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners and personally identifiable information of our employees. Increased global information technology security requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and a rise in sophisticated and targeted cyber attacks, which may be heightened in times of hostilities or war, computer viruses, phishing attacks, social engineering schemes, malicious code, ransomware attacks, acts of terrorism and physical or electronic security breaches, including breaches by computer hackers, cyber-terrorists and/or unauthorized access to or disclosure of our and/or our employees’ or customers’ data pose a risk to the security of our systems, networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Our systems and networks are also subject to damage or interruption from power outages, natural disasters, telecommunications failures, intentional or inadvertent user misuse, employee error, operator negligence and other similar events. Any of these or other events could result in system interruption, the disclosure, modification or destruction of proprietary and other key information, corruption of data, legal claims or proceedings, government enforcement actions, civil or criminal penalties, increased cyber security protection and remediation costs, production delays or disruptions to operations including processing transactions and reporting financial results and could adversely impact our reputation and our operating results. We have taken steps to address these concerns and have implemented internal control and security measures to protect our systems and networks from security breaches; however, measures that the Company takes to avoid, detect, mitigate or recover from material incidents, may be insufficient, circumvented, or may become ineffective and there can be no assurance that a system or network failure, or security breach, will not impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. As cyber security threats continue to evolve and become more sophisticated, we may be required to incur significant costs and invest additional resources to protect against and, if required, remediate the damage caused by such disruptions or system failures in the future.Increasing attention to environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") matters, including any targets or other ESG or environmental justice initiatives, could result in additional costs or risks or adverse impacts on our business.Our business faces increasing scrutiny related to ESG issues, including environmental stewardship, supply chain management, climate change, diversity and inclusion, workplace conduct, human rights, philanthropy and support for local communities. Implementation of our environmental and sustainability initiatives, including the goals set forth in our annual sustainability report, may require certain financial expenditures and employee resources, and the implementation of certain ESG practices or disclosures. If we fail to meet applicable standards or expectations with respect to these issues, including the expectations we establish for our business, our reputation and brand could be damaged, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. Investors, stakeholders and other interested parties are also increasingly focused on issues related to environmental justice and ESG in general. This may result in increased scrutiny, protests and negative publicity with respect to our business and operations, which could in turn result in the cancellation or delay of projects, the revocation of 12Table of Contentspermits, termination of contracts, lawsuits, regulatory action and policy change that may adversely affect our business strategy, increase our costs, or adversely affect our reputation and performance.We are subject to litigation, potential liability claims and contract disputes, and may become subject to additional litigation, claims and disputes in the future, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are involved in various litigation matters, including regulatory proceedings, administrative proceedings, governmental investigations, environmental matters and construction contract disputes. The nature of our operations also exposes us to possible litigation claims in the future. Furthermore, the manufacture and sale of our products as well as the use of our products in a wide variety of commercial and industrial applications expose us to potential product liability and related claims. In the event that a product of ours fails to perform as expected, regardless of fault, or is used in an unexpected manner, and such failure or use results in, or is alleged to result in, bodily injury and/or property damage or other losses, we may be subject to product liability and product quality claims.Because of the uncertain nature of litigation and insurance coverage decisions, we cannot predict the outcome of these matters. These matters could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. Litigation is very costly, and the costs associated with prosecuting and defending litigation matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we are unable to precisely estimate the ultimate dollar amount of exposure to loss in connection with litigation matters, we make accruals as warranted. However, the amounts that we accrue could vary significantly from the amounts we actually pay, due to inherent uncertainties, including the inherent uncertainties of the estimation process, the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report for a description of our current material legal proceedings.Potential limitations on our ability to access credit, or the ability of our customers and suppliers to access credit, may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If our access to credit is limited or impaired, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. Our senior unsecured notes are rated by Standard & Poor's Corporation, Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Group, Inc. In determining our credit ratings, the rating agencies consider a number of both quantitative and qualitative factors. These factors include earnings (loss), fixed charges such as interest, cash flows, total debt outstanding, off-balance sheet obligations and other commitments, total capitalization and various ratios calculated from these factors. The rating agencies also consider predictability of cash flows, business strategy and diversity, industry conditions and contingencies. Any downgrades in our credit ratings may make raising capital more difficult, increase the cost and affect the terms of future borrowings, affect the terms under which we purchase goods and services and limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities. We could also be adversely affected if our banks refused to honor their contractual commitments or cease lending.We are also exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our customers and suppliers. In certain markets, we have experienced a consolidation among those entities to whom we sell. This consolidation has resulted in an increased credit risk spread among fewer customers, often without a corresponding strengthening of their financial status. If the availability of credit to fund or support the continuation and expansion of our customers' business operations is curtailed or if the cost of that credit is increased, the resulting inability of our customers or of their customers to either access credit or absorb the increased cost of that credit could adversely affect our business by reducing our sales or by increasing our exposure to losses from uncollectible customer accounts. The consequences of such adverse effects could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers, the reduction, delay or cancellation of customer orders, delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase and bankruptcy of customers, suppliers or other creditors. Any of these events may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.13Table of ContentsThe impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on the global economy, energy supplies and raw materials is uncertain, but may prove to negatively impact our business and operations.The short and long-term implications of Russia's invasion of Ukraine are difficult to predict at this time. We continue to monitor any adverse impact that the outbreak of war in Ukraine and the subsequent institution of sanctions against Russia by the United States and several European and Asian countries may have on the global economy in general, on our business and operations and on the businesses and operations of our suppliers and customers. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has led to market disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices and credit markets, as well as supply chain interruptions, and contributed to global inflation. Further, if the conflict intensifies or expands beyond Ukraine, it could have an adverse impact on our operations in Poland. We will continue to monitor this fluid situation and develop contingency plans as necessary to address any disruptions to our business operations as they develop. To the extent the war in Ukraine may adversely affect our business as discussed above, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors
” section, such as those relating to data security, supply chain, volatility in prices of scrap and other inputs, and market conditions, any of which could negatively affect our business and financial condition.The potential impact of our customers' non-compliance with existing commercial contracts and commitments, due to insolvency or for any other reason, may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.From time to time in the past, some of our customers have sought to renegotiate or cancel their existing purchase commitments with us. In addition, some of our customers have breached previously agreed upon contracts to buy our products by refusing delivery of the products. Where appropriate, we have and expect to in the future pursue litigation to recover our damages resulting from customer contract defaults and bankruptcy filings. We use credit assessments in the U.S. and credit insurance in Poland to mitigate the risk of customer insolvency. However, a large number of our customers defaulting on existing contractual obligations to purchase our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.The agreements governing our notes and our other debt contain financial covenants and impose restrictions on our business. The indentures governing our 4.875% Senior Notes due 2023, our 4.125% Senior Notes due 2030, our 3.875% Senior Notes due 2031 and our 4.375% Senior Notes due 2032 contain restrictions on our ability to create liens, sell assets, enter into sale and leaseback transactions and consummate transactions causing a change of control such as a merger or consolidation. In addition to these restrictions, our Credit Agreement, as defined in Note 9, Credit Arrangements, in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, contains covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things, enter into transactions with affiliates and guarantee the debt of some of our subsidiaries. Our Credit Agreement and U.S. Facility, as defined in Note 9, Credit Arrangements, in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report also require that we meet certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios, including maximum debt to capitalization and interest coverage ratios. The loan agreement related to the Series 2022 Bonds, as defined in Note 9, Credit Arrangements, in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, also restricts our ability to, among other things, enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions, incur certain liens and take certain actions that would adversely affect the tax-exempt status of the Series 2022 Bonds.Other agreements that we may enter into in the future may contain covenants imposing significant restrictions on our business that are similar to, or in addition to, the covenants under our existing agreements. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. The breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the indentures governing our notes or under our other debt agreements. An event of default under our debt agreements would permit our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If we were unable to repay debt to our secured lenders or if we incur additional secured debt in the future, these lenders could proceed against the collateral securing such debt. In addition, acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on our notes.14Table of ContentsWe may not be able to successfully identify, consummate or integrate acquisitions, and acquisitions may adversely affect our financial leverage. Part of our business strategy includes pursuing synergistic acquisitions. We have expanded, and plan to continue to expand, our business by making strategic acquisitions and regularly seeking suitable acquisition targets to enhance our growth. We may fund such acquisitions using cash on hand, drawing under our credit facility or accessing the capital markets. To the extent we finance such acquisitions with additional debt, the incurrence of such debt may result in a significant increase in our interest expense and financial leverage, which could be further exacerbated by volatility in the debt capital markets. Further, an increase in our leverage could lead to deterioration in our credit ratings.The pursuit of acquisitions may pose certain risks to us. We may not be able to identify acquisition candidates that fit our criteria for growth and profitability. Even if we are able to identify such candidates, we may not be able to acquire them on terms or financing satisfactory to us. We will incur expenses and dedicate attention and resources associated with the review of acquisition opportunities, whether or not we consummate such acquisitions. Additionally, even if we are able to acquire suitable targets on agreeable terms, we may not be able to successfully integrate their operations with ours. Achieving the anticipated benefits of any acquisition will depend in significant part upon whether we integrate such acquired businesses in an efficient and effective manner. We may not be able to achieve the anticipated operating and cost synergies or long-term strategic benefits of our acquisitions within the anticipated timing or at all. For example, elimination of duplicative costs may not be fully achieved or may take longer than anticipated. The benefits from any acquisition may be offset by the costs incurred in integrating the businesses and operations. We may also assume liabilities in connection with acquisitions to which we would not otherwise be exposed. An inability to realize any or all of the anticipated synergies or other benefits of an acquisition as well as any delays that may be encountered in the integration process, which may delay the timing of such synergies or other benefits, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charges in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We review the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets annually as of the first day of our fourth quarter, and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, or an indefinite lived intangible asset may not be recoverable. To evaluate goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment, we may use qualitative assessments to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, or an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. The qualitative assessments require assumptions to be made regarding multiple factors, including the current operating environment, historical and future financial performance and industry and market conditions. If an initial qualitative assessment identifies that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, additional quantitative testing is performed. Alternatively, the Company may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and instead perform a quantitative impairment test to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit in comparison to its associated carrying value.The quantitative impairment tests require us to make an estimate of the fair value of our reporting units. An impairment could be recorded as a result of changes in assumptions, estimates or circumstances, some of which are beyond our control. Factors which could result in an impairment include, but are not limited to: (i) reduced demand for our products; (ii) our cost of capital; (iii) higher material prices; (iv) slower growth rates in our industry; and (v) changes in the market based discount rates. Since a number of factors may influence determinations of fair value of goodwill, we are unable to predict whether impairments of goodwill will occur in the future, and there can be no assurance that continued conditions will not result in future impairments of goodwill. The future occurrence of a potential indicator of impairment could include matters such as (i) a decrease in expected net earnings; (ii) adverse equity market conditions; (iii) a decline in current market multiples; (iv) a decline in our common stock price; (v) a significant adverse change in legal factors or the general business climate; (vi) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; (vii) a significant downturn in residential or non-residential construction markets in the U.S.; and (viii) levels of imported steel into the U.S. Any such impairment would result in us recognizing a non-cash charge in our consolidated statements of earnings, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 15Table of ContentsImpairment of long-lived assets in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We have a significant amount of property, plant and equipment, finite-lived intangible assets and right of use assets that may be subject to impairment testing. Long-lived assets are subject to an impairment assessment when certain triggering events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may be impaired. If the net carrying value of the asset or group of assets exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows of the operations related to the asset, the excess of the net carrying value over estimated fair value is charged to impairment loss in the consolidated statements of earnings. The primary factors that affect estimates of future cash flows for these long-lived asset groups are (i) management's raw material price outlook; (ii) market demand; (iii) working capital changes; (iv) capital expenditures; and (v) selling, general and administrative expenses. There can be no assurance that continued market conditions, demand for our products, facility utilization levels or other factors will not result in future impairment charges.Competition from other materials may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In many applications, steel competes with other materials, such as aluminum and plastics (particularly in the automobile industry), cement, composites, glass and wood. Increased use of, or additional substitutes for, steel products could adversely affect future market prices and demand for steel products.Our operations present significant risk of injury or death. The industrial activities conducted at our facilities present significant risk of serious injury or death to our employees, customers or other visitors to our operations. Notwithstanding our safety precautions, including our material compliance with federal, state and local employee health and safety regulations, we may be unable to avoid material liabilities for injuries or deaths. We maintain workers' compensation insurance to address the risk of incurring material liabilities for injuries or deaths, but there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage will be adequate or will continue to be available on the terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could result in material liabilities to us for any injuries or deaths.Our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and stock price may be adversely affected by global public health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic.Pandemics, epidemics, widespread illness or other health issues, including the COVID-19 pandemic (""COVID-19""), that interfere with the ability of our employees, suppliers, customers, financing sources or others to conduct business, or negatively affect consumer confidence or the global economy, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and stock price.Despite the limited impact of COVID-19 on our operations to date, a resurgence of COVID-19 or any other public health crisis may negatively impact our operations, supply chain, transportation networks and customers, which may compress our margins, including as a result of preventative and precautionary measures that we, other businesses and governments are taking. Any economic downturn resulting from the widespread public health impacts of COVID-19 or any future pandemic could adversely affect demand for our products and contribute to volatile supply and demand conditions affecting prices and volumes in the markets for our products and raw materials. Given the dynamic and uncertain nature and duration of COVID-19 and related variants, and the effectiveness of actions globally to contain or mitigate its effects and the possibility of future pandemics, we cannot reasonably estimate the long-term impact of COVID-19 or any future public health threat on our business, results of operations and overall financial performance at this time.16Table of ContentsFluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar, including, in particular, the increased strength of the U.S. dollar as compared to Turkey's lira, China's renminbi or the euro, may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. A strong U.S. dollar makes imported metal products less expensive, resulting in more imports of steel products into the U.S. by our foreign competitors, while a weak U.S. dollar may have the opposite impact on imports. With the exception of exports of nonferrous scrap metal by the recycling facilities in our North America segment, we have not recently been a significant exporter of metal products. Economic difficulties in some large steel-producing regions of the world, resulting in lower local demand for steel products, have historically encouraged greater steel exports to the U.S. at depressed prices which can be exacerbated by a strong U.S. dollar. As a result, our products that are made in the U.S. may become relatively more expensive as compared to imported steel, which has had, and in the future could have, a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Operating internationally carries risks and uncertainties which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have significant facilities in Poland. Our vertically integrated network of operations located in Poland generated approximately 18% of 2022 consolidated net sales. Our stability, growth and profitability are subject to a number of risks inherent in doing business internationally in addition to the currency exchange risk and operating risks discussed above, including:•political, military, terrorist or major pandemic events;•local labor and social issues;•legal and regulatory requirements or limitations imposed by foreign governments (particularly those with significant steel consumption or steel-related production including Turkey, China, Brazil, Russia and India), including quotas, tariffs or other protectionist trade barriers, adverse tax law changes, nationalization or currency restrictions;•disruptions or delays in shipments caused by customs compliance or government agencies; and •potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations.These factors may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Hedging transactions may expose us to losses or limit our potential gains. Our product lines and global operations expose us to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. As part of our risk management program, we sometimes use financial instruments, including metals commodity futures, natural gas, electricity and other energy forward contracts, freight forward contracts, foreign currency exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts. While intended to reduce the effects of fluctuations in these prices and rates, these transactions may limit our potential gains or expose us to losses. If our counterparties to such transactions or the sponsors of the exchanges through which these transactions are offered, such as the London Metal Exchange, fail to honor their obligations due to financial distress, we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipated gains from these transactions.We enter into the foreign currency exchange forward contracts as economic hedges of trade commitments or anticipated commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency to mitigate the effects of changes in currency rates. These foreign exchange commitments are dependent on timely performance by our counterparties. Their failure to perform could result in our having to close these hedges without the anticipated underlying transaction and could result in losses if foreign currency exchange rates have changed.There can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares of our common stock at all or in any particular amounts.The stock markets in general have experienced substantial price and trading fluctuations, which have resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities that often are unrelated or disproportionate to changes in operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Price volatility over a given period may also cause the average price at which we repurchase our own common stock to exceed the stock's price at a given point in time. In addition, significant changes in the trading price of our common stock and our ability to access capital on terms favorable to us could impact our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock. The timing and amount of any repurchases will be determined by 17Table of Contentsthe Company's management based on its evaluation of market conditions, capital allocation alternatives and other factors beyond our control. Our share repurchase program may be modified, suspended, extended or terminated by the Company at any time and without notice. See Note 16, Capital Stock, in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information on our share repurchase program.RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRYOur industry and the industries we serve are vulnerable to global economic conditions. Metals industries and commodity products have historically been vulnerable to significant declines in consumption, global overcapacity and depressed product pricing during prolonged periods of economic downturn. Our business supports cyclical industries such as commercial, government and residential construction, energy, metals service center, petrochemical and original equipment manufacturing. We may experience significant fluctuations in demand for our products from these industries based on global or regional economic conditions, energy prices, consumer demand and decisions by governments to fund infrastructure projects such as highways, schools, energy plants and airports. Commercial and infrastructure construction activities related to the residential housing market, such as shopping centers, schools and roads, could be adversely impacted by a prolonged slump in new housing construction. Our business, results of operations and financial condition are adversely affected when the industries we serve suffer a prolonged downturn or anemic growth. Because we do not have unlimited backlogs, our business, results of operations and financial condition are promptly affected by short-term economic fluctuations.We are unable to predict the duration of current economic conditions that are contributing to current demand for our products. Future economic downturns or a prolonged period of slow growth or economic stagnation could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Excess capacity and over-production by foreign producers in the steel industry as well as the startup of new steelmaking capacity in the U.S. could result in lower domestic steel prices, which would adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability. Global steelmaking capacity exceeds demand for steel products in some regions around the world. Rather than reducing employment by rationalizing capacity with consumption, steel manufacturers in these countries (often with local government assistance or subsidies in various forms) have traditionally periodically exported steel at prices significantly below their home market prices, which prices may not reflect their costs of production or capital. For example, steel production in China, the world's largest producer and consumer of steel, has continued to exceed Chinese demand. This excess capacity in China has resulted in a further increase in imports of artificially low-priced steel and steel products to the U.S. and world steel markets. A continuation of this trend or a significant decrease in China's rate of economic expansion could result in increasing steel imports from China. Excessive imports of steel into the U.S. have exerted, and may continue to exert, downward pressure on U.S. steel prices, which negatively affects our ability to increase our sales, margins and profitability. The excess capacity may create downward pressure on our steel prices and lead to reduced sales volumes as imports absorb market share that would otherwise be filled by domestic supply, all of which would adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability and could subject us to possible renegotiation of contracts or increases in bad debt. Excess capacity has also led to greater protectionism as is evident in raw material and finished product border tariffs put in place by China, Brazil and other countries. We believe the downward pressure on, and periodically depressed levels of, U.S. steel prices in some recent years have been further exacerbated by imports of steel involving dumping and subsidy abuses by foreign steel producers. While some tariffs and quotas are periodically put into effect for certain steel products imported from a number of countries that have been found to have been unfairly pricing steel imports to the U.S., there is no assurance that tariffs and quotas will always be levied, even if otherwise justified, and even when imposed many of these are short-lived or ineffective. On March 8, 2018, the President signed a proclamation imposing a 25% tariff or quota limits on all imported steel products for an indefinite period of time under Section 232. The tariff or quota limits are imposed on all steel imports with the exception of steel imports originating from Australia, Canada and Mexico. During fiscal 2022, the current administration converted the tariff on steel imports from the European Union, United Kingdom and Japan to a tariff rate quota. When the Section 232 or other import tariffs, quotas or duties expire or if others are further relaxed or repealed, or if relatively higher U.S. steel prices make it attractive for foreign steelmakers to export their steel products to the U.S., despite the presence of import tariffs, quotas or duties, the resurgence of substantial imports of foreign steel could create downward pressure on U.S. steel prices.The adverse effects of excess capacity and over-production by foreign producers could be exacerbated by the startup of new steelmaking capacity in the U.S. Any of these adverse effects could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.18Table of ContentsRapid and significant changes in the price of metals could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Prices for most metals in which we deal have experienced increased volatility over the last several years, and such increased price volatility impacts us in several ways. While our downstream products may benefit from metal margin expansion as rapidly decreasing input costs for previously contracted fixed price work declines, our steel products would likely experience reduced metal margin and may be forced to liquidate high-cost inventory at reduced metal margins or losses until prices stabilize. Sudden increases in input costs could have the opposite effect in each case. Overall, we believe that rapid substantial price changes are not to our industry's benefit. Our customer and supplier base would be impacted due to uncertainty as to future prices. A reluctance to purchase inventory in the face of extreme price decreases or to sell quickly during a period of rapid price increases would likely reduce our volume of business. Marginal industry participants or speculators may attempt to participate to an unhealthy extent during a period of rapid price escalation with a substantial risk of contract default if prices suddenly reverse. Risks of default in contract performance by customers or suppliers as well as an increased risk of bad debts and customer credit exposure could increase during periods of rapid and substantial price changes.Physical impacts of climate change could have a material adverse effect on our costs and operations.The physical impacts of climate change may result in, among other things, increasing temperatures and an increase in extreme weather events such as droughts, wildfires, thunderstorms, snow or ice storms, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes and rising sea levels. Extreme weather conditions and natural disasters may increase our costs, limit the availability of materials, cause damage to our facilities or result in a prolonged disruption to our operations, and any damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. Many of our facilities are located near coastal areas or waterways where rising sea levels or flooding could disrupt our operations or adversely impact our facilities. Additionally, one of our existing micro mills as well as our micro mill currently under construction are located in an arid desert climate, where drought may restrict available water supplies and increase the risk of wildfires. Furthermore, major changes in weather patterns, periods of extended inclement weather or associated flooding may inhibit construction activity utilizing our products, result in project cancellations, delay or hinder shipments of our products to customers or reduce scrap metal inflows to our recycling facilities or disrupt the availability of electricity to our facilities. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on our costs or results of operations. RISKS RELATED TO THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTCompliance with and changes in environmental compliance requirements and remediation requirements could result in substantially increased capital obligations and operating costs; violations of environmental requirements could result in costs that have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Existing environmental laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, and future laws and regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is a significant factor in our business. We are subject to local, state, federal and international environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other matters, waste disposal, air emissions, waste and storm water effluent and disposal and employee health. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may seek injunctive relief impacting continuing operations for non-compliance with environmental requirements. New facilities that we may build, especially steel mills, are required to obtain several environmental permits before significant construction or commencement of operations. Delays in obtaining permits or unanticipated conditions in such permits could delay the project or increase construction costs or operating expenses. Our manufacturing and recycling operations produce significant amounts of by-products, some of which are handled as industrial waste or hazardous waste. For example, our EAF mills generate electric arc furnace dust (""EAF dust""), which the EPA and other regulatory authorities classify as hazardous waste. EAF dust and other industrial waste and hazardous waste require special handling, recycling or disposal.In addition, the primary feed materials for the shredders operated by our recycling facilities are automobile hulks and obsolete household appliances. Approximately 20% of the weight of an automobile hull consists of material known as shredder fluff. After the segregation of ferrous and saleable nonferrous metals, shredder fluff remains. We, along with others in the recycling industry, interpret federal regulations to require shredder fluff to meet certain criteria and pass a toxic leaching test to avoid classification as a hazardous waste. We also endeavor to remove hazardous contaminants from the feed material prior to shredding. As a result, we believe the shredder fluff we generate is not normally considered or properly classified as hazardous 19Table of Contentswaste. If the laws, regulations or testing methods change with regard to EAF dust or shredder fluff or other by-products, we may incur additional significant costs.Changes to National Ambient Air Quality Standards (""NAAQS"") or other requirements on our air emissions could make it more difficult to obtain new permits or to modify existing permits and could require changes to our operations or emissions control equipment. Such difficulties and changes could result in operational delays and capital and ongoing compliance expenditures. These regulations can also increase our costs of energy, primarily electricity, which we use extensively in the steelmaking process. Moreover, in July 2021, the EPA issued a public statement regarding Clean Air Act violations at metal recycling facilities that operate auto and scrap metal shredders, noting that noncompliant shredders can have an impact on overburdened communities. The EPA uses alerts such as this to signal its intention to focus enforcement activity on a particular industry sector.Legal requirements are changing frequently and are subject to interpretation. New laws, regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities, together with uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels, testing and sampling procedures, new pollution control technology and cost/benefit analysis based on market conditions along with changing interpretations, stricter enforcement and expanding scope of regulation to emerging contaminants are all factors that may increase our future expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. Accordingly, we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of future compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. We cannot predict whether such costs would be able to be passed on to customers through product price increases. Competitors in various regions or countries where environmental regulation is less restrictive, subject to different interpretation or generally not enforced, may enjoy a competitive advantage.We may also be required to conduct additional cleanup (and pay for associated natural resource damages) at sites where we have already participated in remediation efforts or take remediation action with regard to sites formerly used in connection with our operations. We may be required to pay for a portion or all of the costs of cleanup or remediation at sites we never owned or on which we never operated if we are found to have arranged for treatment or disposal of hazardous substances on the sites. In cases of joint and several liability, we may be obligated to pay a disproportionate share of cleanup costs if other responsible parties are financially insolvent.Increased regulation associated with climate change could impose significant additional costs on both our steelmaking and metals recycling operations. Energy used by our steelmaking operations is a significant input and the largest contributor to our greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions and there is growing belief that consumption of energy derived from fossil fuels is a major contributor to climate change. The U.S. government and various governmental agencies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impact of climate change, including legislation regarding carbon emission pricing, GHG emissions and renewable energy targets. International treaties or agreements may also result in increasing regulation of GHG emissions, including the introduction of carbon emissions trading mechanisms. Therefore, any such regulation regarding climate change and GHG emissions could impose significant costs on our steelmaking and metals recycling operations and on the operations of our customers and suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs in order to comply with current or future laws or regulations and limitations imposed on our operations. The potential costs of ""allowances,"" ""offsets"" or ""credits"" that may be part of potential cap-and-trade programs or similar future regulatory measures are still uncertain. Any adopted future climate change and GHG regulations could negatively impact our ability (and that of our customers and suppliers) to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. From a medium and long-term perspective, as a result of these regulatory initiatives, we may see an increase in costs relating to our assets that emit significant amounts of GHGs. Additionally, although we are focused on water conservation and reuse in our operations, steel manufacturing is a water intensive industry. There may be an increase in costs to respond to future water laws and regulations, and operations in areas with limited water availability may be impacted if droughts become more frequent or severe.Regulatory initiatives in these areas will be either voluntary or mandatory and may impact our operations directly or through our suppliers or customers. Until the timing, scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known, we cannot predict the effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, but such effect could be materially adverse to our business, results of operations and financial condition.20Table of ContentsWe are subject to governmental regulatory and compliance risks that expose us to potential litigation and disputes regarding violations, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  As noted above, existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, and future laws and regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See the risk factor ""Compliance with and changes in environmental compliance requirements and remediation requirements could result in substantially increased capital obligations and operating costs; violations of environmental requirements could result in costs that have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition"" of this Annual Report for a description of such risks relating to environmental laws and regulations. In addition to such environmental laws and regulations, complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, including without limitation the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws in other countries, which generally prohibit companies and those acting on their behalf from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, regulations related to import-export controls, the Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions program and antiboycott provisions, may increase our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and expose us and our employees to elevated risk. While we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs, the nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist. A negative outcome in an unusual or significant legal proceeding or compliance investigation could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are involved, and may in the future become involved, in various environmental matters that may result in fines, penalties or judgments being assessed against us or liability imposed upon us which we cannot presently estimate or reasonably foresee, and which may have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Under CERCLA or similar state statutes, we may have obligations to conduct investigation and remediation activities associated with alleged releases of hazardous substances or to reimburse the EPA (or state agencies as applicable) for such activities and to pay for natural resource damages associated with alleged releases. We have been named a PRP at several federal and state Superfund sites because the EPA or an equivalent state agency contends that we and other potentially responsible scrap metal suppliers are liable for the cleanup of those sites as a result of having sold scrap metal to unrelated manufacturers for recycling as a raw material in the manufacture of new products. We are involved in litigation or administrative proceedings with regard to several of these sites in which we are contesting, or at the appropriate time may contest, our liability. In addition, we have received information requests with regard to other sites which may be under consideration by the EPA as potential CERCLA sites.We are presently participating in PRP organizations at several sites, which are paying for certain remediation expenses. Although we are unable to precisely estimate the ultimate dollar amount of exposure to loss in connection with various environmental matters or the effect on our consolidated financial position, we make accruals as warranted. In addition, although we do not believe that a reasonably possible range of loss in excess of amounts accrued for pending lawsuits, claims or proceedings would be material to our financial statements, additional developments may occur, and due to inherent uncertainties, including evolving remediation technology, changing regulations, possible third-party contributions, the inherent uncertainties of the estimation process, the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors, the amounts we ultimately are required to pay could vary significantly from the amounts we accrue, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Changes in tax legislation and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect our results of operations.We are subject to taxation at the federal, state and local levels in the U.S., Poland and other countries and jurisdictions in which we operate, including income taxes, sales taxes, value-added (“VAT”) taxes and similar taxes and assessments. New tax legislative initiatives may be proposed from time to time which may impact our effective tax rate and which could adversely affect our tax positions or tax liabilities. Our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by, among other things, changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes, changes in interpretations of existing tax laws, or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax. From time to time, U.S. federal, state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application, which could result in materially higher taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations"
8,CMC,COMMERCIAL METALS,2021-10-14,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSThere are inherent risks and uncertainties associated with our business that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Set forth below are descriptions of those risks and uncertainties that we currently believe to be material, but the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESSWe are vulnerable to the economic conditions in the regions in which our operations are concentrated.Economic downturns in the U.S. and Central Europe, or decisions by governments that have an impact on the level and pace of overall economic activity in one of these regions, could adversely affect demand for our products and, consequently, our sales and profitability. As a result, our financial results are substantially dependent upon the overall economic conditions in these areas.Potential limitations on our ability to access credit, or the ability of our customers and suppliers to access credit, may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If our access to credit is limited or impaired, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. Our senior unsecured debt is rated by Standard & Poor's Corporation, Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Group, Inc. In determining our credit ratings, the rating agencies consider a number of both quantitative and qualitative factors. These factors include earnings (loss), fixed charges such as interest, cash flows, total debt outstanding, off-balance sheet obligations and other commitments, total capitalization and various ratios calculated from these factors. The rating agencies also consider predictability of cash flows, business strategy and diversity, industry conditions and contingencies. Any downgrades in our credit ratings may make raising capital more difficult, increase the cost and affect the terms of future borrowings, affect the terms under which we purchase goods and services and limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities. We could also be adversely affected if our banks refused to honor their contractual commitments or cease lending.We are also exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our customers and suppliers. In certain markets, we have experienced a consolidation among those entities to whom we sell. This consolidation has resulted in an increased credit risk spread among fewer customers, often without a corresponding strengthening of their financial status. If the availability of credit to fund or support the continuation and expansion of our customers' business operations is curtailed or if the cost of that credit is increased, the resulting inability of our customers or of their customers to either access credit or absorb the increased cost of that credit could adversely affect our business by reducing our sales or by increasing our exposure to losses from uncollectible 8customer accounts. The consequences of such adverse effects could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers, the reduction, delay or cancellation of customer orders, delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase and bankruptcy of customers, suppliers or other creditors. Any of these events may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.The potential impact of our customers' non-compliance with existing commercial contracts and commitments, due to insolvency or for any other reason, may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.From time to time in the past, some of our customers have sought to renegotiate or cancel their existing purchase commitments with us. In addition, some of our customers have breached previously agreed upon contracts to buy our products by refusing delivery of the products. Where appropriate, we have and expect to in the future pursue litigation to recover our damages resulting from customer contract defaults and bankruptcy filings. We use credit assessments in the U.S. and credit insurance in Poland to mitigate the risk of customer insolvency. However, a large number of our customers defaulting on existing contractual obligations to purchase our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.The agreements governing our notes and our other debt contain financial covenants and impose restrictions on our business. The indentures governing our 4.875% senior notes due 2023, our 5.375% senior notes due 2027 and our 3.875% senior notes due 2031 contains restrictions on our ability to create liens, sell assets, enter into sale and leaseback transactions and consummate transactions causing a change of control such as a merger or consolidation. In addition to these restrictions, our credit facility contains covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things, enter into transactions with affiliates and guarantee the debt of some of our subsidiaries. Our Credit Agreement and U.S. Facility, as defined in Note 8, Credit Arrangements, in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, also require that we meet certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios, including maximum debt to capitalization and interest coverage ratios.Other agreements that we may enter into in the future may contain covenants imposing significant restrictions on our business that are similar to, or in addition to, the covenants under our existing agreements. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. The breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the indentures governing our notes or under our other debt agreements. An event of default under our debt agreements would permit our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If we were unable to repay debt to our secured lenders or if we incur secured debt in the future, these lenders could proceed against the collateral securing that debt. In addition, acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on our notes.We may not be able to successfully identify, consummate or integrate acquisitions, and acquisitions may adversely affect our financial leverage. Part of our business strategy includes pursuing synergistic acquisitions. We have expanded, and plan to continue to expand, our business by making strategic acquisitions and regularly seeking suitable acquisition targets to enhance our growth. We may fund such acquisitions using cash on hand, drawing under our credit facility or accessing the capital markets. To the extent we finance such acquisitions with additional debt, the incurrence of such debt may result in a significant increase in our interest expense and financial leverage, which could be further exacerbated by volatility in the debt capital markets. Further, an increase in our leverage could lead to deterioration in our credit ratings.The pursuit of acquisitions may pose certain risks to us. We may not be able to identify acquisition candidates that fit our criteria for growth and profitability. Even if we are able to identify such candidates, we may not be able to acquire them on terms or financing satisfactory to us. We will incur expenses and dedicate attention and resources associated with the review of acquisition opportunities, whether or not we consummate such acquisitions. Additionally, even if we are able to acquire suitable targets on agreeable terms, we may not be able to successfully integrate their operations with ours. Achieving the anticipated benefits of any acquisition will depend in significant part upon whether we integrate such acquired businesses in an efficient and effective manner. We may not be able to achieve the anticipated operating and cost synergies or long-term strategic benefits of our acquisitions within the anticipated timing or at all. For example, 9elimination of duplicative costs may not be fully achieved or may take longer than anticipated. The benefits from any acquisition will be offset by the costs incurred in integrating the businesses and operations. We may also assume liabilities in connection with acquisitions to which we would not otherwise be exposed. An inability to realize any or all of the anticipated synergies or other benefits of an acquisition as well as any delays that may be encountered in the integration process, which may delay the timing of such synergies or other benefits, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Goodwill impairment charges in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We review the recoverability of goodwill annually, as of the first day of our fourth quarter, and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable. The impairment tests require us to make an estimate of the fair value of our reporting units. An impairment could be recorded as a result of changes in assumptions, estimates or circumstances, some of which are beyond our control. Factors which could result in an impairment include, but are not limited to: (i) reduced demand for our products; (ii) our cost of capital; (iii) higher material prices; (iv) slower growth rates in our industry; and (v) changes in the market based discount rates. Since a number of factors may influence determinations of fair value of goodwill, we are unable to predict whether impairments of goodwill will occur in the future, and there can be no assurance that continued conditions will not result in future impairments of goodwill. The future occurrence of a potential indicator of impairment could include matters such as (i) a decrease in expected net earnings; (ii) adverse equity market conditions; (iii) a decline in current market multiples; (iv) a decline in our common stock price; (v) a significant adverse change in legal factors or the general business climate; (vi) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; (vii) a significant downturn in residential or non-residential construction markets in the U.S.; and (viii) levels of imported steel into the U.S. Any such impairment would result in us recognizing a non-cash charge in our consolidated statements of earnings, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Impairment of long-lived assets in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We have a significant amount of property, plant and equipment, finite-lived intangible assets and right of use assets that may be subject to impairment testing. Long-lived assets are subject to an impairment assessment when certain triggering events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may be impaired. If the net carrying value of the asset or group of assets exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows of the operations related to the asset, the excess of the net carrying value over estimated fair value is charged to impairment loss in the consolidated statements of earnings. The primary factors that affect estimates of future cash flows for these long-lived asset groups are (i) management's raw material price outlook; (ii) market demand; (iii) working capital changes; (iv) capital expenditures; and (v) selling, general and administrative expenses. There can be no assurance that continued market conditions, demand for our products, facility utilization levels or other factors will not result in future impairment charges.We have ceased operations at our Rancho Cucamonga facility and an adjacent rebar fabrication facility, and on September 29, 2021, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the assets associated with the facilities (the ""Rancho Cucamonga property"") for estimated gross proceeds of approximately $300 million. The Rancho Cucamonga property was classified as held for sale as of August 31, 2021. There is no assurance that we will be able to close the sale of the Rancho Cucamonga property in a timely manner or at all. Our inability to close the transaction in a timely manner may result in future impairment losses that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.10There can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares of our common stock at all or in any particular amounts.The stock markets in general have experienced substantial price and trading fluctuations, which have resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities that often are unrelated or disproportionate to changes in operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Price volatility over a given period may also cause the average price at which we repurchase our own common stock to exceed the stock's price at a given point in time. In addition, significant changes in the trading price of our common stock and our ability to access capital on terms favorable to us could impact our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock. The timing and amount of any repurchases will be determined by the Company's management based on its evaluation of market conditions, capital allocation alternatives and other factors beyond our control. Our share repurchase program may be modified, suspended, extended or terminated by the Company at any time and without notice. See Note 15, Capital Stock, in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, for additional information on our share repurchase program.Scrap and other inputs for our business are subject to significant price fluctuations and limited availability, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. At any given time, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of critical raw materials at a price and other terms acceptable to us. We depend on ferrous scrap, the primary raw material used by our steel mills, and other inputs such as graphite electrodes and ferroalloys for our steel mill operations. The price of scrap and other inputs has historically been subject to significant fluctuation, and we may not be able to adjust our product prices to recover the costs of rapid increases in material prices, especially over the short-term and in our fixed price contracts. The profitability of our operations would be adversely affected if we are unable to pass increased raw material and input costs on to our customers. Changing processes could potentially impact the volume of scrap metal available to us and the volume and realized margins of products we sell. The purchase prices for automobile bodies and various other grades of obsolete and industrial scrap, as well as the selling prices for processed and recycled scrap metals we utilize in our own manufacturing process or resell to others, are highly volatile. A prolonged period of low scrap prices or a fall in scrap prices could reduce our ability to obtain, process and sell recycled material, which could have a material adverse effect on our metals recycling operations business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices may be limited by competitive or other factors during periods of low scrap prices, when the supply of scrap may decline considerably, as scrap generators hold onto their scrap in the hope of getting higher prices later. Conversely, increased foreign demand for scrap due to economic expansion in countries such as China, India, Brazil and Turkey can result in an outflow of available domestic scrap as well as higher scrap prices that cannot always be passed on to domestic scrap consumers, further reducing the available domestic scrap flows and margins, all of which could adversely affect our sales and profitability. The availability of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations, allocations by suppliers, interruptions in production, accidents or natural disasters, changes in exchange rates, global price fluctuations, and the availability and cost of transportation. If we were unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials, we may be unable to timely manufacture significant quantities of our products. The loss of, or inability to hire, key employees may adversely affect our ability to successfully manage our operations and meet our strategic objectives. Our future success depends, in large part, on the continued service of our officers and other key employees and our ability to continue to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel. These employees are integral to our success based on their expertise and knowledge of our business and products. We compete for such personnel with other companies, including public and private company competitors who may periodically offer more favorable terms of employment. The loss or interruption of the services of a number of our key employees could reduce our ability to effectively manage our operations due to the fact that we may not be able to find appropriate replacement personnel in a timely manner should the need arise.11We may have difficulty competing with companies that have a lower cost structure or access to greater financial resources. We compete with regional, national and foreign manufacturers and traders. Consolidation among participants in the steel manufacturing and recycling industries has resulted in fewer competitors, and several of our competitors are significantly larger than us and have greater financial resources and more diverse businesses than us. Some of our foreign competitors may be able to pursue business opportunities without regard to certain laws and regulations with which we must comply, such as environmental regulations. These companies may have a lower cost structure and more operating flexibility, and consequently they may be able to offer better prices and more services than we can. There is no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with these companies. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Information technology interruptions and breaches in data security could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.We rely on computers, information and communications technology and related systems and networks in order to operate our business, including to store sensitive data such as intellectual property, our own proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners and personally identifiable information of our employees. Increased global information technology security requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and a rise in sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems, networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Our systems and networks are also subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, employee error and other similar events. Any of these or other events could result in system interruption, the disclosure, modification or destruction of proprietary and other key information, legal claims or proceedings, production delays or disruptions to operations including processing transactions and reporting financial results and could adversely impact our reputation and our operating results. We have taken steps to address these concerns and have implemented internal control and security measures to protect our systems and networks from security breaches; however, there can be no assurance that a system or network failure, or security breach, will not impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our mills require continual capital investments that we may not be able to sustain. We must make regular substantial capital investments in our steel mills to maintain the mills, lower production costs and remain competitive. We cannot be certain that we will have sufficient internally generated cash or acceptable external financing to make necessary substantial capital expenditures in the future. The availability of external financing depends on many factors outside of our control, including capital market conditions and the overall performance of the economy. If funding is insufficient, we may be unable to develop or enhance our mills, take advantage of business opportunities and respond to competitive pressures.Unexpected equipment failures may lead to production curtailments or shutdowns, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Interruptions in our production capabilities would adversely affect our production costs, products available for sale and earnings for the affected period. Our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of steel-making equipment, such as our furnaces, continuous casters and rolling equipment, as well as electrical equipment, such as transformers. This equipment may, on occasion, be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, material plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such equipment failures. In addition to equipment failures, our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, explosions or violent weather conditions.Competition from other materials may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In many applications, steel competes with other materials, such as aluminum and plastics (particularly in the automobile industry), cement, composites, glass and wood. Increased use of, or additional substitutes for, steel products could adversely affect future market prices and demand for steel products.12Hedging transactions may expose us to losses or limit our potential gains. Our product lines and global operations expose us to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. As part of our risk management program, we sometimes use financial instruments, including metals commodity futures, natural gas, electricity and other energy forward contracts, freight forward contracts, foreign currency exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts. While intended to reduce the effects of fluctuations in these prices and rates, these transactions may limit our potential gains or expose us to losses. If our counterparties to such transactions or the sponsors of the exchanges through which these transactions are offered, such as the London Metal Exchange, fail to honor their obligations due to financial distress, we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipated gains from these transactions.We enter into the foreign currency exchange forward contracts as economic hedges of trade commitments or anticipated commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency to mitigate the effects of changes in currency rates. These foreign exchange commitments are dependent on timely performance by our counterparties. Their failure to perform could result in our having to close these hedges without the anticipated underlying transaction and could result in losses if foreign currency exchange rates have changed.Our operations present significant risk of injury or death. The industrial activities conducted at our facilities present significant risk of serious injury or death to our employees, customers or other visitors to our operations, notwithstanding our safety precautions, including our material compliance with federal, state and local employee health and safety regulations, and we may be unable to avoid material liabilities for injuries or deaths. We maintain workers' compensation insurance to address the risk of incurring material liabilities for injuries or deaths, but there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage will be adequate or will continue to be available on the terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could result in material liabilities to us for any injuries or deaths.Our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and stock price may be adversely affected by global public health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic.Pandemics, epidemics, widespread illness or other health issues, including the COVID-19 pandemic (""COVID-19""), that interfere with the ability of our employees, suppliers, customers, financing sources or others to conduct business, or negatively affect consumer confidence or the global economy, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and stock price.Despite the limited impact to our operations in 2020 and 2021, COVID-19 may have negative impacts on our operations, supply chain, transportation networks and customers, which may compress our margins, including as a result of preventative and precautionary measures that we, other businesses and governments are taking. Any economic downturn resulting from the widespread public health impacts of COVID-19 could adversely affect demand for our products and contribute to volatile supply and demand conditions affecting prices and volumes in the markets for our products and raw materials. In addition, the ability of our suppliers and customers to work may be significantly impacted by individuals contracting or being exposed to COVID-19 or as a result of the control measures noted above, which may negatively impact our production throughout the supply chain and constrict sales channels. Our customers may be directly impacted by business interruptions or weak market conditions and may not be willing or able to fulfill their contractual obligations. Furthermore, the progression of and global response to COVID-19 increases the risk of delays in construction activities and equipment deliveries related to our capital projects, including potential delays in obtaining permits from government agencies. The extent of such delays and other effects of COVID-19 on our capital projects, certain of which are outside of our control, is unknown, but they could impact or delay the timing of anticipated benefits on capital projects. COVID-19 has also caused volatility in the financial and capital markets and may adversely affect our ability to access, and the costs associated with accessing, the debt or equity capital markets, which could adversely affect our liquidity.Given the dynamic and uncertain nature and duration of COVID-19 and related variants, and the effectiveness of actions globally to contain or mitigate its effects, we cannot reasonably estimate the long-term impact of COVID-19 on our business, results of operations and overall financial performance at this time.13Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar, including, in particular, the increased strength of the U.S. dollar as compared to Turkey's lira, China's renminbi or the euro, may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. A strong U.S. dollar makes imported metal products less expensive, resulting in more imports of steel products into the U.S. by our foreign competitors, while a weak U.S. dollar may have the opposite impact on imports. With the exception of exports of nonferrous scrap metal by the recycling facilities in our North America segment, we have not recently been a significant exporter of metal products. Economic difficulties in some large steel-producing regions of the world, resulting in lower local demand for steel products, have historically encouraged greater steel exports to the U.S. at depressed prices which can be exacerbated by a strong U.S. dollar. As a result, our products that are made in the U.S. may become relatively more expensive as compared to imported steel, which has had, and in the future could have, a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Operating internationally carries risks and uncertainties which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have significant facilities in Poland. Our Polish operations generated approximately 16% of 2021 consolidated net sales. Our stability, growth and profitability are subject to a number of risks inherent in doing business internationally in addition to the currency exchange risk and operating risks discussed above, including:•political, military, terrorist or major pandemic events;•local labor and social issues;•legal and regulatory requirements or limitations imposed by foreign governments (particularly those with significant steel consumption or steel-related production including Turkey, China, Brazil, Russia and India), including quotas, tariffs or other protectionist trade barriers, adverse tax law changes, nationalization or currency restrictions;•disruptions or delays in shipments caused by customs compliance or government agencies; and •potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations.These factors may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.We rely on the availability of large amounts of electricity and natural gas. Disruptions in delivery or substantial increases in energy costs, including crude oil prices, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our EAF mills melt steel scrap in electric arc furnaces and use natural gas to heat steel billets for rolling into finished steel products. As large consumers of electricity and gas, often the largest in the geographic area where our mills are located, we must have dependable delivery of electricity and natural gas in order to operate. Accordingly, we are at risk in the event of an energy disruption. Prolonged black-outs or brown-outs or disruptions caused by natural disasters such as hurricanes would substantially disrupt our production. While we have not suffered prolonged production delays due to our inability to access electricity or natural gas, several of our competitors have experienced such occurrences. Prolonged substantial increases in energy costs would have an adverse effect on the costs of operating our mills and would negatively impact our profitability unless we were able to fully pass through the additional expense to our customers. Our finished steel products are typically delivered by truck. Rapid increases in the price of fuel attributable to increases in crude oil prices would increase our costs and adversely affect many of our customers' financial results, which in turn could result in reduced margins and declining demand for our products. Operating and startup risks, as well as market risks associated with the commissioning of our third micro mill could prevent us from realizing anticipated benefits and could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our investment.Although we have successfully commissioned and operated similar technologies, there are some new technological, as well as operational, market and startup risks associated with the construction and startup of our third micro mill to be located in Mesa, Arizona. We believe this facility should be capable of consistently producing high-quality products, and in sufficient quantities and at a cost that will compare favorably with other similar steel manufacturing facilities; however, there can be no assurance that these expectations will be achieved. If we encounter cost overruns, system or process difficulties during or after startup or quality control restrictions, our capital costs could increase materially, the expected benefits from the development of the 14facility could be diminished or lost and we could lose all or a substantial portion of our investment. We could also encounter commodity market risk if, during a sustained period, the cost to manufacture is greater than projected. RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRYOur industry and the industries we serve are vulnerable to global economic conditions. Metals industries and commodity products have historically been vulnerable to significant declines in consumption, global overcapacity and depressed product pricing during prolonged periods of economic downturn. Our business supports cyclical industries such as commercial, government and residential construction, energy, metals service center, petrochemical and original equipment manufacturing. We may experience significant fluctuations in demand for our products from these industries based on global or regional economic conditions, energy prices, consumer demand and decisions by governments to fund infrastructure projects such as highways, schools, energy plants and airports. Commercial and infrastructure construction activities related to the residential housing market, such as shopping centers, schools and roads, could be adversely impacted by a prolonged slump in new housing construction. Our business, results of operations and financial condition are adversely affected when the industries we serve suffer a prolonged downturn or anemic growth. Because we do not have unlimited backlogs, our business, results of operations and financial condition are promptly affected by short-term economic fluctuations.Although we believe that the long-term prospects for the steel industry remain bright, we are unable to predict the duration of current economic conditions that are contributing to current demand for our products. Future economic downturns or a prolonged period of slow growth or economic stagnation could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Excess capacity and over-production by foreign producers in our industry as well as the startup of new steel-making capacity in the U.S. could result in lower domestic prices, which would adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability. Global steel-making capacity exceeds demand for steel products in some regions around the world. Rather than reducing employment by rationalizing capacity with consumption, steel manufacturers in these countries (often with local government assistance or subsidies in various forms) have traditionally periodically exported steel at prices significantly below their home market prices, which prices may not reflect their costs of production or capital. For example, steel production in China, the world's largest producer and consumer of steel, has continued to exceed Chinese demand. This rising excess capacity in China has resulted in a further increase in imports of artificially low-priced steel and steel products to the U.S. and world steel markets. A continuation of this trend or a significant decrease in China's rate of economic expansion could result in increasing steel imports from China. Excessive imports of steel into the U.S. have exerted, and may continue to exert, downward pressure on U.S. steel prices, which negatively affects our ability to increase our sales, margins and profitability. The excess capacity may create downward pressure on our steel prices and lead to reduced sales volumes as imports absorb market share that would otherwise be filled by domestic supply, all of which would adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability and could subject us to possible renegotiation of contracts or increases in bad debt. Excess capacity has also led to greater protectionism as is evident in raw material and finished product border tariffs put in place by China, Brazil and other countries. We believe the downward pressure on, and periodically depressed levels of, U.S. steel prices in some recent years have been further exacerbated by imports of steel involving dumping and subsidy abuses by foreign steel producers. While some tariffs and quotas are periodically put into effect for certain steel products imported from a number of countries that have been found to have been unfairly pricing steel imports to the U.S., there is no assurance that tariffs and quotas will always be levied, even if otherwise justified, and even when imposed many of these are short-lived or ineffective. On March 8, 2018, the President signed a proclamation imposing a 25% tariff or quota limits on all imported steel products for an indefinite period of time under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (""Section 232""). The tariff or quota limits are imposed on all steel imports with the exception of steel imports originating from Australia, Canada and Mexico, and the current administration is considering exemption requests from other countries. When this or other import tariffs, quotas or duties expire or if others are further relaxed or repealed, or if relatively higher U.S. steel prices make it attractive for foreign steelmakers to export their steel products to the U.S., despite the presence of import tariffs, quotas or duties, the resurgence of substantial imports of foreign steel could create downward pressure on U.S. steel prices.The adverse effects of excess capacity and over-production by foreign producers could be exacerbated by the startup of new steel-making capacity in the U.S. Any of these adverse effects could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.15Rapid and significant changes in the price of metals could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Prices for most metals in which we deal have experienced increased volatility over the last several years, and such increased price volatility impacts us in several ways. While our downstream products may benefit from metal margin expansion as rapidly decreasing input costs for previously contracted fixed price work declines, our steel products would likely experience reduced metal margin and may be forced to liquidate high cost inventory at reduced metal margins or losses until prices stabilize. Sudden increases in input costs could have the opposite effect in each case. Overall, we believe that rapid substantial price changes are not to our industry's benefit. Our customer and supplier base would be impacted due to uncertainty as to future prices. A reluctance to purchase inventory in the face of extreme price decreases or to sell quickly during a period of rapid price increases would likely reduce our volume of business. Marginal industry participants or speculators may attempt to participate to an unhealthy extent during a period of rapid price escalation with a substantial risk of contract default if prices suddenly reverse. Risks of default in contract performance by customers or suppliers as well as an increased risk of bad debts and customer credit exposure could increase during periods of rapid and substantial price changes.Physical impacts of climate change could have a material adverse effect on our costs and operations.There has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with rising sea levels as well as extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes, drought and snow or ice storms. Extreme weather conditions may increase our costs or cause damage to our facilities, and any damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. Many of our facilities are located near coastal areas or waterways where rising sea levels or flooding could disrupt our operations or adversely impact our facilities. Furthermore, periods of extended inclement weather or associated flooding may inhibit construction activity utilizing our products, delay or hinder shipments of our products to customers or reduce scrap metal inflows to our recycling facilities. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on our costs or results of operations.RISKS RELATED TO THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTCompliance with and changes in environmental compliance requirements and remediation requirements could result in substantially increased capital obligations and operating costs; violations of environmental requirements could result in costs that have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Existing environmental laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, and future laws and regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is a significant factor in our business. We are subject to local, state, federal and international environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other matters, waste disposal, air emissions, waste and storm water effluent and disposal and employee health. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may seek injunctive relief impacting continuing operations for non-compliance with environmental requirements. New facilities that we may build, especially steel mills, are required to obtain several environmental permits before significant construction or commencement of operations. Delays in obtaining permits or unanticipated conditions in such permits could delay the project or increase construction costs or operating expenses. Our manufacturing and recycling operations produce significant amounts of by-products, some of which are handled as industrial waste or hazardous waste. For example, our EAF mills generate electric arc furnace dust (""EAF dust""), which the EPA and other regulatory authorities classify as hazardous waste. EAF dust and other industrial waste and hazardous waste require special handling, recycling or disposal.In addition, the primary feed materials for the shredders operated by our recycling facilities are automobile hulks and obsolete household appliances. Approximately 20% of the weight of an automobile hull consists of unrecyclable material known as shredder fluff. After the segregation of ferrous and saleable nonferrous metals, shredder fluff remains. We, along with others in the recycling industry, interpret federal regulations to require shredder fluff to meet certain criteria and pass a toxic leaching test to avoid classification as a hazardous waste. We also endeavor to remove hazardous contaminants from the feed material prior to shredding. As a result, we believe the shredder fluff we generate is not normally considered or properly classified as hazardous waste. If the laws, regulations or testing methods change with regard to EAF dust or shredder fluff or other by-products, we may incur additional significant costs.Changes to National Ambient Air Quality Standards (""NAAQS"") or other requirements on our air emissions could make it more difficult to obtain new permits or to modify existing permits and could require changes to our operations or emissions control equipment. Such difficulties and changes could result in operational delays and capital and ongoing compliance expenditures.16Legal requirements are changing frequently and are subject to interpretation. New laws, regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities, together with uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels, testing and sampling procedures, new pollution control technology and cost/benefit analysis based on market conditions are all factors that may increase our future expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. Accordingly, we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of future compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. We cannot predict whether such costs would be able to be passed on to customers through product price increases. Competitors in various regions or countries where environmental regulation is less restrictive, subject to different interpretation or generally not enforced, may enjoy a competitive advantage.We may also be required to conduct additional cleanup (and pay for associated natural resource damages) at sites where we have already participated in remediation efforts or take remediation action with regard to sites formerly used in connection with our operations. We may be required to pay for a portion or all of the costs of cleanup or remediation at sites we never owned or on which we never operated if we are found to have arranged for treatment or disposal of hazardous substances on the sites. In cases of joint and several liability, we may be obligated to pay a disproportionate share of cleanup costs if other responsible parties are financially insolvent.Changes in tax legislation and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect our results of operations.We are subject to taxation at the federal, state and local levels in the U.S., Poland and other countries and jurisdictions in which we operate, including income taxes, sales taxes, value-added (“VAT”) taxes, and similar taxes and assessments. New tax legislative initiatives may be proposed from time to time which may impact our effective tax rate and which could adversely affect our tax positions or tax liabilities. Our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by, among other things, changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes, changes in interpretations of existing tax laws, or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax. From time to time, U.S. federal, state and local, and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application, which could result in materially higher taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.We are involved, and may in the future become involved, in various environmental matters that may result in fines, penalties or judgments being assessed against us or liability imposed upon us which we cannot presently estimate or reasonably foresee and which may have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Under CERCLA or similar state statutes, we may have obligations to conduct investigation and remediation activities associated with alleged releases of hazardous substances or to reimburse the EPA (or state agencies as applicable) for such activities and to pay for natural resource damages associated with alleged releases. We have been named a PRP at several federal and state Superfund sites because the EPA or an equivalent state agency contends that we and other potentially responsible scrap metal suppliers are liable for the cleanup of those sites as a result of having sold scrap metal to unrelated manufacturers for recycling as a raw material in the manufacture of new products. We are involved in litigation or administrative proceedings with regard to several of these sites in which we are contesting, or at the appropriate time may contest, our liability. In addition, we have received information requests with regard to other sites which may be under consideration by the EPA as potential CERCLA sites.We are presently participating in PRP organizations at several sites, which are paying for certain remediation expenses. Although we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure to loss in connection with various environmental matters or the effect on our consolidated financial position, we make accruals as warranted. In addition, although we do not believe that a reasonably possible range of loss in excess of amounts accrued for pending lawsuits, claims or proceedings would be material to our financial statements, additional developments may occur, and due to inherent uncertainties, including evolving remediation technology, changing regulations, possible third-party contributions, the inherent uncertainties of the estimation process, the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors, the amounts we ultimately are required to pay could vary significantly from the amounts we accrue, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Increased regulation associated with climate change could impose significant additional costs on both our steelmaking and metals recycling operations. Energy used by our steelmaking operations is a significant input and the largest contributor to our greenhouse gas (""GHG"") 17emissions and there is growing belief that consumption of energy derived from fossil fuels is a major contributor to climate change. The U.S. government and various governmental agencies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impact of climate change, including legislation regarding carbon emission pricing, GHG emissions and renewable energy targets. International treaties or agreements may also result in increasing regulation of GHG emissions, including the introduction of carbon emissions trading mechanisms. Therefore, any such regulation regarding climate change and GHG emissions could impose significant costs on our steelmaking and metals recycling operations and on the operations of our customers and suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs in order to comply with current or future laws or regulations and limitations imposed on our operations. The potential costs of ""allowances,"" ""offsets"" or ""credits"" that may be part of potential cap-and-trade programs or similar future regulatory measures are still uncertain. Any adopted future climate change and GHG regulations could negatively impact our ability (and that of our customers and suppliers) to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. From a medium and long-term perspective, as a result of these regulatory initiatives, we may see an increase in costs relating to our assets that emit significant amounts of GHGs. Additionally, although we are focused on water conservation and reuse in our operations, steel manufacturing is a water intensive industry. There may be an increase in costs to respond to future water laws and regulations, and operations in areas with limited water availability may be impacted if droughts become more frequent or severe.Regulatory initiatives in these areas will be either voluntary or mandatory and may impact our operations directly or through our suppliers or customers. Until the timing, scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known, we cannot predict the effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, but such effect could be materially adverse to our business, results of operations and financial condition.We are subject to litigation and legal compliance risks which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are involved in various litigation matters, including regulatory proceedings, administrative proceedings, governmental investigations, environmental matters and construction contract disputes. The nature of our operations also exposes us to possible litigation claims in the future. Because of the uncertain nature of litigation and insurance coverage decisions, we cannot predict the outcome of these matters. These matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Litigation is very costly, and the costs associated with prosecuting and defending litigation matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure to loss in connection with litigation matters, we make accruals as warranted. However, the amounts that we accrue could vary significantly from the amounts we actually pay, due to inherent uncertainties, including the inherent uncertainties of the estimation process, the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors. See Part I, Item 3, ""Legal Proceedings"" of this Annual Report, for a description of our current material legal proceedings.As noted above, existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, and future laws and regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See the risk factor ""Compliance with and changes in environmental compliance requirements and remediation requirements could result in substantially increased capital obligations and operating costs; violations of environmental requirements could result in costs that have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition"" of this Annual Report for a description of such risks relating to environmental laws and regulations. In addition to such environmental laws and regulations, complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, including without limitation the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws in other countries, which generally prohibit companies and those acting on their behalf from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, regulations related to import-export controls, the Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions program and antiboycott provisions, may increase our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and expose us and our employees to elevated risk. While we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs, the nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist. A negative outcome in an unusual or significant legal proceeding or compliance investigation could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition"
16,CMC,COMMERCIAL METALS,2020-10-15,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSThere are inherent risks and uncertainties associated with our business that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Set forth below are descriptions of those risks and uncertainties that we currently believe to be material, but the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRYOur industry and the industries we serve are vulnerable to global economic conditions. Metals industries and commodity products have historically been vulnerable to significant declines in consumption, global overcapacity and depressed product pricing during prolonged periods of economic downturn. Our business supports cyclical industries such as commercial, government and residential construction, energy, metals service center, petrochemical and original equipment manufacturing. We may experience significant fluctuations in demand for our products from these industries based on global or regional economic conditions, energy prices, consumer demand and decisions by governments to fund infrastructure projects such as highways, schools, energy plants and airports. Although the residential housing market is not a significant direct factor in our business, related commercial and infrastructure construction activities, such as shopping centers, schools and roads, could be adversely impacted by a prolonged slump in new housing construction. Our business, results of operations and financial condition are adversely affected when the industries we serve suffer a prolonged downturn or anemic growth. Because we do not have unlimited backlogs, our business, results of operations and financial condition are promptly affected by short-term economic fluctuations.Although we believe that the long-term prospects for the steel industry remain bright, we are unable to predict the duration of current economic conditions that are contributing to current demand for our products. Future economic downturns or a prolonged period of slow growth or economic stagnation could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.We are vulnerable to the economic conditions in the regions in which our operations are concentrated.Economic downturns in the U.S. and Central Europe, or decisions by governments that have an impact on the level and pace of overall economic activity in one of these regions, could adversely affect demand for our products and, consequently, our sales and profitability. As a result, our financial results are substantially dependent upon the overall economic conditions in these areas.Rapid and significant changes in the price of metals could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Prices for most metals in which we deal have experienced increased volatility over the last several years, and such increased price volatility impacts us in several ways. While our downstream products may benefit from metal margin expansion as rapidly decreasing input costs for previously contracted fixed price work declines, our steel products would likely experience reduced metal margin and may be forced to liquidate high cost inventory at reduced metal margins or losses until prices stabilize. Sudden increases in input costs could have the opposite effect in each case. Overall, we believe that rapid substantial 7price changes are not to our industry's benefit. Our customer and supplier base would be impacted due to uncertainty as to future prices. A reluctance to purchase inventory in the face of extreme price decreases or to sell quickly during a period of rapid price increases would likely reduce our volume of business. Marginal industry participants or speculators may attempt to participate to an unhealthy extent during a period of rapid price escalation with a substantial risk of contract default if prices suddenly reverse. Risks of default in contract performance by customers or suppliers as well as an increased risk of bad debts and customer credit exposure could increase during periods of rapid and substantial price changes.Excess capacity and over-production by foreign producers in our industry as well as the startup of new steel-making capacity in the U.S. could result in lower domestic prices, which would adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability. Global steel-making capacity exceeds demand for steel products in some regions around the world. Rather than reducing employment by rationalizing capacity with consumption, steel manufacturers in these countries (often with local government assistance or subsidies in various forms) have traditionally periodically exported steel at prices significantly below their home market prices, which prices may not reflect their costs of production or capital. For example, steel production in China, the world's largest producer and consumer of steel, has continued to exceed Chinese demand. This rising excess capacity in China has resulted in a further increase in imports of artificially low-priced steel and steel products to the U.S. and world steel markets. A continuation of this trend or a significant decrease in China's rate of economic expansion could result in increasing steel imports from China. Excessive imports of steel into the U.S. have exerted, and may continue to exert, downward pressure on U.S. steel prices, which negatively affects our ability to increase our sales, margins, and profitability. The excess capacity may create downward pressure on our steel prices and lead to reduced sales volumes as imports absorb market share that would otherwise be filled by domestic supply, all of which would adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability and could subject us to possible renegotiation of contracts or increases in bad debt. Excess capacity has also led to greater protectionism as is evident in raw material and finished product border tariffs put in place by China, Brazil and other countries. We believe the downward pressure on, and periodically depressed levels of, U.S. steel prices in some recent years have been further exacerbated by imports of steel involving dumping and subsidy abuses by foreign steel producers. While some tariffs and quotas are periodically put into effect for certain steel products imported from a number of countries that have been found to have been unfairly pricing steel imports to the U.S., there is no assurance that tariffs and quotas will always be levied, even if otherwise justified, and even when imposed many of these are short-lived or ineffective. On March 8, 2018, President Trump signed a proclamation imposing a 25% tariff on all imported steel products for an indefinite period of time under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (""Section 232""). The tariff is imposed on all steel imports with the exception of steel imports originating from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and South Korea, and the administration is considering exemption requests from other countries. When this or other tariffs or duties expire or if others are further relaxed or repealed, or if relatively higher U.S. steel prices make it attractive for foreign steelmakers to export their steel products to the U.S., despite the presence of duties or tariffs, the resurgence of substantial imports of foreign steel could create downward pressure on U.S. steel prices.The adverse effects of excess capacity and over-production by foreign producers could be exacerbated by the startup of new steel-making capacity in the U.S. Any of these adverse effects could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Compliance with and changes in environmental compliance requirements and remediation requirements could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs; violations of environmental requirements could result in costs that have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Existing environmental laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, and future laws and regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is a significant factor in our business. We are subject to local, state, federal and international environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other matters, waste disposal, air emissions, waste and storm water effluent and disposal and employee health. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may seek injunctive relief impacting continuing operations for non-compliance with environmental requirements. New facilities that we may build, especially steel mills, are required to obtain several environmental permits before significant construction or commencement of operations. Delays in obtaining permits or unanticipated conditions in such permits could delay the project or increase construction costs or operating expenses. Our manufacturing and recycling operations produce significant amounts of by-products, some of which are handled as industrial waste or hazardous waste. For example, our EAF 8mills generate electric arc furnace dust (""EAF dust""), which the EPA and other regulatory authorities classify as hazardous waste. EAF dust and other industrial waste and hazardous waste require special handling, recycling or disposal.In addition, the primary feed materials for the shredders operated by our recycling facilities are automobile hulks and obsolete household appliances. Approximately 20% of the weight of an automobile hull consists of unrecyclable material known as shredder fluff. After the segregation of ferrous and saleable nonferrous metals, shredder fluff remains. We, along with others in the recycling industry, interpret federal regulations to require shredder fluff to meet certain criteria and pass a toxic leaching test to avoid classification as a hazardous waste. We also endeavor to remove hazardous contaminants from the feed material prior to shredding. As a result, we believe the shredder fluff we generate is not normally considered or properly classified as hazardous waste. If the laws, regulations or testing methods change with regard to EAF dust or shredder fluff or other by-products, we may incur additional significant costs.Changes to National Ambient Air Quality Standards (""NAAQS"") or other requirements on our air emissions could make it more difficult to obtain new permits or to modify existing permits and could require changes to our operations or emissions control equipment. Such difficulties and changes could result in operational delays and capital and ongoing compliance expenditures.Legal requirements are changing frequently and are subject to interpretation. New laws, regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities, together with uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels, testing and sampling procedures, new pollution control technology and cost/benefit analysis based on market conditions are all factors that may increase our future expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. Accordingly, we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of future compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. We cannot predict whether such costs would be able to be passed on to customers through product price increases. Competitors in various regions or countries where environmental regulation is less restrictive, subject to different interpretation or generally not enforced, may enjoy a competitive advantage.We may also be required to conduct additional cleanup (and pay for associated natural resource damages) at sites where we have already participated in remediation efforts or take remediation action with regard to sites formerly used in connection with our operations. We may be required to pay for a portion or all of the costs of cleanup or remediation at sites we never owned or on which we never operated if we are found to have arranged for treatment or disposal of hazardous substances on the sites. In cases of joint and several liability, we may be obligated to pay a disproportionate share of cleanup costs if other responsible parties are financially insolvent.We are involved, and may in the future become involved, in various environmental matters that may result in fines, penalties or judgments being assessed against us or liability imposed upon us which we cannot presently estimate or reasonably foresee and which may have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Under CERCLA or similar state statutes, we may have obligations to conduct investigation and remediation activities associated with alleged releases of hazardous substances or to reimburse the EPA (or state agencies as applicable) for such activities and to pay for natural resource damages associated with alleged releases. We have been named a PRP at several federal and state Superfund sites because the EPA or an equivalent state agency contends that we and other potentially responsible scrap metal suppliers are liable for the cleanup of those sites as a result of having sold scrap metal to unrelated manufacturers for recycling as a raw material in the manufacture of new products. We are involved in litigation or administrative proceedings with regard to several of these sites in which we are contesting, or at the appropriate time may contest, our liability. In addition, we have received information requests with regard to other sites which may be under consideration by the EPA as potential CERCLA sites.We are presently participating in PRP organizations at several sites, which are paying for certain remediation expenses. Although we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure to loss in connection with various environmental matters or the effect on our consolidated financial position, we make accruals as warranted. In addition, although we do not believe that a reasonably possible range of loss in excess of amounts accrued for pending lawsuits, claims or proceedings would be material to our financial statements, additional developments may occur, and due to inherent uncertainties, including evolving remediation technology, changing regulations, possible third-party contributions, the inherent uncertainties of the estimation process, the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors, the amounts we ultimately are required to pay could vary significantly from the amounts we accrue, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Increased regulation associated with climate change and greenhouse gas emissions could impose significant additional costs on both our steelmaking and metals recycling operations. 9The U.S. government and various governmental agencies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impact of climate change. International treaties or agreements may also result in increasing regulation of greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions, including the introduction of carbon emissions trading mechanisms. Any such regulation regarding climate change and GHG emissions could impose significant costs on our steelmaking and metals recycling operations and on the operations of our customers and suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs in order to comply with current or future laws or regulations and limitations imposed on our operations by virtue of climate change and GHG emissions laws and regulations. The potential costs of ""allowances,"" ""offsets"" or ""credits"" that may be part of potential cap-and-trade programs or similar future regulatory measures are still uncertain. Any adopted future climate change and GHG regulations could negatively impact our ability (and that of our customers and suppliers) to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. From a medium and long-term perspective, as a result of these regulatory initiatives, we may see an increase in costs relating to our assets that emit significant amounts of GHGs. These regulatory initiatives will be either voluntary or mandatory and may impact our operations directly or through our suppliers or customers. Until the timing, scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known, we cannot predict the effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, but such effect could be materially adverse to our business, results of operations and financial condition.Physical impacts of climate change could have a material adverse effect on our costs and operations.There has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with rising sea levels as well as extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and snow or ice storms. Extreme weather conditions may increase our costs or cause damage to our facilities, and any damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. Many of our facilities are located near coastal areas or waterways where rising sea levels or flooding could disrupt our operations or adversely impact our facilities. Furthermore, periods of extended inclement weather or associated flooding may inhibit construction activity utilizing our products, delay or hinder shipments of our products to customers or reduce scrap metal inflows to our recycling facilities. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on our costs or results of operations.RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMPANYOur business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and stock price may be adversely affected by global public health epidemics, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic.The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and stock price. Other pandemics, epidemics, widespread illness or other health issues that interfere with the ability of our employees, suppliers, customers, financing sources or others to conduct business, or negatively affects consumer confidence or the global economy, could also adversely affect us. In March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic, and the President of the United States declared COVID-19 a national emergency. COVID-19 has resulted in various government actions globally, including governmental actions in both the U.S. and Poland designed to slow the spread of the virus. Shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders were implemented in many of the jurisdictions where we operate. However, because we operate in a critical infrastructure industry, our operations were allowed to remain open in the U.S. Our facilities in Poland have also remained open. In spite of our continued operations, COVID-19 may have negative impacts on our operations, supply chain, transportation networks and customers, which may compress our margins, including as a result of preventative and precautionary measures that we, other businesses and governments are taking. COVID-19 is a widespread public health crisis that is adversely affecting financial markets and the economies of many countries. Any resulting economic downturn could adversely affect demand for our products and contribute to volatile supply and demand conditions affecting prices and volumes in the markets for our products and raw materials. The progression of COVID-19 could also negatively impact our business or results of operations through the temporary closure of our operating facilities or those of our customers or suppliers.In addition, the ability of our suppliers and customers to work may be significantly impacted by individuals contracting or being exposed to COVID-19 or as a result of the control measures noted above, which may negatively impact our production throughout the supply chain and constrict sales channels. Our customers may be directly impacted by business interruptions or weak market conditions and may not be willing or able to fulfill their contractual obligations. Furthermore, the progression of and global response to COVID-19 increases the risk of delays in construction activities and equipment deliveries related to our capital projects, including potential delays in obtaining permits from government agencies. The extent of such delays and other effects of COVID-19 on our capital projects, certain of which are outside of our control, is unknown, but they could impact or delay the timing of anticipated benefits on capital projects. COVID-19 has also caused volatility in the financial and capital 10markets and may adversely affect our ability to access, and the costs associated with accessing, the debt or equity capital markets, which could adversely affect our liquidity.The extent to which COVID-19 may adversely impact our business depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, including new information concerning the severity of the pandemic and the effectiveness of actions globally to contain or mitigate its effects. While we expect COVID-19 to negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position, the current level of uncertainty over the economic and operational impacts of COVID-19 and the actions to contain the outbreak or treat its impact means the related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.Potential limitations on our ability to access credit, or the ability of our customers and suppliers to access credit, may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If our access to credit is limited or impaired, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. Our senior unsecured debt is rated by Standard & Poor's Corporation, Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Group, Inc. In determining our credit ratings, the rating agencies consider a number of both quantitative and qualitative factors. These factors include earnings (loss), fixed charges such as interest, cash flows, total debt outstanding, off-balance sheet obligations and other commitments, total capitalization and various ratios calculated from these factors. The rating agencies also consider predictability of cash flows, business strategy and diversity, industry conditions and contingencies. Any downgrades in our credit ratings may make raising capital more difficult, increase the cost and affect the terms of future borrowings, affect the terms under which we purchase goods and services and limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities. We could also be adversely affected if our banks refused to honor their contractual commitments or cease lending.We are also exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our customers and suppliers. In certain markets, we have experienced a consolidation among those entities to whom we sell. This consolidation has resulted in an increased credit risk spread among fewer customers, often without a corresponding strengthening of their financial status. If the availability of credit to fund or support the continuation and expansion of our customers' business operations is curtailed or if the cost of that credit is increased, the resulting inability of our customers or of their customers to either access credit or absorb the increased cost of that credit could adversely affect our business by reducing our sales or by increasing our exposure to losses from uncollectible customer accounts. The consequences of such adverse effects could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers, the reduction, delay or cancellation of customer orders, delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase and bankruptcy of customers, suppliers or other creditors. Any of these events may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.The potential impact of our customers' non-compliance with existing commercial contracts and commitments, due to insolvency or for any other reason, may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.From time to time in the past, some of our customers have sought to renegotiate or cancel their existing purchase commitments with us. In addition, some of our customers have breached previously agreed upon contracts to buy our products by refusing delivery of the products. Where appropriate, we have and will in the future pursue litigation to recover our damages resulting from customer contract defaults and bankruptcy filings. We use credit assessments in the U.S. and credit insurance in Poland to mitigate the risk of customer insolvency. However, a large number of our customers defaulting on existing contractual obligations to purchase our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.The agreements governing our notes and our other debt contain financial covenants and impose restrictions on our business. The indenture governing our 4.875% senior notes due 2023, our 5.750% senior notes due 2026, and our 5.375% senior notes due 2027 contains restrictions on our ability to create liens, sell assets, enter into sale and leaseback transactions and consolidate or merge. In addition to these restrictions, our credit facility contains covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things, enter into transactions with affiliates and guarantee the debt of some of our subsidiaries. Our credit facility also requires that we meet certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios, including maximum debt to capitalization and interest coverage ratios.Other agreements that we may enter into in the future may contain covenants imposing significant restrictions on our business that are similar to, or in addition to, the covenants under our existing agreements. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.11Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. The breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the indenture governing our notes or under our other debt agreements. An event of default under our debt agreements would permit our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If we were unable to repay debt to our secured lenders or if we incur secured debt in the future, these lenders could proceed against the collateral securing that debt. In addition, acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on our notes. We may not be able to successfully identify, consummate or integrate acquisitions, and acquisitions may adversely affect our financial leverage. Part of our business strategy includes pursuing synergistic acquisitions. We have expanded, and plan to continue to expand, our business by making strategic acquisitions and regularly seeking suitable acquisition targets to enhance our growth. We may fund such acquisitions using cash on hand, drawing under our credit facility or accessing the capital markets. To the extent we finance such acquisitions with additional debt, the incurrence of such debt may result in a significant increase in our interest expense and financial leverage, which could be further exacerbated by volatility in the debt capital markets. Further, an increase in our leverage could lead to deterioration in our credit ratings.The pursuit of acquisitions may pose certain risks to us. We may not be able to identify acquisition candidates that fit our criteria for growth and profitability. Even if we are able to identify such candidates, we may not be able to acquire them on terms or financing satisfactory to us. We will incur expenses and dedicate attention and resources associated with the review of acquisition opportunities, whether or not we consummate such acquisitions. Additionally, even if we are able to acquire suitable targets on agreeable terms, we may not be able to successfully integrate their operations with ours. Achieving the anticipated benefits of any acquisition will depend in significant part upon whether we integrate such acquired businesses in an efficient and effective manner. We may not be able to achieve the anticipated operating and cost synergies or long-term strategic benefits of our acquisitions within the anticipated timing or at all. For example, elimination of duplicative costs may not be fully achieved or may take longer than anticipated. The benefits from any acquisition will be offset by the costs incurred in integrating the businesses and operations. We may also assume liabilities in connection with acquisitions to which we would not otherwise be exposed. An inability to realize any or all of the anticipated synergies or other benefits of an acquisition as well as any delays that may be encountered in the integration process, which may delay the timing of such synergies or other benefits, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.New and clarifying guidance with regard to interpretation of certain provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.On December 22, 2017, the President signed into law Public Law No. 115-97, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""TCJA""), following its passage by the United States Congress, which significantly changed the U.S. corporate income tax system. The TCJA requires complex computations to be performed, which require significant judgments, estimates and calculations to be made in interpreting its provisions. The U.S. Department of Treasury continues to release new and clarifying guidance on certain provisions of the TCJA, which the Company evaluates during the period of enactment. This new guidance could require us to make adjustments to amounts we have previously recorded, which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.Goodwill impairment charges in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We review the recoverability of goodwill annually, as of the first day of our fourth quarter, and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable. The impairment tests require us to make an estimate of the fair value of our reporting units. An impairment could be recorded as a result of changes in assumptions, estimates or circumstances, some of which are beyond our control. Factors which could result in an impairment include, but are not limited to: (i) reduced demand for our products; (ii) our cost of capital; (iii) higher material prices; (iv) slower growth rates in our industry; and (v) changes in the market based discount rates. Since a number of factors may influence determinations of fair value of goodwill, we are unable to predict whether impairments of goodwill will occur in the future, and there can be no assurance that continued conditions will not result in future impairments of goodwill. The future occurrence of a potential indicator of impairment could include matters such as (i) a decrease in expected net 12earnings; (ii) adverse equity market conditions; (iii) a decline in current market multiples; (iv) a decline in our common stock price; (v) a significant adverse change in legal factors or the general business climate; (vi) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; (vii) a significant downturn in non-residential construction markets in the U.S.; and (viii) levels of imported steel into the U.S. Any such impairment would result in us recognizing a non-cash charge in our consolidated statements of earnings, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Impairment of long-lived assets in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We have a significant amount of property, plant and equipment, finite-lived intangible assets and right of use assets that may be subject to impairment testing. Long-lived assets are subject to an impairment assessment when certain triggering events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may be impaired. If the net carrying value of the asset or group of assets exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows of the operations related to the asset, the excess of the net book value over estimated fair value is charged to impairment loss in the consolidated statements of earnings. The primary factors that affect estimates of future cash flows for these long-lived asset groups are (i) management's raw material price outlook; (ii) market demand; (iii) working capital changes; (iv) capital expenditures; and (v) selling, general and administrative expenses. There can be no assurance that continued market conditions, demand for our products, or facility utilization levels or other factors will not result in future impairment charges.Increases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. An increase in the value of the U.S. dollar may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, and in particular, the increased strength of the U.S. dollar as compared to China's renminbi or the euro could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. A strong U.S. dollar makes imported metal products less expensive, resulting in more imports of steel products into the U.S. by our foreign competitors, while a weak U.S. dollar may have the opposite impact on imports. With the exception of exports of nonferrous scrap metal by the recycling facilities in our North America segment, we have not recently been a significant exporter of metal products. Economic difficulties in some large steel-producing regions of the world, resulting in lower local demand for steel products, have historically encouraged greater steel exports to the U.S. at depressed prices which can be exacerbated by a strong U.S. dollar. As a result, our products that are made in the U.S. may become relatively more expensive as compared to imported steel, which has had, and in the future could have, a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.There can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares of our common stock at all or in any particular amounts.During the first quarter of 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the Company to repurchase up to $100.0 million of shares of our common stock. The stock markets in general have experienced substantial price and trading fluctuations, which have resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities that often are unrelated or disproportionate to changes in operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Price volatility over a given period may also cause the average price at which we repurchase our own common stock to exceed the stock's price at a given point in time. In addition, significant changes in the trading price of our common stock and our ability to access capital on terms favorable to us could impact our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock. The timing and amount of any repurchases will be determined by the Company's management based on its evaluation of market conditions, capital allocation alternatives and other factors beyond our control. Our share repurchase program may be modified, suspended, extended or terminated by the Company at any time and without notice.Operating internationally carries risks and uncertainties which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have significant facilities in Poland. Our Polish operations generated approximately 13% of our 2020 net sales. Our stability, growth and profitability are subject to a number of risks inherent in doing business internationally in addition to the currency exchange risk and operating risks discussed above, including:•political, military, terrorist or major pandemic events;•local labor and social issues;•legal and regulatory requirements or limitations imposed by foreign governments (particularly those with significant steel consumption or steel-related production including China, Brazil, Russia and India), including quotas, tariffs or other 13protectionist trade barriers, adverse tax law changes, nationalization or currency restrictions; •disruptions or delays in shipments caused by customs compliance or government agencies; and •potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations.These factors may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Scrap and other supplies for our business are subject to significant price fluctuations and limited availability, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. At any given time, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of critical raw materials at a price and other terms acceptable to us. We depend on ferrous scrap, the primary raw material used by our steel mills, and other supplies such as graphite electrodes and ferroalloys for our steel mill operations. The price of scrap and other supplies has historically been subject to significant fluctuation, and we may not be able to adjust our product prices to recover the costs of rapid increases in material prices, especially over the short-term and in our fixed price contracts. The profitability of our operations would be adversely affected if we are unable to pass increased raw material and supply costs on to our customers. Changing processes could potentially impact the volume of scrap metal available to us and the volume and realized margins of processed metal we sell. The purchase prices for automobile bodies and various other grades of obsolete and industrial scrap, as well as the selling prices for processed and recycled scrap metals we utilize in our own manufacturing process or resell to others, are highly volatile. A prolonged period of low scrap prices or a fall in scrap prices could reduce our ability to obtain, process and sell recycled material, which could have a material adverse effect on our metals recycling operations business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices may be limited by competitive or other factors during periods of low scrap prices, when the supply of scrap may decline considerably, as scrap generators hold onto their scrap in the hope of getting higher prices later. Conversely, increased foreign demand for scrap due to economic expansion in countries such as China, India, Brazil and Turkey can result in an outflow of available domestic scrap as well as higher scrap prices that cannot always be passed on to domestic scrap consumers, further reducing the available domestic scrap flows and scrap margins, all of which could adversely affect our sales and profitability. The availability and process of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations, allocations by suppliers, interruptions in production, accidents or natural disasters, changes in exchange rates, global price fluctuations, and the availability and cost of transportation. If we were unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials, we may be unable to timely manufacture significant quantities of our products. We rely on the availability of large amounts of electricity and natural gas. Disruptions in delivery or substantial increases in energy costs, including crude oil prices, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our EAF mills melt steel scrap in electric arc furnaces and use natural gas to heat steel billets for rolling into finished steel products. As large consumers of electricity and gas, often the largest in the geographic area where our mills are located, we must have dependable delivery of electricity and natural gas in order to operate. Accordingly, we are at risk in the event of an energy disruption. Prolonged black-outs or brown-outs or disruptions caused by natural disasters such as hurricanes would substantially disrupt our production. While we have not suffered prolonged production delays due to our inability to access electricity or natural gas, several of our competitors have experienced such occurrences. Prolonged substantial increases in energy costs would have an adverse effect on the costs of operating our mills and would negatively impact our gross margins unless we were able to fully pass through the additional expense to our customers. Our finished steel products are typically delivered by truck. Rapid increases in the price of fuel attributable to increases in crude oil prices would increase our costs and adversely affect many of our customers' financial results, which in turn could result in reduced margins and declining demand for our products. 14The loss of, or inability to hire, key employees may adversely affect our ability to successfully manage our operations and meet our strategic objectives. Our future success depends, in large part, on the continued service of our officers and other key employees and our ability to continue to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel. These employees are integral to our success based on their expertise and knowledge of our business and products. We compete for such personnel with other companies, including public and private company competitors who may periodically offer more favorable terms of employment. The loss or interruption of the services of a number of our key employees could reduce our ability to effectively manage our operations due to the fact that we may not be able to find appropriate replacement personnel in a timely manner should the need arise.We may have difficulty competing with companies that have a lower cost structure or access to greater financial resources. We compete with regional, national and foreign manufacturers and traders. Consolidation among participants in the steel manufacturing and recycling industries has resulted in fewer competitors, and several of our competitors are significantly larger than us and have greater financial resources and more diverse businesses than us. Some of our foreign competitors may be able to pursue business opportunities without regard to certain of the laws and regulations with which we must comply, such as environmental regulations. These companies may have a lower cost structure and more operating flexibility, and consequently they may be able to offer better prices and more services than we can. There is no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with these companies. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Information technology interruptions and breaches in data security could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.We rely on computers, information and communications technology and related systems and networks in order to operate our business, including to store sensitive data such as intellectual property, our own proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners and personally identifiable information of our employees. Increased global information technology security requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and a rise in sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems, networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Our systems and networks are also subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, employee error and other similar events. Any of these or other events could result in system interruption, the disclosure, modification or destruction of proprietary and other key information, legal claims or proceedings, production delays or disruptions to operations including processing transactions and reporting financial results and could adversely impact our reputation and our operating results. We have taken steps to address these concerns and have implemented internal control and security measures to protect our systems and networks from security breaches; however, there can be no assurance that a system or network failure, or security breach, will not impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our mills require continual capital investments that we may not be able to sustain. We must make regular substantial capital investments in our steel mills to maintain the mills, lower production costs and remain competitive. We cannot be certain that we will have sufficient internally generated cash or acceptable external financing to make necessary substantial capital expenditures in the future. The availability of external financing depends on many factors outside of our control, including capital market conditions and the overall performance of the economy. If funding is insufficient, we may be unable to develop or enhance our mills, take advantage of business opportunities and respond to competitive pressures.Unexpected equipment failures may lead to production curtailments or shutdowns, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Interruptions in our production capabilities would adversely affect our production costs, steel available for sale and earnings for the affected period. Our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of steel-making equipment, such as our furnaces, continuous casters and rolling equipment, as well as electrical equipment, such as transformers. This equipment may, on occasion, be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, material plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such equipment failures. In addition to equipment failures, our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, explosions or violent weather conditions.15Competition from other materials may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In many applications, steel competes with other materials, such as aluminum and plastics (particularly in the automobile industry), cement, composites, glass and wood. Increased use of or additional substitutes for steel products could adversely affect future market prices and demand for steel products.Hedging transactions may expose us to losses or limit our potential gains. Our product lines and global operations expose us to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. As part of our risk management program, we sometimes use financial instruments, including metals commodity futures, natural gas, electricity and other energy forward contracts, freight forward contracts, foreign currency exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts. While intended to reduce the effects of fluctuations in these prices and rates, these transactions may limit our potential gains or expose us to losses. If our counterparties to such transactions or the sponsors of the exchanges through which these transactions are offered, such as the London Metal Exchange, fail to honor their obligations due to financial distress, we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipated gains from these transactions.We enter into the foreign currency exchange forward contracts as economic hedges of trade commitments or anticipated commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency to mitigate the effects of changes in currency rates. These foreign exchange commitments are dependent on timely performance by our counterparties. Their failure to perform could result in our having to close these hedges without the anticipated underlying transaction and could result in losses if foreign currency exchange rates have changed.We are subject to litigation and legal compliance risks which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are involved in various litigation matters, including regulatory proceedings, administrative proceedings, governmental investigations, environmental matters and construction contract disputes. The nature of our operations also exposes us to possible litigation claims in the future. Because of the uncertain nature of litigation and coverage decisions, we cannot predict the outcome of these matters. These matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Litigation is very costly, and the costs associated with prosecuting and defending litigation matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure to loss in connection with litigation matters, we make accruals as warranted. However, the amounts that we accrue could vary significantly from the amounts we actually pay, due to inherent uncertainties, including the inherent uncertainties of the estimation process, the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors. See Part I, Item 3, ""Legal Proceedings"" of this Annual Report, for a description of our current significant legal proceedings.As noted above, existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, and future laws and regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See the risk factor ""Compliance with and changes in environmental compliance requirements and remediation requirements could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs; violations of environmental requirements could result in costs that have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition"" above for a description of such risks relating to environmental laws and regulations. In addition to such environmental laws and regulations, complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, including without limitation the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws in other countries, which generally prohibit companies and those acting on their behalf from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, regulations related to import-export controls, the Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions program and antiboycott provisions, may increase our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and expose us and our employees to elevated risk. While we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs, the nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist. A negative outcome in an unusual or significant legal proceeding or compliance investigation could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our operations present significant risk of injury or death. The industrial activities conducted at our facilities present significant risk of serious injury or death to our employees, customers or other visitors to our operations, notwithstanding our safety precautions, including our material compliance with federal, state and local employee health and safety regulations, and we may be unable to avoid material liabilities for injuries or 16deaths. We maintain workers' compensation insurance to address the risk of incurring material liabilities for injuries or deaths, but there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage will be adequate or will continue to be available on the terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could result in material liabilities to us for any injuries or deaths.Health care legislation could result in substantially increased costs and adversely affect our workforce. The health care mandates enacted in connection with the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act may cause us to evaluate the scope of health benefits offered to our workforce and the method in which they are delivered, and increase our and our employees' costs. If we are not able to offer a competitive level of benefits, our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel may be adversely affected. Higher health care costs may result in (i) an inability to reinvest sufficient capital in our operations, (ii) an inability to sustain dividends, (iii) lowered debt ratings and (iv) an increase in the cost of capital, all of which may have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition"
2,CMC,COMMERCIAL METALS,2019-10-23,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSThere are inherent risks and uncertainties associated with our business that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Set forth below are descriptions of those risks and uncertainties that we currently believe to be material, but the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRYOur industry and the industries we serve are vulnerable to global economic conditions. Metals industries and commodity products have historically been vulnerable to significant declines in consumption, global overcapacity and depressed product pricing during prolonged periods of economic downturn. Our business supports cyclical industries such as commercial, government and residential construction, energy, metals service center, petrochemical and original equipment manufacturing. We may experience significant fluctuations in demand for our products from these industries based on global or regional economic conditions, energy prices, consumer demand and decisions by governments to fund infrastructure projects such as highways, schools, energy plants and airports. Although the residential housing market is not a significant direct factor in our business, related commercial and infrastructure construction activities, such as shopping centers, schools and roads, could be adversely impacted by a prolonged slump in new housing construction. Our business, results of operations and financial condition are adversely affected when the industries we serve suffer a prolonged downturn or anemic growth. Because we do not have unlimited backlogs, our business, results of operations and financial condition are promptly affected by short-term economic fluctuations.Although we believe that the long-term prospects for the steel industry remain bright, we are unable to predict the duration of current economic conditions that are contributing to current demand for our products compared to pre-recession levels. Future economic downturns or a prolonged period of slow growth or economic stagnation could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.We are vulnerable to the economic conditions in the regions in which our operations are concentrated.Economic downturns in the U.S. and Central Europe, or decisions by governments that have an impact on the level and pace of overall economic activity in one of these regions, could adversely affect demand for our products and, consequently, our sales and profitability. As a result, our financial results are substantially dependent upon the overall economic conditions in these areas.Rapid and significant changes in the price of metals could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Prices for most metals in which we deal have experienced increased volatility over the last several years, and such increased price volatility impacts us in several ways. Some of our operations, such as our fabrication operations, may benefit from rapidly decreasing steel prices as their material cost for previously contracted fixed price work declines. Others, such as our Americas Mills and International Mill segments, would likely experience reduced margins and may be forced to liquidate high cost inventory at reduced margins or losses until prices stabilize. Sudden increases could have the opposite effect in each case. Overall, we believe that rapid 8substantial price changes are not to our industry's benefit. Our customer and supplier base would be impacted due to uncertainty as to future prices. A reluctance to purchase inventory in the face of extreme price decreases or to sell quickly during a period of rapid price increases would likely reduce our volume of business. Marginal industry participants or speculators may attempt to participate to an unhealthy extent during a period of rapid price escalation with a substantial risk of contract default if prices suddenly reverse. Risks of default in contract performance by customers or suppliers as well as an increased risk of bad debts and customer credit exposure could increase during periods of rapid and substantial price changes.Excess capacity and over-production by foreign producers in our industry as well as the startup of new steel-making capacity in the U.S. could result in lower domestic prices, which would adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability. Global steel-making capacity exceeds demand for steel products in some regions around the world. Rather than reducing employment by rationalizing capacity with consumption, steel manufacturers in these countries (often with local government assistance or subsidies in various forms) have traditionally periodically exported steel at prices significantly below their home market prices, which prices may not reflect their costs of production or capital. For example, steel production in China, the world's largest producer and consumer of steel, has continued to exceed Chinese demand. This rising excess capacity in China has resulted in a further increase in imports of artificially low-priced steel and steel products to the U.S. and world steel markets. A continuation of this trend or a significant decrease in China's rate of economic expansion could result in increasing steel imports from China. Excessive imports of steel into the U.S. have exerted, and may continue to exert, downward pressure on U.S. steel prices, which negatively affects our ability to increase our sales, margins, and profitability. The excess capacity may create downward pressure on our steel prices and lead to reduced sales volumes as imports absorb market share that would otherwise be filled by domestic supply, all of which would adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability and could subject us to possible renegotiation of contracts or increases in bad debt. Excess capacity has also led to greater protectionism as is evident in raw material and finished product border tariffs put in place by China, Brazil and other countries. We believe the downward pressure on, and periodically depressed levels of, U.S. steel prices in some recent years have been further exacerbated by imports of steel involving dumping and subsidy abuses by foreign steel producers. While some tariffs and quotas are periodically put into effect for certain steel products imported from a number of countries that have been found to have been unfairly pricing steel imports to the U.S., there is no assurance that tariffs and quotas will always be levied, even if otherwise justified, and even when imposed many of these are short-lived or ineffective. On March 8, 2018, President Trump signed a proclamation imposing a 25% tariff on all imported steel products for an indefinite period of time under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (""Section 232""). The tariff is imposed on all steel imports with the exception of steel imports originating from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and South Korea, and the administration is considering exemption requests from other countries. When this or other tariffs or duties expire or if others are further relaxed or repealed, or if relatively higher U.S. steel prices make it attractive for foreign steelmakers to export their steel products to the U.S., despite the presence of duties or tariffs, the resurgence of substantial imports of foreign steel could create downward pressure on U.S. steel prices.The adverse effects of excess capacity and over-production by foreign producers could be exacerbated by the startup of new steel-making capacity in the U.S., which is scheduled to enter production in the next couple years. Any of these adverse effects could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Compliance with and changes in environmental compliance requirements and remediation requirements could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs; violations of environmental requirements could result in costs that have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Existing environmental laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, and future laws and regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is a significant factor in our business. We are subject to local, state, federal and international environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other matters, waste disposal, air emissions, waste and storm water effluent and disposal and employee health. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may seek injunctive relief impacting continuing operations for non-compliance with environmental requirements. New facilities that we may build, especially steel mills, are required to obtain several environmental permits before significant construction or commencement of operations. Delays in obtaining permits or unanticipated conditions in such permits could delay the project or increase construction costs or operating expenses. Our manufacturing and recycling operations produce significant amounts of by-products, some of which are handled as industrial waste or hazardous waste. For example, our EAF mills generate electric arc furnace dust (""EAF dust""), which the EPA and other regulatory authorities classify as hazardous waste. EAF dust and other industrial waste and hazardous waste require special handling, recycling or disposal.9In addition, the primary feed materials for the shredders operated by our scrap metal recycling facilities are automobile hulks and obsolete household appliances. Approximately 20% of the weight of an automobile hull consists of unrecyclable material known as shredder fluff. After the segregation of ferrous and saleable nonferrous metals, shredder fluff remains. We, along with others in the recycling industry, interpret federal regulations to require shredder fluff to meet certain criteria and pass a toxic leaching test to avoid classification as a hazardous waste. We also endeavor to remove hazardous contaminants from the feed material prior to shredding. As a result, we believe the shredder fluff we generate is not normally considered or properly classified as hazardous waste. If the laws, regulations or testing methods change with regard to EAF dust or shredder fluff or other by-products, we may incur additional significant costs.Changes to National Ambient Air Quality Standards (""NAAQS"") or other requirements on our air emissions could make it more difficult to obtain new permits or to modify existing permits and could require changes to our operations or emissions control equipment. Such difficulties and changes could result in operational delays and capital and ongoing compliance expenditures.Legal requirements are changing frequently and are subject to interpretation. New laws, regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities, together with uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels, testing and sampling procedures, new pollution control technology and cost/benefit analysis based on market conditions are all factors that may increase our future expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. Accordingly, we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of future compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. We cannot predict whether such costs would be able to be passed on to customers through product price increases. Competitors in various regions or countries where environmental regulation is less restrictive, subject to different interpretation or generally not enforced, may enjoy a competitive advantage.We may also be required to conduct additional cleanup (and pay for associated natural resource damages) at sites where we have already participated in remediation efforts or take remediation action with regard to sites formerly used in connection with our operations. We may be required to pay for a portion or all of the costs of cleanup or remediation at sites we never owned or on which we never operated if we are found to have arranged for treatment or disposal of hazardous substances on the sites. In cases of joint and several liability, we may be obligated to pay a disproportionate share of cleanup costs if other responsible parties are financially insolvent.We are involved, and may in the future become involved, in various environmental matters that may result in fines, penalties or judgments being assessed against us or liability imposed upon us which we cannot presently estimate or reasonably foresee and which may have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Under CERCLA or similar state statutes, we may have obligations to conduct investigation and remediation activities associated with alleged releases of hazardous substances or to reimburse the EPA (or state agencies as applicable) for such activities and to pay for natural resource damages associated with alleged releases. We have been named a PRP at several federal and state Superfund sites because the EPA or an equivalent state agency contends that we and other potentially responsible scrap metal suppliers are liable for the cleanup of those sites as a result of having sold scrap metal to unrelated manufacturers for recycling as a raw material in the manufacture of new products. We are involved in litigation or administrative proceedings with regard to several of these sites in which we are contesting, or at the appropriate time may contest, our liability. In addition, we have received information requests with regard to other sites which may be under consideration by the EPA as potential CERCLA sites.We are presently participating in PRP organizations at several sites, which are paying for certain remediation expenses. Although we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure to loss in connection with various environmental matters or the effect on our consolidated financial position, we make accruals as warranted. In addition, although we do not believe that a reasonably possible range of loss in excess of amounts accrued for pending lawsuits, claims or proceedings would be material to our financial statements, additional developments may occur, and due to inherent uncertainties, including evolving remediation technology, changing regulations, possible third-party contributions, the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process, the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors, the amounts we ultimately are required to pay could vary significantly from the amounts we accrue, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Increased regulation associated with climate change and greenhouse gas emissions could impose significant additional costs on both our steelmaking and metals recycling operations. The U.S. government and various governmental agencies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impact of climate change. International treaties or agreements may also result in increasing regulation of greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions, including the introduction of carbon emissions trading mechanisms. Any such regulation regarding climate change and GHG emissions could impose significant costs on our steelmaking and metals recycling operations and on the operations of our customers and suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other 10costs in order to comply with current or future laws or regulations concerning and limitations imposed on our operations by virtue of climate change and GHG emissions laws and regulations. The potential costs of ""allowances,"" ""offsets"" or ""credits"" that may be part of potential cap-and-trade programs or similar future regulatory measures are still uncertain. Any adopted future climate change and GHG regulations could negatively impact our ability (and that of our customers and suppliers) to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. From a medium and long-term perspective, as a result of these regulatory initiatives, we may see an increase in costs relating to our assets that emit significant amounts of GHGs. These regulatory initiatives will be either voluntary or mandatory and may impact our operations directly or through our suppliers or customers. Until the timing, scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known, we cannot predict the effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, but such effect could be materially adverse to our business, results of operations and financial condition.Physical impacts of climate change could have a material adverse effect on our costs and operations.There has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with rising sea levels as well as extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and snow or ice storms. Extreme weather conditions may increase our costs or cause damage to our facilities, and any damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. Many of our facilities are located near coastal areas or waterways where rising sea levels or flooding could disrupt our operations or adversely impact our facilities. Furthermore, periods of extended inclement weather or associated flooding may inhibit construction activity utilizing our products, delay or hinder shipments of our products to customers or reduce scrap metal inflows to our recycling facilities. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on our costs or results of operations.RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMPANYPotential limitations on our ability to access credit, or the ability of our customers and suppliers to access credit, may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If our access to credit is limited or impaired, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. Our senior unsecured debt is rated by Standard & Poor's Corporation, Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Group, Inc. In determining our credit ratings, the rating agencies consider a number of both quantitative and qualitative factors. These factors include earnings (loss), fixed charges such as interest, cash flows, total debt outstanding, off-balance sheet obligations and other commitments, total capitalization and various ratios calculated from these factors. The rating agencies also consider predictability of cash flows, business strategy and diversity, industry conditions and contingencies. Any downgrades in our credit ratings may make raising capital more difficult, increase the cost and affect the terms of future borrowings, affect the terms under which we purchase goods and services and limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities. We could also be adversely affected if our banks refused to honor their contractual commitments or cease lending.We are also exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our customers and suppliers. In certain markets, we have experienced a consolidation among those entities to whom we sell. This consolidation has resulted in an increased credit risk spread among fewer customers, often without a corresponding strengthening of their financial status. If the availability of credit to fund or support the continuation and expansion of our customers' business operations is curtailed or if the cost of that credit is increased, the resulting inability of our customers or of their customers to either access credit or absorb the increased cost of that credit could adversely affect our business by reducing our sales or by increasing our exposure to losses from uncollectible customer accounts. The consequences of such adverse effects could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers, the reduction, delay or cancellation of customer orders, delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase, and bankruptcy of customers, suppliers or other creditors. Any of these events may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.The potential impact of our customers' non-compliance with existing commercial contracts and commitments, due to insolvency or for any other reason, may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.From time to time in the past, some of our customers have sought to renegotiate or cancel their existing purchase commitments with us. In addition, some of our customers have breached previously agreed upon contracts to buy our products by refusing delivery of the products. Where appropriate, we have and will in the future pursue litigation to recover our damages resulting from customer contract defaults and bankruptcy filings. We use credit assessments in the U.S. and credit insurance in Poland to mitigate the risk of customer insolvency. However, a large number of our customers defaulting on existing contractual obligations to purchase our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.11The agreements governing our notes and our other debt contain financial covenants and impose restrictions on our business. The indenture governing our 4.875% senior notes due 2023, our 5.750% senior notes due 2026, and our 5.375% senior notes due 2027 contains restrictions on our ability to create liens, sell assets, enter into sale and leaseback transactions and consolidate or merge. In addition to these restrictions, our credit facility contains covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things, enter into transactions with affiliates and guarantee the debt of some of our subsidiaries. Our credit facility also requires that we meet certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios, including maximum debt to capitalization and interest coverage ratios.Other agreements that we may enter into in the future may contain covenants imposing significant restrictions on our business that are similar to, or in addition to, the covenants under our existing agreements. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. The breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the indenture governing our notes or under our other debt agreements. An event of default under our debt agreements would permit our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If we were unable to repay debt to our secured lenders or if we incur secured debt in the future, these lenders could proceed against the collateral securing that debt. In addition, acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on our notes. We may not be able to successfully identify, consummate or integrate acquisitions, and acquisitions may adversely affect our financial leverage. Part of our business strategy includes pursuing synergistic acquisitions. We have expanded, and plan to continue to expand, our business by making strategic acquisitions and regularly seeking suitable acquisition targets to enhance our growth. We may fund such acquisitions using cash on hand, drawing under our credit facility or accessing the capital markets. To the extent we finance such acquisitions with additional debt, the incurrence of such debt may result in a significant increase in our interest expense and financial leverage, which could be further exacerbated by volatility in the debt capital markets. Further, an increase in our leverage could lead to deterioration in our credit ratings.The pursuit of acquisitions may pose certain risks to us. We may not be able to identify acquisition candidates that fit our criteria for growth and profitability. Even if we are able to identify such candidates, we may not be able to acquire them on terms or financing satisfactory to us. We will incur expenses and dedicate attention and resources associated with the review of acquisition opportunities, whether or not we consummate such acquisitions. Additionally, even if we are able to acquire suitable targets on agreeable terms, we may not be able to successfully integrate their operations with ours. Achieving the anticipated benefits of any acquisition will depend in significant part upon whether we integrate such acquired businesses in an efficient and effective manner. We may not be able to achieve the anticipated operating and cost synergies or long-term strategic benefits of our acquisitions within the anticipated timing or at all. For example, elimination of duplicative costs may not be fully achieved or may take longer than anticipated. The benefits from any acquisition will be offset by the costs incurred in integrating the businesses and operations. We may also assume liabilities in connection with acquisitions to which we would not otherwise be exposed. An inability to realize any or all of the anticipated synergies or other benefits of an acquisition as well as any delays that may be encountered in the integration process, which may delay the timing of such synergies or other benefits, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of the Acquired Businesses or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. We may also encounter significant difficulties in integrating the Acquired Businesses.Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of the Acquired Businesses (the ""Acquisition"") will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate the Acquired Businesses, which is a complex, costly and time consuming process. Because the Acquired Businesses were carved-out from a larger enterprise, integrating the Acquired Businesses will be inherently more difficult than if they were a standalone business. As a result, we must devote significant management attention and resources to integrate our business practices and operations with those of the Acquired Businesses. The integration process may disrupt our business and, if implemented ineffectively, could restrict the realization of all of the expected benefits of the Acquisition. The failure to meet the challenges involved in the integration process and to realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquired Businesses could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our operations and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition, the integration of the Acquired Businesses may result in material, unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses and loss of customers and other business relationships. Additional integration challenges include:12•diversion of management's attention to integration matters;•difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from the Acquisition;•difficulties in conforming standards, controls, procedures and accounting and other policies, business cultures and compensation structures;•difficulties in the assimilation of employees;•difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company;•challenges in retaining key personnel;•the impact of known and unknown liabilities that we may inherit from the Acquired Businesses; and •coordinating a geographically dispersed organization.Many of these factors are outside of our control, and any one of them could result in increased costs, lower than expected revenues and diversion of management's time and energy, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in us becoming subject to litigation.In addition, even if the Acquired Businesses are integrated successfully, we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition, including the synergies, cost savings and sales or growth opportunities. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration process. Any of these factors could cause reductions in our earnings per share, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the Acquisition and negatively impact the price of our common stock.New and clarifying guidance with regard to interpretation of certain provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.On December 22, 2017, the President signed into law Public Law No. 115-97, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""TCJA""), following its passage by the United States Congress, which significantly changed the U.S. corporate income tax system. The TCJA requires complex computations to be performed, which require significant judgments, estimates and calculations to be made in interpreting its provisions. The U.S. Department of Treasury continues to release new and clarifying guidance on certain provisions of the TCJA, which the Company evaluates during the period of enactment. This new guidance could require us to make adjustments to amounts we have previously recorded, which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.Goodwill impairment charges in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We review the recoverability of goodwill annually, as of the first day of our fourth quarter, and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable. The impairment tests require us to make an estimate of the fair value of our reporting units. An impairment could be recorded as a result of changes in assumptions, estimates or circumstances, some of which are beyond our control. Factors which could result in an impairment include, but are not limited to: (i) reduced demand for our products; (ii) our cost of capital; (iii) higher material prices; (iv) slower growth rates in our industry; and (v) changes in the market based discount rates. Since a number of factors may influence determinations of fair value of goodwill, we are unable to predict whether impairments of goodwill will occur in the future, and there can be no assurance that continued conditions will not result in future impairments of goodwill. The future occurrence of a potential indicator of impairment could include matters such as (i) a decrease in expected net earnings; (ii) adverse equity market conditions; (iii) a decline in current market multiples; (iv) a decline in our common stock price; (v) a significant adverse change in legal factors or the general business climate; (vi) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; (vii) a significant downturn in non-residential construction markets in the U.S.; and (viii) levels of imported steel into the U.S. Any such impairment would result in us recognizing a non-cash charge in our consolidated statements of earnings, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 13Impairment of long-lived assets in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We have a significant amount of property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets that may be subject to impairment testing. Long-lived assets are subject to an impairment assessment when certain triggering events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may be impaired. If the net carrying value of the asset or group of assets exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows of the operations related to the asset, the excess of the net book value over estimated fair value is charged to impairment loss in the consolidated statements of earnings. The primary factors that affect estimates of future cash flows for these long-lived asset groups are (i) management's raw material price outlook; (ii) market demand; (iii) working capital changes; (iv) capital expenditures; and (v) selling, general and administrative expenses. There can be no assurance that continued market conditions, demand for our products, or facility utilization levels or other factors will not result in future impairment charges.Increases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. An increase in the value of the U.S. dollar may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, and in particular, the increased strength of the U.S. dollar as compared to China's renminbi or the euro could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. A strong U.S. dollar makes imported metal products less expensive, resulting in more imports of steel products into the U.S. by our foreign competitors, while a weak U.S. dollar may have the opposite impact on imports. With the exception of exports of nonferrous scrap metal by our Americas Recycling segment, we have not recently been a significant exporter of metal products from our U.S. operations. Economic difficulties in some large steel-producing regions of the world, resulting in lower local demand for steel products, have historically encouraged greater steel exports to the U.S. at depressed prices which can be exacerbated by a strong U.S. dollar. As a result, our products that are made in the U.S. may become relatively more expensive as compared to imported steel, which has had, and in the future could have, a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.There can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares of our common stock at all or in any particular amounts.During the first quarter of 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the Company to repurchase up to $100.0 million of shares of our common stock. The stock markets in general have experienced substantial price and trading fluctuations, which have resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities that often are unrelated or disproportionate to changes in operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Price volatility over a given period may also cause the average price at which we repurchase our own common stock to exceed the stock's price at a given point in time. In addition, significant changes in the trading price of our common stock and our ability to access capital on terms favorable to us could impact our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock. The timing and amount of any repurchases will be determined by the Company's management based on its evaluation of market conditions, capital allocation alternatives and other factors beyond our control. Our share repurchase program may be modified, suspended, extended or terminated by the Company at any time and without notice.Operating internationally carries risks and uncertainties which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have significant facilities in Poland. Our Polish operations generated approximately 14% of our 2019 net sales. Our stability, growth and profitability are subject to a number of risks inherent in doing business internationally in addition to the currency exchange risk and operating risks discussed above, including:•political, military, terrorist or major pandemic events;•local labor and social issues;•legal and regulatory requirements or limitations imposed by foreign governments (particularly those with significant steel consumption or steel-related production including China, Brazil, Russia and India), including quotas, tariffs or other protectionist trade barriers, adverse tax law changes, nationalization or currency restrictions; •disruptions or delays in shipments caused by customs compliance or government agencies; and •potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations.14These factors may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Scrap and other supplies for our business are subject to significant price fluctuations and limited availability, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. At any given time, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of critical raw materials at a price and other terms acceptable to us. We depend on ferrous scrap, the primary feedstock for our steel mills, and other supplies such as graphite electrodes and ferroalloys for our steel mill operations. The price of scrap and other supplies has historically been subject to significant fluctuation, and we may not be able to adjust our product prices to recover the costs of rapid increases in material prices, especially over the short-term and in our domestic fabrication segment's fixed price contracts. The profitability of our steel mill operations and domestic fabrication segments would be adversely affected if we are unable to pass on to our customers increased raw material and supply costs. Changing processes could potentially impact the volume of scrap metal available to us and the volume and realized margins of processed metal we sell. The purchase prices for automobile bodies and various other grades of obsolete and industrial scrap, as well as the selling prices for processed and recycled scrap metals we utilize in our own manufacturing process or resell to others, are highly volatile. A prolonged period of low scrap prices or a fall in scrap prices could reduce our ability to obtain, process and sell recycled material, which could have a material adverse effect on our metals recycling operations business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices may be limited by competitive or other factors during periods of low scrap prices, when the supply of scrap may decline considerably, as scrap generators hold onto their scrap in the hope of getting higher prices later. Conversely, increased foreign demand for scrap due to economic expansion in countries such as China, India, Brazil and Turkey can result in an outflow of available domestic scrap as well as higher scrap prices that cannot always be passed on to domestic scrap consumers, further reducing the available domestic scrap flows and scrap margins, all of which could adversely affect our sales and profitability. The availability and process of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations, allocations by suppliers, interruptions in production, accidents or natural disasters, changes in exchange rates, worldwide price fluctuations, and the availability and cost of transportation. If we were unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials, we may be unable to timely manufacture significant quantities of our products. We rely on the availability of large amounts of electricity and natural gas for our mill operations. Disruptions in delivery or substantial increases in energy costs, including crude oil prices, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our EAF mills melt steel scrap in electric arc furnaces and use natural gas to heat steel billets for rolling into finished products. As large consumers of electricity and gas, often the largest in the geographic area where our mills are located, we must have dependable delivery of electricity and natural gas in order to operate. Accordingly, we are at risk in the event of an energy disruption. Prolonged black-outs or brown-outs or disruptions caused by natural disasters such as hurricanes would substantially disrupt our production. While we have not suffered prolonged production delays due to our inability to access electricity or natural gas, several of our competitors have experienced such occurrences. Prolonged substantial increases in energy costs would have an adverse effect on the costs of operating our mills and would negatively impact our gross margins unless we were able to fully pass through the additional expense to our customers. Our finished steel products are typically delivered by truck. Rapid increases in the price of fuel attributable to increases in crude oil prices would increase our costs and adversely affect many of our customers' financial results, which in turn could result in reduced margins and declining demand for our products. The loss of or inability to hire key employees may adversely affect our ability to successfully manage our operations and meet our strategic objectives. Our future success depends, in large part, on the continued service of our officers and other key employees and our ability to continue to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel. These employees are integral to our success based on their expertise and knowledge of our business and products. We compete for such personnel with other companies, including public and private company competitors who may periodically offer more favorable terms of employment. The loss or interruption of the services of a number of our key employees could reduce our ability to effectively manage our operations due to the fact that we may not be able to find appropriate replacement personnel in a timely manner should the need arise.15We may have difficulty competing with companies that have a lower cost structure or access to greater financial resources. We compete with regional, national and foreign manufacturers and traders. Consolidation among participants in the steel manufacturing and recycling industries has resulted in fewer competitors, and several of our competitors are significantly larger than us and have greater financial resources and more diverse businesses than us. Some of our foreign competitors may be able to pursue business opportunities without regard to certain of the laws and regulations with which we must comply, such as environmental regulations. These companies may have a lower cost structure and more operating flexibility, and consequently they may be able to offer better prices and more services than we can. There is no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with these companies. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Information technology interruptions and breaches in data security could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.We rely on computers, information and communications technology and related systems and networks in order to operate our business, including to store sensitive data such as intellectual property, our own proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners and personally identifiable information of our employees. Increased global information technology security requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and a rise in sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems, networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Our systems and networks are also subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, employee error and other similar events. Any of these or other events could result in system interruption, the disclosure, modification or destruction of proprietary and other key information, legal claims or proceedings, production delays or disruptions to operations including processing transactions and reporting financial results and could adversely impact our reputation and our operating results. We have taken steps to address these concerns and have implemented internal control and security measures to protect our systems and networks from security breaches; however, there can be no assurance that a system or network failure, or security breach, will not impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our mills require continual capital investments that we may not be able to sustain. We must make regular substantial capital investments in our steel mills to maintain the mills, lower production costs and remain competitive. We cannot be certain that we will have sufficient internally generated cash or acceptable external financing to make necessary substantial capital expenditures in the future. The availability of external financing depends on many factors outside of our control, including capital market conditions and the overall performance of the economy. If funding is insufficient, we may be unable to develop or enhance our mills, take advantage of business opportunities and respond to competitive pressures.Unexpected equipment failures may lead to production curtailments or shutdowns, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Interruptions in our production capabilities would adversely affect our production costs, steel available for sale and earnings for the affected period. Our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of steel-making equipment, such as our furnaces, continuous casters and rolling equipment, as well as electrical equipment, such as transformers. This equipment may, on occasion, be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, material plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such equipment failures. In addition to equipment failures, our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, explosions or violent weather conditions.Competition from other materials may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In many applications, steel competes with other materials, such as aluminum and plastics (particularly in the automobile industry), cement, composites, glass and wood. Increased use of or additional substitutes for steel products could adversely affect future market prices and demand for steel products.16Hedging transactions may expose us to losses or limit our potential gains. Our product lines and worldwide operations expose us to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. As part of our risk management program, we sometimes use financial instruments, including metals commodity futures, natural gas forward contracts, freight forward contracts, foreign currency exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts. While intended to reduce the effects of fluctuations in these prices and rates, these transactions may limit our potential gains or expose us to losses. If our counterparties to such transactions or the sponsors of the exchanges through which these transactions are offered, such as the London Metal Exchange, fail to honor their obligations due to financial distress, we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipated gains from these transactions.We enter into the foreign currency exchange forward contracts as economic hedges of trade commitments or anticipated commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency to mitigate the effects of changes in currency rates. These foreign exchange commitments are dependent on timely performance by our counterparties. Their failure to perform could result in our having to close these hedges without the anticipated underlying transaction and could result in losses if foreign currency exchange rates have changed.We are subject to litigation and legal compliance risks which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are involved in various litigation matters, including regulatory proceedings, administrative proceedings, governmental investigations, environmental matters and construction contract disputes. The nature of our operations also exposes us to possible litigation claims in the future. Because of the uncertain nature of litigation and coverage decisions, we cannot predict the outcome of these matters. These matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Litigation is very costly, and the costs associated with prosecuting and defending litigation matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure to loss in connection with litigation matters, we make accruals as warranted. However, the amounts that we accrue could vary significantly from the amounts we actually pay, due to inherent uncertainties and the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process, the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors. See Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report, for a description of our current significant legal proceedings.As noted above, existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, and future laws and regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See the risk factor ""Compliance with and changes in environmental compliance requirements and remediation requirements could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs; violations of environmental requirements could result in costs that have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition"" above for a description of such risks relating to environmental laws and regulations. In addition to such environmental laws and regulations, complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, including without limitation the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws in other countries, which generally prohibit companies and those acting on their behalf from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, regulations related to import-export controls, the Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions program and antiboycott provisions, may increase our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and expose us and our employees to elevated risk. While we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs, the nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist. A negative outcome in an unusual or significant legal proceeding or compliance investigation could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our operations present significant risk of injury or death. The industrial activities conducted at our facilities present significant risk of serious injury or death to our employees, customers or other visitors to our operations, notwithstanding our safety precautions, including our material compliance with federal, state and local employee health and safety regulations, and we may be unable to avoid material liabilities for injuries or deaths. We maintain workers' compensation insurance to address the risk of incurring material liabilities for injuries or deaths, but there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage will be adequate or will continue to be available on the terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could result in material liabilities to us for any injuries or deaths.Health care legislation could result in substantially increased costs and adversely affect our workforce. The health care mandates enacted in connection with the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act may cause us to evaluate the scope of health benefits offered to our workforce and the method in which they are delivered, and increase our and our employees' costs. If we are not able to offer a competitive level of benefits, our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel may 17be adversely affected. Higher health care costs may result in (i) an inability to reinvest sufficient capital in our operations, (ii) an inability to sustain dividends, (iii) lowered debt ratings and (iv) an increase in the cost of capital, all of which may have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition"
3,CMC,COMMERCIAL METALS,2018-10-25,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSThere are inherent risks and uncertainties associated with our business that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Set forth below are descriptions of those risks and uncertainties that we currently believe to be material, but the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRYOur industry and the industries we serve are vulnerable to global economic conditions. Metals industries and commodity products have historically been vulnerable to significant declines in consumption, global overcapacity and depressed product pricing during prolonged periods of economic downturn. Our business supports cyclical industries such as commercial, government and residential construction, energy, metals service center, petrochemical and original equipment manufacturing. We may experience significant fluctuations in demand for our products from these industries based on global or regional economic conditions, energy prices, consumer demand and decisions by governments to fund infrastructure projects such as highways, schools, energy plants and airports. Although the residential housing market is not a significant direct factor in our business, related commercial and infrastructure construction activities, such as shopping centers, schools and roads, could be adversely impacted by a prolonged slump in new housing construction. Our business, results of operations and financial condition are adversely affected when the industries we serve suffer a prolonged downturn or anemic growth. Because we do not have unlimited backlogs, our business, results of operations and financial condition are promptly affected by short-term economic fluctuations.Although we believe that the long-term prospects for the steel industry remain bright, we are unable to predict the duration of current economic conditions that are contributing to current demand for our products compared to pre-recession levels. Future economic downturns or a prolonged period of slow growth or economic stagnation could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.We are vulnerable to the economic conditions in the regions in which our operations are concentrated.Our geographic concentration in the southern and southwestern U.S. as well as Central Europe exposes us to the local market conditions in these regions. Economic downturns in these areas or decisions by governments that have an impact on the level and pace of overall economic activity in one of these regions could adversely affect demand for our products and, consequently, our sales and profitability. As a result, our financial results are substantially dependent upon the overall economic conditions in these areas.Rapid and significant changes in the price of metals could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Prices for most metals in which we deal have experienced increased volatility over the last several years, and such increased price volatility impacts us in several ways. Some of our operations, such as our fabrication operations, may benefit from rapidly decreasing steel prices as their material cost for previously contracted fixed price work declines. Others, such as our Americas Mills and International Mill segments, would likely experience reduced margins and may be forced to liquidate high cost inventory at reduced margins or losses until prices stabilize. Sudden increases could have the opposite effect in each case. Overall, we believe that rapid substantial price changes are not to our industry's benefit. Our customer and supplier base would be impacted due to uncertainty as to future prices. A reluctance to purchase inventory in the face of extreme price decreases or to sell quickly during a period of rapid price increases would likely reduce our volume of business. Marginal industry participants or speculators may attempt to participate to an unhealthy extent during a period of rapid price escalation with a substantial risk of contract default if prices suddenly reverse. Risks of default in contract performance by customers or suppliers as well as an increased risk of bad debts and customer credit exposure could increase during periods of rapid and substantial price changes.10Excess capacity and over-production by foreign producers in our industry could increase the level of steel imports into the U.S., resulting in lower domestic prices, which would adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability. Global steel-making capacity exceeds demand for steel products in some regions around the world. Rather than reducing employment by rationalizing capacity with consumption, steel manufacturers in these countries (often with local government assistance or subsidies in various forms) have traditionally periodically exported steel at prices significantly below their home market prices, which prices may not reflect their costs of production or capital. For example, steel production in China, the world's largest producer and consumer of steel, has continued to exceed Chinese demand. This rising excess capacity in China has resulted in a further increase in imports of artificially low-priced steel and steel products to the U.S. and world steel markets. A continuation of this trend or a significant decrease in China's rate of economic expansion could result in increasing steel imports from China. Excessive imports of steel into the U.S. have exerted, and may continue to exert, downward pressure on U.S. steel prices, which negatively affects our ability to increase our sales, margins, and profitability. The excess capacity may create downward pressure on our steel prices and lead to reduced sales volumes as imports absorb market share that would otherwise be filled by domestic supply, all of which would adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability and could subject us to possible renegotiation of contracts or increases in bad debt. We believe the downward pressure on, and periodically depressed levels of, U.S. steel prices in some recent years have been further exacerbated by imports of steel involving dumping and subsidy abuses by foreign steel producers. While some tariffs and quotas are periodically put into effect for certain steel products imported from a number of countries that have been found to have been unfairly pricing steel imports to the U.S., there is no assurance that tariffs and quotas will always be levied, even if otherwise justified, and even when imposed many of these are short-lived or ineffective. On March 8, 2018, President Trump signed a proclamation imposing a 25% tariff on all imported steel products for an indefinite period of time under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The tariff will be imposed on all steel imports with the exception of steel imported from Canada, Mexico and Australia, and the administration is considering exemption requests from other countries. We expect that this tariff, while in effect, will discourage some steel imports from non-exempt countries. However, we do not yet have sufficient information to evaluate in detail the possible impact of this tariff on our operations or results. When this or other tariffs or duties expire or if others are further relaxed or repealed, or if relatively higher U.S. steel prices make it attractive for foreign steelmakers to export their steel products to the U.S., despite the presence of duties or tariffs, the resurgence of substantial imports of foreign steel could create downward pressure on U.S. steel prices.Excess capacity has also led to greater protectionism as is evident in raw material and finished product border tariffs put in place by China, Brazil and other countries. Such protectionism could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Compliance with and changes in environmental compliance requirements and remediation requirements could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs; violations of environmental requirements could result in costs that have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Existing environmental laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, and future laws and regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is a significant factor in our business. We are subject to local, state, federal and international environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other matters, waste disposal, air emissions, waste and storm water effluent and disposal and employee health. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may seek injunctive relief impacting continuing operations for non-compliance with environmental requirements. New facilities that we may build, especially steel mills, like the micro mill we built in Durant, Oklahoma, are required to obtain several environmental permits before significant construction or commencement of operations. Delays in obtaining permits or unanticipated conditions in such permits could delay the project or increase construction costs or operating expenses. Our manufacturing and recycling operations produce significant amounts of by-products, some of which are handled as industrial waste or hazardous waste. For example, our EAF mills generate electric arc furnace dust (""EAF dust""), which the EPA and other regulatory authorities classify as hazardous waste. EAF dust and other industrial waste and hazardous waste require special handling, recycling or disposal.In addition, the primary feed materials for the shredders operated by our scrap metal recycling facilities are automobile hulks and obsolete household appliances. Approximately 20% of the weight of an automobile hull consists of unrecyclable material known as shredder fluff. After the segregation of ferrous and saleable nonferrous metals, shredder fluff remains. We, along with others in the recycling industry, interpret federal regulations to require shredder fluff to meet certain criteria and pass a toxic leaching test to avoid classification as a hazardous waste. We also endeavor to remove hazardous contaminants from the feed material prior 11to shredding. As a result, we believe the shredder fluff we generate is not normally considered or properly classified as hazardous waste. If the laws, regulations or testing methods change with regard to EAF dust or shredder fluff or other by-products, we may incur additional significant costs.Changes to National Ambient Air Quality Standards (""NAAQS"") or other requirements on our air emissions could make it more difficult to obtain new permits or to modify existing permits and could require changes to our operations or emissions control equipment. Such difficulties and changes could result in operational delays and capital and ongoing compliance expenditures.Legal requirements are changing frequently and are subject to interpretation. New laws, regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities, together with uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels, testing and sampling procedures, new pollution control technology and cost/benefit analysis based on market conditions are all factors that may increase our future expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. Accordingly, we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of future compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. We cannot predict whether such costs would be able to be passed on to customers through product price increases. Competitors in various regions or countries where environmental regulation is less restrictive, subject to different interpretation or generally not enforced, may enjoy a competitive advantage.We may also be required to conduct additional cleanup (and pay for associated natural resource damages) at sites where we have already participated in remediation efforts or take remediation action with regard to sites formerly used in connection with our operations. We may be required to pay for a portion or all of the costs of cleanup or remediation at sites we never owned or on which we never operated if we are found to have arranged for treatment or disposal of hazardous substances on the sites. In cases of joint and several liability, we may be obligated to pay a disproportionate share of cleanup costs if other responsible parties are financially insolvent.We are involved, and may in the future become involved, in various environmental matters that may result in fines, penalties or judgments being assessed against us or liability imposed upon us which we cannot presently estimate or reasonably foresee and which may have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Under CERCLA or similar state statutes, we may have obligations to conduct investigation and remediation activities associated with alleged releases of hazardous substances or to reimburse the EPA (or state agencies as applicable) for such activities and to pay for natural resource damages associated with alleged releases. We have been named a PRP at several federal and state Superfund sites because the EPA or an equivalent state agency contends that we and other potentially responsible scrap metal suppliers are liable for the cleanup of those sites as a result of having sold scrap metal to unrelated manufacturers for recycling as a raw material in the manufacture of new products. We are involved in litigation or administrative proceedings with regard to several of these sites in which we are contesting, or at the appropriate time may contest, our liability. In addition, we have received information requests with regard to other sites which may be under consideration by the EPA as potential CERCLA sites.We are presently participating in PRP organizations at several sites, which are paying for certain remediation expenses. Although we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure to loss in connection with various environmental matters or the effect on our consolidated financial position, we make accruals as warranted. In addition, although we do not believe that a reasonably possible range of loss in excess of amounts accrued for pending lawsuits, claims or proceedings would be material to our financial statements, additional developments may occur, and due to inherent uncertainties, including evolving remediation technology, changing regulations, possible third-party contributions, the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process, the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors, the amounts we ultimately are required to pay could vary significantly from the amounts we accrue, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Increased regulation associated with climate change and greenhouse gas emissions could impose significant additional costs on both our steelmaking and metals recycling operations. The U.S. government and various governmental agencies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impact of climate change. International treaties or agreements may also result in increasing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, including the introduction of carbon emissions trading mechanisms. Any such regulation regarding climate change and greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions could impose significant costs on our steelmaking and metals recycling operations and on the operations of our customers and suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs in order to comply with current or future laws or regulations concerning and limitations imposed on our operations by virtue of climate change and GHG emissions laws and regulations. The potential costs of ""allowances,"" ""offsets"" or ""credits"" that may be part of potential cap-and-trade programs or similar future regulatory measures are still uncertain. Any adopted future climate change and GHG regulations could negatively impact our ability (and that of our customers and suppliers) to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. From a medium and long-term perspective, as a result of these regulatory initiatives, we may see an increase in costs relating to our assets that emit significant amounts of GHGs. These 12regulatory initiatives will be either voluntary or mandatory and may impact our operations directly or through our suppliers or customers. Until the timing, scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known, we cannot predict the effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, but such effect could be materially adverse to our business, results of operations and financial condition.RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMPANYPotential limitations on our ability to access credit, or the ability of our customers and suppliers to access credit, may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If our access to credit is limited or impaired, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. Our senior unsecured debt is rated by Standard & Poor's Corporation, Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Group, Inc. In determining our credit ratings, the rating agencies consider a number of both quantitative and qualitative factors. These factors include earnings (loss), fixed charges such as interest, cash flows, total debt outstanding, off-balance sheet obligations and other commitments, total capitalization and various ratios calculated from these factors. The rating agencies also consider predictability of cash flows, business strategy and diversity, industry conditions and contingencies. Any downgrades in our credit ratings may make raising capital more difficult, increase the cost and affect the terms of future borrowings, affect the terms under which we purchase goods and services and limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities. We could also be adversely affected if our banks refused to honor their contractual commitments or cease lending.We are also exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our customers and suppliers. In certain markets, we have experienced a consolidation among those entities to whom we sell. This consolidation has resulted in an increased credit risk spread among fewer customers, often without a corresponding strengthening of their financial status. If the availability of credit to fund or support the continuation and expansion of our customers' business operations is curtailed or if the cost of that credit is increased, the resulting inability of our customers or of their customers to either access credit or absorb the increased cost of that credit could adversely affect our business by reducing our sales or by increasing our exposure to losses from uncollectible customer accounts. The consequences of such adverse effects could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers, the reduction, delay or cancellation of customer orders, delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase, and bankruptcy of customers, suppliers or other creditors. Any of these events may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.The potential impact of our customers' non-compliance with existing commercial contracts and commitments, due to insolvency or for any other reason, may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.From time to time in the past, some of our customers have sought to renegotiate or cancel their existing purchase commitments with us. In addition, some of our customers have breached previously agreed upon contracts to buy our products by refusing delivery of the products. Where appropriate, we have and will in the future pursue litigation to recover our damages resulting from customer contract defaults. We also use credit insurance in Poland to mitigate the risk of customer insolvency. However, it is possible that we may not be capable of recovering all of our insured losses if the insurers with whom our accounts receivable are insured experience significant losses threatening their viability. Additionally, credit insurance policies typically have relatively short policy periods and require pre-approval of customers with maximum insured limits established by the customer. If credit insurers incur large losses, the insurance may be more difficult and more costly to secure and may be on less favorable terms.  In addition, a significant amount of our accounts receivable are considered to be open account uninsured accounts receivable. A large number of our customers defaulting on existing contractual obligations to purchase our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.The agreements governing our notes and our other debt contain financial covenants and impose restrictions on our business. The indenture governing our 4.875% senior notes due 2023, our 5.750% senior notes due 2026, and our 5.375% senior notes due 2027 contains restrictions on our ability to create liens, sell assets, enter into sale and leaseback transactions and consolidate or merge. In addition to these restrictions, our credit facility contains covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things, enter into transactions with affiliates and guarantee the debt of some of our subsidiaries. Our credit facility also requires that we meet certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios, including maximum debt to capitalization and interest coverage ratios.Other agreements that we may enter into in the future may contain covenants imposing significant restrictions on our business that are similar to, or in addition to, the covenants under our existing agreements. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.13Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. The breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the indenture governing our notes or under our other debt agreements. An event of default under our debt agreements would permit our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If we were unable to repay debt to our secured lenders or if we incur secured debt in the future, these lenders could proceed against the collateral securing that debt. In addition, acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on our notes. We may not be able to successfully identify, consummate or integrate acquisitions, and acquisitions may adversely affect our financial leverage. Part of our business strategy includes pursuing synergistic acquisitions. We have expanded, and plan to continue to expand, our business by making strategic acquisitions and regularly seeking suitable acquisition targets to enhance our growth. We may fund such acquisitions using cash on hand, drawing under our credit facility or accessing the capital markets. To the extent we finance such acquisitions with additional debt, the incurrence of such debt may result in a significant increase in our interest expense and financial leverage, which could be further exacerbated by volatility in the debt capital markets. Further, an increase in our leverage could lead to deterioration in our credit ratings.The pursuit of acquisitions may pose certain risks to us. We may not be able to identify acquisition candidates that fit our criteria for growth and profitability. Even if we are able to identify such candidates, we may not be able to acquire them on terms or financing satisfactory to us. We will incur expenses and dedicate attention and resources associated with the review of acquisition opportunities, whether or not we consummate such acquisitions. Additionally, even if we are able to acquire suitable targets on agreeable terms, we may not be able to successfully integrate their operations with ours. Achieving the anticipated benefits of any acquisition will depend in significant part upon whether we integrate such acquired businesses in an efficient and effective manner. We may not be able to achieve the anticipated operating and cost synergies or long-term strategic benefits of our acquisitions within the anticipated timing or at all. For example, elimination of duplicative costs may not be fully achieved or may take longer than anticipated. The benefits from any acquisition will be offset by the costs incurred in integrating the businesses and operations. We may also assume liabilities in connection with acquisitions to which we would not otherwise be exposed. An inability to realize any or all of the anticipated synergies or other benefits of an acquisition as well as any delays that may be encountered in the integration process, which may delay the timing of such synergies or other benefits, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We may not be able to successfully or timely complete the pending acquisition of assets from Gerdau S.A.On December 29, 2017, we entered into a definitive purchase agreement to acquire certain U.S. rebar steel mill and fabrication assets from Gerdau S.A., a producer of long and specialty steel products in the Americas for a cash purchase price of $600.0 million, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. We expect the acquisition to close before the end of calendar year 2018, subject to customary closing conditions. However, there can be no assurance that the acquisition will be completed or on what terms it may be completed.  There are a number of risks and uncertainties relating to the acquisition. For example, the acquisition may not be completed, or may not be completed in the time frame, on the terms or in the manner currently anticipated, as a result of a number of factors, including, among other things, the failure to satisfy one or more of the conditions to closing. There can be no assurance that the conditions to closing of the acquisition of the acquired businesses will be satisfied or waived or that other events will not intervene to delay or result in the failure to close such acquisition. The consummation of the acquisition is subject to, among other things, review and approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”). In addition, both we and the sellers have the ability to terminate the purchase agreement under certain circumstances. Failure to complete the acquisition would prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits of such acquisition. We would also remain liable for significant transaction costs, including legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, and we could become liable to the sellers if the purchase agreement is terminated under certain circumstances for a termination fee equal to $40.0 million. In addition, the market price of our common stock may reflect various market assumptions as to whether the acquisition will be completed. Consequently, the completion of, the failure to complete, or any delay in the closing of the acquisition could result in a significant change in the market price of our common stock.14Recently enacted U.S. tax legislation may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.On December 22, 2017, the President signed into law Public Law No. 115-97, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""TCJA""), following its passage by the United States Congress, which significantly changed the U.S. corporate income tax system. The TCJA requires complex computations to be performed which require significant judgments, estimates and calculations to be made in interpreting its provisions.  The U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service, and other federal or state standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the TCJA will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation. As we continue our ongoing analysis of the TCJA and its related interpretations, including interpretation of any additional guidance, we may be required to make adjustments to amounts that we have previously recorded that may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.Goodwill impairment charges in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We review the recoverability of goodwill annually, as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter, and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable. The impairment tests require us to make an estimate of the fair value of our reporting units and other long-lived assets. An impairment could be recorded as a result of changes in assumptions, estimates or circumstances, some of which are beyond our control. Factors which could result in an impairment include, but are not limited to: (i) reduced demand for our products; (ii) our cost of capital; (iii) higher material prices; (iv) slower growth rates in our industry; and (v) changes in the market based discount rates. Since a number of factors may influence determinations of fair value of goodwill, we are unable to predict whether impairments of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangibles will occur in the future, and there can be no assurance that continued conditions will not result in future impairments of goodwill. The future occurrence of a potential indicator of impairment could include matters such as (i) a decrease in expected net earnings; (ii) adverse equity market conditions; (iii) a decline in current market multiples; (iv) a decline in our common stock price; (v) a significant adverse change in legal factors or the general business climate; (vi) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; (vii) a significant downturn in non-residential construction markets in the U.S.; and (viii) levels of imported steel into the U.S. Any such impairment would result in us recognizing a non-cash charge in our consolidated statements of earnings, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Impairment of long-lived assets in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We have a significant amount of property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets that may be subject to impairment testing. Long-lived assets are subject to an impairment assessment when certain triggering events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may be impaired. If the net carrying value of the asset or group of assets exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows of the operations related to the asset, the excess of the net book value over estimated fair value is charged to impairment loss in the consolidated statements of earnings. The primary factors that affect estimates of future cash flows for these long-lived asset groups are (i) management's scrap price outlook; (ii) scrap demand; (iii) working capital changes; (iv) capital expenditures; and (v) selling, general and administrative expenses. There can be no assurance that continued market conditions, demand for our products, or facility utilization levels or other factors will not result in future impairment charges.Increases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. An increase in the value of the U.S. dollar may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, and in particular, the increased strength of the U.S. dollar as compared to China's renminbi or the euro could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. A strong U.S. dollar makes imported metal products less expensive, resulting in more imports of steel products into the U.S. by our foreign competitors, while a weak U.S. dollar may have the opposite impact on imports. With the exception of exports of nonferrous scrap metal by our Americas Recycling segment, we have not recently been a significant exporter of metal products from our U.S. operations. Economic difficulties in some large steel-producing regions of the world, resulting in lower local demand for steel products, have historically encouraged greater steel exports to the U.S. at depressed prices which can be exacerbated by a strong U.S. dollar. As a result, our products that are made in the U.S. may become relatively more expensive as compared to imported steel, which has had, and in the future could have, a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.15There can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares of our common stock at all or in any particular amounts.During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the Company to repurchase up to $100.0 million of shares of our common stock. The stock markets in general have experienced substantial price and trading fluctuations, which have resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities that often are unrelated or disproportionate to changes in operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Price volatility over a given period may also cause the average price at which we repurchase our own common stock to exceed the stock's price at a given point in time. In addition, significant changes in the trading price of our common stock and our ability to access capital on terms favorable to us could impact our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock. The timing and amount of any repurchases will be determined by the Company's management based on its evaluation of market conditions, capital allocation alternatives and other factors beyond our control. Our share repurchase program may be modified, suspended, extended or terminated by the Company at any time and without notice.Operating internationally carries risks and uncertainties which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have significant facilities in Poland. Our Polish operations generated approximately 19% of our fiscal 2018 net sales. Our stability, growth and profitability are subject to a number of risks inherent in doing business internationally in addition to the currency exchange risk discussed above, including:•political, military, terrorist or major pandemic events;•local labor and social issues;•legal and regulatory requirements or limitations imposed by foreign governments (particularly those with significant steel consumption or steel-related production including China, Brazil, Russia and India), including quotas, tariffs or other protectionist trade barriers, adverse tax law changes, nationalization or currency restrictions; •disruptions or delays in shipments caused by customs compliance or government agencies; and •potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations.These factors may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Operating, commodity and market risks associated with our new micro mill in Durant, Oklahoma could prevent us from realizing anticipated benefits and could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our investment. Although we have successfully commissioned and operated similar technology in Mesa, Arizona, there are technological, operational and market risks associated with our newest micro mill, located in Durant, Oklahoma. We believe this micro mill should be capable of consistently producing high-quality reinforcing bar and other products, and in sufficient quantities and at a cost that will compare favorably with other similar steel manufacturing facilities; however, this micro mill has been in operation for less than a year, and there can be no assurance that these expectations will be achieved. If we encounter systems or process difficulties or quality control restrictions, our costs could materially increase, the expected cost benefits from the development of this micro mill could be diminished or lost, and we could lose all or a substantial portion of our investment. We could also encounter commodity market risk if, during a sustained period, the cost to manufacture is greater than projected.Scrap and other supplies for our business are subject to significant price fluctuations and limited availability, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. At any given time, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of critical raw materials at a price and other terms acceptable to us. We depend on ferrous scrap, the primary feedstock for our steel mills, and other supplies such as graphite electrodes and ferroalloys for our steel mill operations. The price of scrap and other supplies has historically been subject to significant fluctuation, and we may not be able to adjust our product prices to recover the costs of rapid increases in material prices, especially over the short-term and in our domestic fabrication segment's fixed price contracts. The profitability of our steel mill operations and domestic fabrication segments would be adversely affected if we are unable to pass on to our customers increased raw material and supply costs. Changing processes could potentially impact the volume of scrap metal available to us and the volume and realized margins of processed metal we sell. The purchase prices for automobile bodies and various other grades of obsolete and industrial scrap, as well as the selling prices 16for processed and recycled scrap metals we utilize in our own manufacturing process or resell to others, are highly volatile. A prolonged period of low scrap prices or a fall in scrap prices could reduce our ability to obtain, process and sell recycled material, which could have a material adverse effect on our metals recycling operations business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices may be limited by competitive or other factors during periods of low scrap prices, when the supply of scrap may decline considerably, as scrap generators hold onto their scrap in the hope of getting higher prices later. Conversely, increased foreign demand for scrap due to economic expansion in countries such as China, India, Brazil and Turkey can result in an outflow of available domestic scrap as well as higher scrap prices that cannot always be passed on to domestic scrap consumers, further reducing the available domestic scrap flows and scrap margins, all of which could adversely affect our sales and profitability.  Our Arkansas rerolling mill does not have melting capacity, so it is dependent on an adequate supply of competitively priced semi–finished billets either from our mini mills or competitors. Occasionally, our Arkansas rerolling mill utilizes used rail as a feedstock instead of billets, primarily from railroad abandonments or replacements. The inability to source billets internally or purchase competitively priced billets from other sources could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.The availability and process of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations, allocations by suppliers, interruptions in production, accidents or natural disasters, changes in exchange rates, worldwide price fluctuations, and the availability and cost of transportation. If we were unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials, we may be unable to timely manufacture significant quantities of our products. We rely on the availability of large amounts of electricity and natural gas for our mill operations. Disruptions in delivery or substantial increases in energy costs, including crude oil prices, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our EAF mills melt steel scrap in electric arc furnaces and use natural gas to heat steel billets for rolling into finished products. As large consumers of electricity and gas, often the largest in the geographic area where our mills are located, we must have dependable delivery of electricity and natural gas in order to operate. Accordingly, we are at risk in the event of an energy disruption. Prolonged black-outs or brown-outs or disruptions caused by natural disasters such as hurricanes would substantially disrupt our production. While we have not suffered prolonged production delays due to our inability to access electricity or natural gas, several of our competitors have experienced such occurrences. Prolonged substantial increases in energy costs would have an adverse effect on the costs of operating our mills and would negatively impact our gross margins unless we were able to fully pass through the additional expense to our customers. Our finished steel products are typically delivered by truck. Rapid increases in the price of fuel attributable to increases in crude oil prices would increase our costs and adversely affect many of our customers' financial results, which in turn could result in reduced margins and declining demand for our products. Rapid increases in fuel costs may also negatively impact our ability to charter ships for international deliveries at anticipated freight rates, thereby decreasing our margins on those transactions or causing our customers to look for alternative sources of supply.The loss of or inability to hire key employees may adversely affect our ability to successfully manage our operations and meet our strategic objectives. Our future success depends, in large part, on the continued service of our officers and other key employees and our ability to continue to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel. These employees are integral to our success based on their expertise and knowledge of our business and products. We compete for such personnel with other companies, including public and private company competitors who may periodically offer more favorable terms of employment. The loss or interruption of the services of a number of our key employees could reduce our ability to effectively manage our operations due to the fact that we may not be able to find appropriate replacement personnel in a timely manner should the need arise.We may have difficulty competing with companies that have a lower cost structure or access to greater financial resources. We compete with regional, national and foreign manufacturers and traders. Consolidation among participants in the steel manufacturing and recycling industries has resulted in fewer competitors, and several of our competitors are significantly larger than us and have greater financial resources and more diverse businesses than us. Some of our foreign competitors may be able to pursue business opportunities without regard to certain of the laws and regulations with which we must comply, such as environmental regulations. These companies may have a lower cost structure and more operating flexibility, and consequently they may be able to offer better prices and more services than we can. There is no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with these companies. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.17Information technology interruptions and breaches in data security could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.We rely on computers, information and communications technology and related systems and networks in order to operate our business, including to store sensitive data such as intellectual property, our own proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners and personally identifiable information of our employees. Increased global information technology security requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and a rise in sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems, networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Our systems and networks are also subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, employee error and other similar events. Any of these or other events could result in system interruption, the disclosure, modification or destruction of proprietary and other key information, legal claims or proceedings, production delays or disruptions to operations including processing transactions and reporting financial results and could adversely impact our reputation and our operating results. We have taken steps to address these concerns and have implemented internal control and security measures to protect our systems and networks from security breaches; however, there can be no assurance that a system or network failure, or security breach, will not impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our mills require continual capital investments that we may not be able to sustain. We must make regular substantial capital investments in our steel mills to maintain the mills, lower production costs and remain competitive. We cannot be certain that we will have sufficient internally generated cash or acceptable external financing to make necessary substantial capital expenditures in the future. The availability of external financing depends on many factors outside of our control, including capital market conditions and the overall performance of the economy. If funding is insufficient, we may be unable to develop or enhance our mills, take advantage of business opportunities and respond to competitive pressures.Unexpected equipment failures may lead to production curtailments or shutdowns, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Interruptions in our production capabilities would adversely affect our production costs, steel available for sale and earnings for the affected period. Our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of steel-making equipment, such as our furnaces, continuous casters and rolling equipment, as well as electrical equipment, such as transformers. This equipment may, on occasion, be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, material plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such equipment failures. In addition to equipment failures, our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, explosions or violent weather conditions.Competition from other materials may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In many applications, steel competes with other materials, such as aluminum and plastics (particularly in the automobile industry), cement, composites, glass and wood. Increased use of or additional substitutes for steel products could adversely affect future market prices and demand for steel products.Hedging transactions may expose us to losses or limit our potential gains. Our product lines and worldwide operations expose us to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. As part of our risk management program, we sometimes use financial instruments, including metals commodity futures, natural gas forward contracts, freight forward contracts, foreign currency exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts. While intended to reduce the effects of fluctuations in these prices and rates, these transactions may limit our potential gains or expose us to losses. If our counterparties to such transactions or the sponsors of the exchanges through which these transactions are offered, such as the London Metal Exchange, fail to honor their obligations due to financial distress, we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipated gains from these transactions.We enter into the foreign currency exchange forward contracts as economic hedges of trade commitments or anticipated commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency to mitigate the effects of changes in currency rates. These foreign exchange commitments are dependent on timely performance by our counterparties. Their failure to perform could result in our having to close these hedges without the anticipated underlying transaction and could result in losses if foreign currency exchange rates have changed.18We are subject to litigation and legal compliance risks which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are involved in various litigation matters, including regulatory proceedings, administrative proceedings, governmental investigations, environmental matters and construction contract disputes. The nature of our operations also exposes us to possible litigation claims in the future. Because of the uncertain nature of litigation and coverage decisions, we cannot predict the outcome of these matters. These matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Litigation is very costly, and the costs associated with prosecuting and defending litigation matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure to loss in connection with litigation matters, we make accruals as warranted. However, the amounts that we accrue could vary significantly from the amounts we actually pay, due to inherent uncertainties and the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process, the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors. See Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report, for a description of our current significant legal proceedings.As noted above, existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, and future laws and regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See the risk factor ""Compliance with and changes in environmental compliance requirements and remediation requirements could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs; violations of environmental requirements could result in costs that have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition"" above for a description of such risks relating to environmental laws and regulations. In addition to such environmental laws and regulations, complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, including without limitation the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws in other countries, which generally prohibit companies and those acting on their behalf from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, regulations related to import-export controls, the Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions program and antiboycott provisions, may increase our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and expose us and our employees to elevated risk. While we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs, the nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist. A negative outcome in an unusual or significant legal proceeding or compliance investigation could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Some of our operations present significant risk of injury or death. The industrial activities conducted at certain of our facilities present significant risk of serious injury or death to our employees, customers or other visitors to our operations, notwithstanding our safety precautions, including our material compliance with federal, state and local employee health and safety regulations, and we may be unable to avoid material liabilities for injuries or deaths. We maintain workers' compensation insurance to address the risk of incurring material liabilities for injuries or deaths, but there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage will be adequate or will continue to be available on the terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could result in material liabilities to us for any injuries or deaths.Health care legislation could result in substantially increased costs and adversely affect our workforce. The health care mandates enacted in connection with the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act may cause us to evaluate the scope of health benefits offered to our workforce and the method in which they are delivered, and increase our and our employees' costs. If we are not able to offer a competitive level of benefits, our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel may be adversely affected. Higher health care costs may result in (i) an inability to reinvest sufficient capital in our operations, (ii) an inability to sustain dividends, (iii) lowered debt ratings and (iv) an increase in the cost of capital, all of which may have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition"
6,CMC,COMMERCIAL METALS,2017-10-26,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSThere are inherent risks and uncertainties associated with our business that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Set forth below are descriptions of those risks and uncertainties that we currently believe to be material, but the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRYOur industry and the industries we serve are vulnerable to global economic conditions, including the slow recovery from the last recession and the risk of a recession relapse. Metals industries and commodity products have historically been vulnerable to significant declines in consumption, global overcapacity and product pricing during prolonged periods of economic downturn. Our business supports cyclical industries such as commercial, government and residential construction, energy, metals service center, petrochemical and original equipment manufacturing. We may experience significant fluctuations in demand for our products from these industries based on global or regional economic conditions, energy prices, consumer demand and decisions by governments to fund infrastructure projects such as highways, schools, energy plants and airports. Although the residential housing market is not a significant direct factor in our business, related commercial and infrastructure construction activities, such as shopping centers, schools and roads, could be adversely impacted by a prolonged slump in new housing construction. Our business, results of operations and financial condition are adversely affected when the industries we serve suffer a prolonged downturn or anemic growth. Because we do not have unlimited backlogs, our business, results of operations and financial condition are promptly affected by short-term economic fluctuations.11Nine years removed from the worldwide economic downturn that began in 2008, we have begun to see some improvement in general economic and manufacturing activity, but the economic outlook remains uncertain both in the U.S. and globally. In addition, uncertainties in Europe regarding the financial sector and sovereign debt and the potential impact on banks in other regions of the world have continued to weigh on global and domestic growth. These situations continue to contribute to weaker end-markets and depressed demand, which could stifle customer confidence and adversely affect demand for our products and further adversely affect our business. Although we believe that the long-term prospects for the steel industry remain bright, we are unable to predict the duration of current economic conditions that are contributing to reduced demand for our products compared to pre-recession levels. Future economic downturns or a prolonged period of slow growth or economic stagnation could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.We are vulnerable to the economic conditions in the regions in which our operations are concentrated.Our geographic concentration in the southern and southwestern U.S. as well as Central Europe, Southeast Asia and Australia exposes us to the local market conditions in these regions. Economic downturns in these areas or decisions by governments that have an impact on the level and pace of overall economic activity in one of these regions could adversely affect demand for our products and, consequently, our sales and profitability. As a result, our financial results are substantially dependent upon the overall economic conditions in these areas.Rapid and significant changes in the price of metals could continue to adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Prices for most metals in which we deal have experienced increased volatility over the last several years, and such increased price volatility impacts us in several ways. Some of our operations, such as our fabrication operations, may benefit from rapidly decreasing steel prices as their material cost for previously contracted fixed price work declines. Others, such as our Americas Mills and International Mill segments, would likely experience reduced margins and may be forced to liquidate high cost inventory at reduced margins or losses until prices stabilize. Sudden increases could have the opposite effect in each case. Overall, we believe that rapid substantial price changes are not to our industry's benefit. Our customer and supplier base would be impacted due to uncertainty as to future prices. A reluctance to purchase inventory in the face of extreme price decreases or to sell quickly during a period of rapid price increases would likely reduce our volume of business. Marginal industry participants or speculators may attempt to participate to an unhealthy extent during a period of rapid price escalation with a substantial risk of contract default if prices suddenly reverse. Risks of default in contract performance by customers or suppliers as well as an increased risk of bad debts and customer credit exposure could increase during periods of rapid and substantial price changes.Excess capacity and over-production by foreign producers in our industry could increase the level of steel imports into the U.S., resulting in lower domestic prices, which would adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability. Global steel-making capacity exceeds demand for steel products in some regions around the world. Rather than reducing employment by rationalizing capacity with consumption, steel manufacturers in these countries (often with local government assistance or subsidies in various forms) have traditionally periodically exported steel at prices significantly below their home market prices, which prices may not reflect their costs of production or capital. For example, steel production in China, the world's largest producer and consumer of steel, has continued to exceed Chinese demand. This rising excess capacity in China has resulted in a further increase in imports of artificially low-priced steel and steel products to the U.S. and world steel markets. A continuation of this trend or a significant decrease in China's rate of economic expansion could result in increasing steel imports from China. Excessive imports of steel into the U.S. have exerted, and may continue to exert, downward pressure on U.S. steel prices, which negatively affects our ability to increase our sales, margins, and profitability. The excess capacity may create downward pressure on our steel prices and lead to reduced sales volumes as imports absorb market share that would otherwise be filled by domestic supply, all of which would adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability and could subject us to possible renegotiation of contracts or increases in bad debt. We believe the downward pressure on, and periodically depressed levels of, U.S. steel prices in some recent years have been further exacerbated by imports of steel involving dumping and subsidy abuses by foreign steel producers. While some tariffs and quotas are periodically put into effect for certain steel products imported from a number of countries that have been found to have been unfairly pricing steel imports to the U.S., there is no assurance that tariffs and quotas will always be levied, even if otherwise justified, and even when imposed many of these are short-lived. When such tariffs or duties expire or if others are further relaxed or repealed, or if relatively higher U.S. steel prices make it attractive for foreign steelmakers to export their steel products to the U.S., despite the presence of duties or tariffs, the resurgence of substantial imports of foreign steel could create downward pressure on U.S. steel prices.Excess capacity has also led to greater protectionism as is evident in raw material and finished product border tariffs put in place 12by China, Brazil and other countries. Such protectionism could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Compliance with and changes in environmental compliance requirements and remediation requirements could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs; violations of environmental requirements could result in costs that have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Existing environmental laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, and future laws and regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is a significant factor in our business. We are subject to local, state, federal and international environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other matters, waste disposal, air emissions, waste and storm water effluent and disposal and employee health. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may seek injunctive relief impacting continuing operations for non-compliance with environmental requirements. New facilities that we may build, especially steel mills, like the micro mill we are building in Durant, Oklahoma, are required to obtain several environmental permits before significant construction or commencement of operations. Delays in obtaining permits or unanticipated conditions in such permits could delay the project or increase construction costs or operating expenses. Our manufacturing and recycling operations produce significant amounts of by-products, some of which are handled as industrial waste or hazardous waste. For example, our EAF mills generate electric arc furnace dust (""EAF dust""), which the EPA and other regulatory authorities classify as hazardous waste. EAF dust and other industrial waste and hazardous waste require special handling, recycling or disposal.In addition, the primary feed materials for the shredders operated by our scrap metal recycling facilities are automobile hulks and obsolete household appliances. Approximately 20% of the weight of an automobile hull consists of unrecyclable material known as shredder fluff. After the segregation of ferrous and saleable nonferrous metals, shredder fluff remains. We, along with others in the recycling industry, interpret federal regulations to require shredder fluff to meet certain criteria and pass a toxic leaching test to avoid classification as a hazardous waste. We also endeavor to remove hazardous contaminants from the feed material prior to shredding. As a result, we believe the shredder fluff we generate is not normally considered or properly classified as hazardous waste. If the laws, regulations or testing methods change with regard to EAF dust or shredder fluff or other by-products, we may incur additional significant costs.Changes to National Ambient Air Quality Standards (""NAAQS"") or other requirements on our air emissions could make it more difficult to obtain new permits or to modify existing permits and could require changes to our operations or emissions control equipment. Such difficulties and changes could result in operational delays and capital and ongoing compliance expenditures.Legal requirements are changing frequently and are subject to interpretation. New laws, regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities, together with uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels, testing and sampling procedures, new pollution control technology and cost/benefit analysis based on market conditions are all factors that may increase our future expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. Accordingly, we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of future compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. We cannot predict whether such costs would be able to be passed on to customers through product price increases. Competitors in various regions or countries where environmental regulation is less restrictive, subject to different interpretation or generally not enforced, may enjoy a competitive advantage.We may also be required to conduct additional cleanup (and pay for associated natural resource damages) at sites where we have already participated in remediation efforts or take remediation action with regard to sites formerly used in connection with our operations. We may be required to pay for a portion or all of the costs of cleanup or remediation at sites we never owned or on which we never operated if we are found to have arranged for treatment or disposal of hazardous substances on the sites. In cases of joint and several liability, we may be obligated to pay a disproportionate share of cleanup costs if other responsible parties are financially insolvent.We are involved and may in the future become involved in various environmental matters that may result in fines, penalties or judgments being assessed against us or liability imposed upon us which we cannot presently estimate or reasonably foresee and which may have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Under CERCLA or similar state statutes, we may have obligations to conduct investigation and remediation activities associated with alleged releases of hazardous substances or to reimburse the EPA (or state agencies as applicable) for such activities and to pay for natural resource damages associated with alleged releases. We have been named a PRP at several federal and state Superfund sites because the EPA or an equivalent state agency contends that we and other potentially responsible scrap metal suppliers are liable for the cleanup of those sites as a result of having sold scrap metal to unrelated manufacturers for recycling as a raw material 13in the manufacture of new products. We are involved in litigation or administrative proceedings with regard to several of these sites in which we are contesting, or at the appropriate time may contest, our liability. In addition, we have received information requests with regard to other sites which may be under consideration by the EPA as potential CERCLA sites.We are presently participating in PRP organizations at several sites, which are paying for certain remediation expenses. Although we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure to loss in connection with various environmental matters or the effect on our consolidated financial position, we make accruals as warranted. In addition, although we do not believe that a reasonably possible range of loss in excess of amounts accrued for pending lawsuits, claims or proceedings would be material to our financial statements, additional developments may occur, and due to inherent uncertainties, including evolving remediation technology, changing regulations, possible third-party contributions, the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process, the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors, the amounts we ultimately are required to pay could vary significantly from the amounts we accrue, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Increased regulation associated with climate change and greenhouse gas emissions could impose significant additional costs on both our steelmaking and metals recycling operations. The U.S. government and various governmental agencies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impact of climate change. International treaties or agreements may also result in increasing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, including the introduction of carbon emissions trading mechanisms. Any such regulation regarding climate change and greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions could impose significant costs on our steelmaking and metals recycling operations and on the operations of our customers and suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs in order to comply with current or future laws or regulations concerning and limitations imposed on our operations by virtue of climate change and GHG emissions laws and regulations. The potential costs of ""allowances,"" ""offsets"" or ""credits"" that may be part of potential cap-and-trade programs or similar future regulatory measures are still uncertain. Any adopted future climate change and GHG regulations could negatively impact our ability (and that of our customers and suppliers) to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. From a medium and long-term perspective, as a result of these regulatory initiatives, we may see an increase in costs relating to our assets that emit significant amounts of GHGs. These regulatory initiatives will be either voluntary or mandatory and may impact our operations directly or through our suppliers or customers. Until the timing, scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known, we cannot predict the effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, but such effect could be materially adverse to our business, results of operations and financial condition.RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMPANYPotential limitations on our ability to access credit, or the ability of our customers and suppliers to access credit, may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If our access to credit is limited or impaired, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. Our senior unsecured debt is rated by Standard & Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investors Service. In determining our credit ratings, the rating agencies consider a number of both quantitative and qualitative factors. These factors include earnings (loss), fixed charges such as interest, cash flows, total debt outstanding, off-balance sheet obligations and other commitments, total capitalization and various ratios calculated from these factors. The rating agencies also consider predictability of cash flows, business strategy and diversity, industry conditions and contingencies. Any downgrades in our credit ratings may make raising capital more difficult, increase the cost and affect the terms of future borrowings, affect the terms under which we purchase goods and services and limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities. We could also be adversely affected if our banks refused to honor their contractual commitments or cease lending.We are also exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our customers and suppliers. In certain markets, we have experienced a consolidation among those entities to whom we sell. This consolidation has resulted in an increased credit risk spread among fewer customers, often without a corresponding strengthening of their financial status. If the availability of credit to fund or support the continuation and expansion of our customers' business operations is curtailed or if the cost of that credit is increased, the resulting inability of our customers or of their customers to either access credit or absorb the increased cost of that credit could adversely affect our business by reducing our sales or by increasing our exposure to losses from uncollectible customer accounts. The consequences of such adverse effects could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers, the reduction, delay or cancellation of customer orders, delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase, and bankruptcy of customers, suppliers or other creditors. Any of these events may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.14The potential impact of our customers' non-compliance with existing commercial contracts and commitments, due to insolvency or for any other reason, may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Most consumers of the metals products we sell have been negatively impacted by the recession and the continued slow recovery therefrom. Due to their economic hardship or the contraction in their operations or due to the fact that the prices for many of the products we sell have declined since the customers entered into the contracts with us, some of our customers have sought to renegotiate or cancel their existing purchase commitments. In addition, some of our customers have breached previously agreed upon contracts to buy our products by refusing delivery of the products. Where appropriate, we have and will in the future pursue litigation to recover our damages resulting from customer contract defaults. We also use credit insurance both in the U.S. and internationally to mitigate the risk of customer insolvency. However, it is possible that we may not be capable of recovering all of our insured losses if the insurers with whom our accounts receivable are insured experience significant losses threatening their viability. Additionally, credit insurance policies typically have relatively short policy periods and require pre-approval of customers with maximum insured limits established by the customer. If credit insurers incur large losses, the insurance may be more difficult and more costly to secure and may be on less favorable terms.  In addition, a significant amount of our accounts receivable are considered to be open account uninsured accounts receivable. A large number of our customers defaulting on existing contractual obligations to purchase our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.There can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares of our common stock at all or in any particular amounts.During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the Company to repurchase up to $100.0 million of shares of our common stock. The stock markets in general have experienced substantial price and trading fluctuations, which have resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities that often are unrelated or disproportionate to changes in operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Price volatility over a given period may also cause the average price at which we repurchase our own common stock to exceed the stock's price at a given point in time. In addition, significant changes in the trading price of our common stock and our ability to access capital on terms favorable to us could impact our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock. The timing and amount of any repurchases will be determined by the Company's management based on its evaluation of market conditions, capital allocation alternatives and other factors beyond our control. Our share repurchase program may be modified, suspended, extended or terminated by the Company at any time and without notice. Any failure to repurchase stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact investor confidence in us, thereby negatively impacting our stock price.The agreements governing our notes and our other debt contain financial covenants and impose restrictions on our business. The indenture governing our 4.875% senior notes due 2023 and our 5.375% senior notes due 2027 contains restrictions on our ability to create liens, sell assets, enter into sale and leaseback transactions and consolidate or merge. In addition to these restrictions, our credit facility contains covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things, enter into transactions with affiliates and guarantee the debt of some of our subsidiaries. Our credit facility also requires that we meet certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios, including a maximum debt to capitalization and interest coverage ratios.Other agreements that we may enter into in the future may contain covenants imposing significant restrictions on our business that are similar to, or in addition to, the covenants under our existing agreements. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. The breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the indenture governing the notes or under our other debt agreements. An event of default under our debt agreements would permit some of our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If we were unable to repay debt to our secured lenders or if we incur secured debt in the future, these lenders could proceed against the collateral securing that debt. In addition, acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on the notes. 15We may not be able to successfully identify, consummate or integrate acquisitions, and acquisitions may adversely affect our financial leverage. Part of our business strategy includes pursuing synergistic acquisitions. We have expanded, and plan to continue to expand, our business by making strategic acquisitions and regularly seeking suitable acquisition targets to enhance our growth. We may fund such acquisitions using cash on hand, drawing under our credit facility or accessing the capital markets. To the extent we finance such acquisitions with additional debt, the incurrence of such debt may result in a significant increase in our interest expense and financial leverage, which could be further exacerbated by volatility in the debt capital markets. Further, an increase in our leverage could lead to deterioration in our credit ratings.The pursuit of acquisitions may pose certain risks to us. We may not be able to identify acquisition candidates that fit our criteria for growth and profitability. Even if we are able to identify such candidates, we may not be able to acquire them on terms or financing satisfactory to us. We will incur expenses and dedicate attention and resources associated with the review of acquisition opportunities, whether or not we consummate such acquisitions. Additionally, even if we are able to acquire suitable targets on agreeable terms, we may not be able to successfully integrate their operations with ours. Achieving the anticipated benefits of any acquisition will depend in significant part upon whether we integrate such acquired businesses in an efficient and effective manner. We may not be able to achieve the anticipated operating and cost synergies or long-term strategic benefits of our acquisitions within the anticipated timing or at all. For example, elimination of duplicative costs may not be fully achieved or may take longer than anticipated. The benefits from any acquisition will be offset by the costs incurred in integrating the businesses and operations. We may also assume liabilities in connection with acquisitions to which we would not otherwise be exposed. An inability to realize any or all of the anticipated synergies or other benefits of an acquisition as well as any delays that may be encountered in the integration process, which may delay the timing of such synergies or other benefits, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Goodwill impairment charges in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We review the recoverability of goodwill annually, as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter, and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable. As a result of our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal 2017, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $2.0 million related to a reporting unit in our International Marketing and Distribution segment due to management's decision to wind-down the associated operations.The impairment tests require us to make an estimate of the fair value of our reporting units and other long-lived assets. An impairment could be recorded as a result of changes in assumptions, estimates or circumstances, some of which are beyond our control. Factors which could result in an impairment include, but are not limited to: (i) reduced demand for our products; (ii) the cost of capital; (iii) higher material prices; (iv) slower growth rates in our industry; and (v) changes in the market based discount rates. Since a number of factors may influence determinations of fair value of goodwill, we are unable to predict whether impairments of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangibles will occur in the future and there can be no assurance that continued conditions will not result in future impairments of goodwill. The future occurrence of a potential indicator of impairment could include matters such as (i) a decrease in expected net earnings, (ii) adverse equity market conditions, (iii) a decline in current market multiples, (iv) a decline in our common stock price, (v) a significant adverse change in legal factors or the general business climate, (vi) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, (vii) a significant downturn in non-residential construction markets in the U.S. and (viii) continued levels of imported steel into the U.S. Any such impairment would result in us recognizing a non-cash charge in our consolidated statements of earnings, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and increase our effective tax rate. Impairment of long-lived assets in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We have a significant amount of property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets that may be subject to impairment testing. Long-lived assets are subject to an impairment assessment when certain triggering events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may be impaired. If the net carrying value of the asset or group of assets exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows of the operations related to the asset, the excess of the net book value over estimated fair value is charged to impairment loss in the consolidated statements of earnings. The primary factors that affect estimates of future cash flows for these long-lived asset groups are (i) management's scrap price outlook, (ii) scrap demand, (iii) working capital changes, (iv) capital expenditures and (v) selling, general and administrative expenses. For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017, our long-lived asset impairment charges were not material. However, there can be no assurance that continued market conditions, demand for our products, or facility utilization levels or other factors will not result in future impairment charges.16Increases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. An increase in the value of the U.S. dollar may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, and in particular, the increased strength of the U.S. dollar as compared to China's renminbi or the euro could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. A strong U.S. dollar makes imported metal products less expensive, resulting in more imports of steel products into the U.S. by our foreign competitors, while a weak U.S. dollar may have the opposite impact on imports. With the exception of exports of nonferrous scrap metal by our Americas Recycling segment, we have not recently been a significant exporter of metal products from our U.S. operations. Economic difficulties in some large steel-producing regions of the world, resulting in lower local demand for steel products, have historically encouraged greater steel exports to the U.S. at depressed prices which can be exacerbated by a strong U.S. dollar. As a result, our products that are made in the U.S. may become relatively more expensive as compared to imported steel, which has had and in the future could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.A strong U.S. dollar may also hamper our international marketing and distribution business. Weak local currencies limit the amount of U.S. dollar denominated products that we can import for our international operations and limit our ability to be competitive against local producers selling in local currencies.The U.S. dollar and most global currencies are subject to daily price volatility based on several factors including changes in local government interest rates, macro events and developments, currency manipulation by governments in countries that buy or sell foreign currencies to strengthen or weaken the local currency or in those instances where local governments fix the pricing of their currencies versus having floating exchange rates. Operating internationally carries risks and uncertainties which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our foreign operations generated approximately 24% of our fiscal 2017 net sales. We have significant facilities in Poland. Our marketing and trading offices are located in most major markets of the world, and our suppliers and customers are located throughout the world. Our International Marketing and Distribution segment relies on substantial international shipments of materials and products in the ordinary course of its business. Our stability, growth and profitability are subject to a number of risks inherent in doing business internationally in addition to the currency exchange risk discussed above, including:•political, military, terrorist or major pandemic events;•local labor and social issues;•legal and regulatory requirements or limitations imposed by foreign governments (particularly those with significant steel consumption or steel-related production including China, Brazil, Russia and India), including quotas, tariffs or other protectionist trade barriers, adverse tax law changes, nationalization or currency restrictions; •disruptions or delays in shipments caused by customs compliance or government agencies; and •potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations.These factors may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.17We rely on the availability of large amounts of electricity and natural gas for our mill operations. Disruptions in delivery or substantial increases in energy costs, including crude oil prices, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our EAF mills melt steel scrap in electric arc furnaces and use natural gas to heat steel billets for rolling into finished products. As large consumers of electricity and gas, often the largest in the geographic area where our mills are located, we must have dependable delivery of electricity and natural gas in order to operate. Accordingly, we are at risk in the event of an energy disruption. Prolonged black-outs or brown-outs or disruptions caused by natural disasters such as hurricanes would substantially disrupt our production. While we have not suffered prolonged production delays due to our inability to access electricity or natural gas, several of our competitors have experienced such occurrences. Prolonged substantial increases in energy costs would have an adverse effect on the costs of operating our mills and would negatively impact our gross margins unless we were able to fully pass through the additional expense to our customers. Our finished steel products are typically delivered by truck. Rapid increases in the price of fuel attributable to increases in crude oil prices would increase our costs and adversely affect many of our customers' financial results, which in turn could result in reduced margins and declining demand for our products. Rapid increases in fuel costs may also negatively impact our ability to charter ships for international deliveries at anticipated freight rates, thereby decreasing our margins on those transactions or causing our customers to look for alternative sources.The loss of or inability to hire key employees may adversely affect our ability to successfully manage our operations and meet our strategic objectives. Our future success depends, in large part, on the continued service of our officers and other key employees and our ability to continue to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel. These employees are integral to our success based on their expertise and knowledge of our business and products. We compete for such personnel with other companies, including public and private company competitors who may periodically offer more favorable terms of employment. The loss or interruption of the services of a number of our key employees could reduce our ability to effectively manage our operations due to the fact that we may not be able to find appropriate replacement personnel in a timely manner should the need arise.We may have difficulty competing with companies that have a lower cost structure or access to greater financial resources. We compete with regional, national and foreign manufacturers and traders. Consolidation among participants in the steel manufacturing and recycling industries has resulted in fewer competitors, and several of our competitors are significantly larger than us and have greater financial resources and more diverse businesses than us. Some of our foreign competitors may be able to pursue business opportunities without regard to certain of the laws and regulations with which we must comply, such as environmental regulations. These companies may have a lower cost structure and more operating flexibility, and consequently they may be able to offer better prices and more services than we can. There is no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with these companies. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Information technology interruptions and breaches in data security could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.We rely on computers, information and communications technology and related systems and networks in order to operate our business, including to store sensitive data such as intellectual property, our own proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners and personally identifiable information of our employees. Increased global information technology security requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and a rise in sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems, networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Our systems and networks are also subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, employee error and other similar events. Any of these or other events could result in system interruption, the disclosure, modification or destruction of proprietary and other key information, legal claims or proceedings, production delays or disruptions to operations including processing transactions and reporting financial results and could adversely impact our reputation and our operating results. We have taken steps to address these concerns and have implemented internal control and security measures to protect our systems and networks from security breaches; however, there can be no assurance that a system or network failure, or security breach, will not impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.18Our mills require continual capital investments that we may not be able to sustain. We must make regular substantial capital investments in our steel mills to maintain the mills, lower production costs and remain competitive. We cannot be certain that we will have sufficient internally generated cash or acceptable external financing to make necessary substantial capital expenditures in the future. The availability of external financing depends on many factors outside of our control, including capital market conditions and the overall performance of the economy. If funding is insufficient, we may be unable to develop or enhance our mills, take advantage of business opportunities and respond to competitive pressures.Scrap and other supplies for our business are subject to significant price fluctuations and limited availability, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. At any given time, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of critical raw materials with a price and other terms acceptable to us. We depend on ferrous scrap, the primary feedstock for our steel mills, and other supplies such as graphite electrodes and ferroalloys for our steel mill operations. The price of scrap and other supplies has historically been subject to significant fluctuation, and we may not be able to adjust our product prices to recover the costs of rapid increases in material prices, especially over the short-term and in our domestic fabrication segment's fixed price contracts. The profitability of our steel mill operations and domestic fabrication segments would be adversely affected if we are unable to pass on to our customers increased raw material and supply costs. Changing processes could potentially impact the volume of scrap metal available to us and the volume and realized margins of processed metal we sell. The purchase prices for automobile bodies and various other grades of obsolete and industrial scrap, as well as the selling prices for processed and recycled scrap metals we utilize in our own manufacturing process or resell to others, are highly volatile. A prolonged period of low scrap prices or a fall in scrap prices could reduce our ability to obtain, process and sell recycled material, which could have a material adverse effect on our metals recycling operations business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices may be limited by competitive or other factors during periods of low scrap prices, when the supply of scrap may decline considerably, as scrap generators hold onto their scrap in the hope of getting higher prices later; conversely, increased foreign demand for scrap due to economic expansion in countries such as China, India, Brazil and Turkey can result in an outflow of available domestic scrap as well as higher scrap prices that cannot always be passed on to domestic scrap consumers, further reducing the available domestic scrap flows and scrap margins, all of which could adversely affect our sales and profitability.  Our Arkansas rerolling mill does not have melting capacity, so it is dependent on an adequate supply of competitively priced semi–finished billets either from our mini mills or competitors. Occasionally, our Arkansas rerolling mill utilizes used rail as a feedstock instead of billets, primarily from railroad abandonments or replacements. The inability to source billets internally or purchase competitively priced billets from other sources could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.The availability and process of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations, allocations by suppliers, interruptions in production, accidents or natural disasters, changes in exchange rates, worldwide price fluctuations, and the availability and cost of transportation. If we were unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials, we may be unable to timely manufacture significant quantities of our products. Unexpected equipment failures may lead to production curtailments or shutdowns, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Interruptions in our production capabilities would adversely affect our production costs, steel available for sale and earnings for the affected period. Our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of steel-making equipment, such as our furnaces, continuous casters and rolling equipment, as well as electrical equipment, such as transformers. This equipment may, on occasion, be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, material plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such equipment failures. In addition to equipment failures, our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, explosions or violent weather conditions.19Operating and start-up risks, as well as commodity and market risks associated with our new micro mill in Durant, Oklahoma could prevent us from realizing anticipated benefits and could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our investment. Although we have successfully commissioned and operated similar technology in Mesa, Arizona, there are technological, operational, market and start-up risks associated with the construction and start-up of our micro mill in Durant, Oklahoma. We believe this micro mill should be capable of consistently producing high-quality reinforcing bar and other products, and in sufficient quantities and at a cost that will compare favorably with other similar steel manufacturing facilities; however, there can be no assurance that these expectations will be achieved. If we encounter cost overruns, systems or process difficulties during or after start-up or quality control restrictions, our capital costs could materially increase, the expected cost benefits from the development of this micro mill could be diminished or lost, and we could lose all or a substantial portion of our investment. We could also encounter commodity market risk if, during a sustained period, the cost to manufacture is greater than projected.Competition from other materials may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In many applications, steel competes with other materials, such as aluminum and plastics (particularly in the automobile industry), cement, composites, glass and wood. Increased use of or additional substitutes for steel products could adversely affect future market prices and demand for steel products.Hedging transactions may expose us to losses or limit our potential gains. Our product lines and worldwide operations expose us to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. As part of our risk management program, we use financial instruments, including metals commodity futures, natural gas forward contracts, freight forward contracts, foreign currency exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts. While intended to reduce the effects of the fluctuations, these transactions may limit our potential gains or expose us to losses. If our counterparties to such transactions or the sponsors of the exchanges through which these transactions are offered, such as the London Metal Exchange, fail to honor their obligations due to financial distress, we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipated gains from these transactions.We enter into the foreign currency exchange forward contracts as economic hedges of trade commitments or anticipated commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency to mitigate the effects of changes in currency rates. These foreign exchange commitments are dependent on timely performance by our counterparties. Their failure to perform could result in our having to close these hedges without the anticipated underlying transaction and could result in losses if foreign currency exchange rates have changed.We are subject to litigation and legal compliance risks which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are involved in various litigation matters, including regulatory proceedings, administrative proceedings, governmental investigations, environmental matters and construction contract disputes. The nature of our operations also exposes us to possible litigation claims in the future. Because of the uncertain nature of litigation and coverage decisions, we cannot predict the outcome of these matters. These matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Litigation is very costly, and the costs associated with prosecuting and defending litigation matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure to loss in connection with litigation matters, we make accruals as warranted. However, the amounts that we accrue could vary significantly from the amounts we actually pay, due to inherent uncertainties and the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process, the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors. See Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a description of our current significant legal proceedings.As noted above, existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, and future laws and regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See the risk factor ""Compliance with and changes in environmental compliance requirements and remediation requirements could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs; violations of environmental requirements could result in costs that have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition"" above for a description of such risks relating to environmental laws and regulations. In addition to such environmental laws and regulations, complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, including without limitation the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws in other countries, which generally prohibit companies and those acting on their behalf from making improper payments to foreign 20government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, regulations related to import-export controls, the Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions program and antiboycott provisions, may increase our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and expose us and our employees to elevated risk. While we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs, the nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist. A negative outcome in an unusual or significant legal proceeding or compliance investigation could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Some of our operations present significant risk of injury or death. The industrial activities conducted at certain of our facilities present significant risk of serious injury or death to our employees, customers or other visitors to our operations, notwithstanding our safety precautions, including our material compliance with federal, state and local employee health and safety regulations, and we may be unable to avoid material liabilities for injuries or deaths. We maintain workers' compensation insurance to address the risk of incurring material liabilities for injuries or deaths, but there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage will be adequate or will continue to be available on the terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could result in material liabilities to us for any injuries or deaths.Health care legislation could result in substantially increased costs and adversely affect our workforce. The health care mandates enacted in connection with the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act may cause us to evaluate the scope of health benefits offered to our workforce and the method in which they are delivered, and increase our and our employees' costs. If we are not able to offer a competitive level of benefits, our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel may be adversely affected. Higher health care costs may result in (i) an inability to reinvest sufficient capital in our operations, (ii) an inability to sustain dividends, (iii) lowered debt ratings and (iv) an increase in the cost of capital, all of which may have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition"
4,CMC,COMMERCIAL METALS,2016-10-31,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSThere are inherent risks and uncertainties associated with our business that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Set forth below are descriptions of those risks and uncertainties that we currently believe to be material, but the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRYOur industry and the industries we serve are vulnerable to global economic conditions, including the slow recovery from the last recession and the risk of a recession relapse. Metals industries and commodity products have historically been vulnerable to significant declines in consumption, global overcapacity and product pricing during prolonged periods of economic downturn. Our business supports cyclical industries such as commercial, residential and government construction, energy, metals service center, petrochemical and original equipment manufacturing. We may experience significant fluctuations in demand for our products from these industries based on the global or regional economic conditions, energy prices, consumer demand and decisions by governments to fund infrastructure projects such as highways, schools, energy plants and airports. Although the residential housing market is not a significant direct factor in our business, related commercial and infrastructure construction activities, such as shopping centers, schools and roads, could be adversely impacted by a prolonged slump in new housing construction. Our business, results of operations and financial condition are adversely affected when the industries we serve suffer a prolonged downturn or anemic growth. Because we do not have unlimited backlogs, our business, results of operations and financial condition are promptly affected by short-term economic fluctuations.Eight years removed from the worldwide economic downturn that began in 2008, we have begun to see some improvement in general economic and manufacturing activity, but the economic outlook remains uncertain both in the United States and globally. In addition, uncertainties in Europe regarding the financial sector and sovereign debt and the potential impact on banks in other regions of the world have continued to weigh on global and domestic growth. These situations continue to contribute to weaker end-markets and depressed demand, which could stifle customer confidence and adversely affect demand for our products and further adversely affect our business. Although we believe that the long-term prospects for the steel industry remain bright, we are unable to predict the duration of current economic conditions that are contributing to reduced demand for our products compared to pre-recession levels. Future economic downturns or a prolonged period of slow growth or economic stagnation could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.12We are vulnerable to the economic conditions in the regions in which our operations are concentrated.Our geographic concentration in the southern and southwestern United States as well as Central Europe, Australia, China and the Middle East exposes us to the local market conditions in these regions. Economic downturns in these areas or decisions by governments that have an impact on the level and pace of overall economic activity in one of these regions could adversely affect demand for our products and, consequently, our sales and profitability. As a result, our financial results are substantially dependent upon the overall economic conditions in these areas. There is substantial uncertainty regarding the impact of the Referendum of the United Kingdom’s (“U.K.”) Membership of the European Union (“EU”) (referred to as “Brexit”) held in June 2016, where a majority of voters in the U.K. voted in favor of the U.K. leaving the EU, and negotiations are expected to commence to determine the future terms of the U.K.’s relationship with the EU, including the terms of trade between the U.K. and the EU. Potential adverse consequences of Brexit such as global market uncertainty, volatility in currency exchange rates, greater restrictions on imports and exports between the U.K. and EU countries and increased regulatory complexities could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Rapid and significant changes in the price of metals could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Prices for most metals in which we deal have experienced increased volatility over the last several years, and such increased price volatility impacts us in several ways. Some of our operations, such as our fabrication operations, may benefit from rapidly decreasing steel prices as their material cost for previously contracted fixed price work declines. Others, such as our Americas Mills and International Mill segments, would likely experience reduced margins and may be forced to liquidate high cost inventory at reduced margins or losses until prices stabilize. Sudden increases could have the opposite effect in each case. Overall, we believe that rapid substantial price changes are not to our industry's benefit. Our customer and supplier base would be impacted due to uncertainty as to future prices. A reluctance to purchase inventory in the face of extreme price decreases or to sell quickly during a period of rapid price increases would likely reduce our volume of business. Marginal industry participants or speculators may attempt to participate to an unhealthy extent during a period of rapid price escalation with a substantial risk of contract default if prices suddenly reverse. Risks of default in contract performance by customers or suppliers as well as an increased risk of bad debts and customer credit exposure could increase during periods of rapid and substantial price changes.Excess capacity and over-production by foreign producers in our industry could increase the level of steel imports into the United States, resulting in lower domestic prices, which would adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability. Global steel-making capacity exceeds demand for steel products in some regions around the world. Rather than reducing employment by rationalizing capacity with consumption, steel manufacturers in these countries (often with local government assistance or subsidies in various forms) have traditionally periodically exported steel at prices significantly below their home market prices, which prices may not reflect their costs of production or capital. For example, steel production in China, the world's largest producer and consumer of steel, has continued to exceed Chinese demand. This rising excess capacity in China has resulted in a further increase in imports of artificially low-priced steel and steel products to the United States and world steel markets. A continuation of this trend or a significant decrease in China's rate of economic expansion could result in increasing steel imports from China. Excessive imports of steel into the United States have exerted, and may continue to exert, downward pressure on U.S. steel prices, which negatively affects our ability to increase our sales, margins, and profitability. The excess capacity may create downward pressure on our steel prices and lead to reduced sales volumes as imports absorb market share that would otherwise be filled by domestic supply, all of which would adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability and could subject us to possible renegotiation of contracts or increases in bad debt. We believe the downward pressure on, and periodically depressed levels of, U.S. steel prices in some recent years have been further exacerbated by imports of steel involving dumping and subsidy abuses by foreign steel producers. While some tariffs and quotas are periodically put into effect for certain steel products imported from a number of countries that have been found to have been unfairly pricing steel imports to the U.S., there is no assurance that tariffs and quotas will always be levied, even if otherwise justified, and even when imposed many of these are short-lived. When such tariffs or duties expire or if others are further relaxed or repealed, or if relatively higher U.S. steel prices make it attractive for foreign steelmakers to export their steel products to the U.S., despite the presence of duties or tariffs, the resurgence of substantial imports of foreign steel could create downward pressure on U.S. steel prices.Excess capacity has also led to greater protectionism as is evident in raw material and finished product border tariffs put in place by China, Brazil and other countries. Such protectionism could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.13Compliance with and changes in environmental compliance requirements and remediation requirements could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs; violations of environmental requirements could result in costs that have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, and future laws and regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is a significant factor in our business. We are subject to local, state, federal and international environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other matters, waste disposal, air emissions, waste and storm water effluent and disposal and employee health. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may seek injunctive relief impacting continuing operations for non-compliance with environmental requirements. New facilities that we may build, especially steel mills, like the micro-mill we are building in Durant, Oklahoma, are required to obtain several environmental permits before significant construction or commencement of operations. Delays in obtaining permits or unanticipated conditions in such permits could delay the project or increase construction costs or operating expenses. Our manufacturing and recycling operations produce significant amounts of by-products, some of which are handled as industrial waste or hazardous waste. For example, our mills generate electric arc furnace dust (""EAF dust""), which the EPA and other regulatory authorities classify as hazardous waste. EAF dust and other industrial waste and hazardous waste require special handling, recycling or disposal.In addition, the primary feed materials for the shredders operated by our scrap metal recycling facilities are automobile hulks and obsolete household appliances. Approximately 20% of the weight of an automobile hull consists of unrecyclable material known as shredder fluff. After the segregation of ferrous and saleable nonferrous metals, shredder fluff remains. We, along with others in the recycling industry, interpret federal regulations to require shredder fluff to meet certain criteria and pass a toxic leaching test to avoid classification as a hazardous waste. We also endeavor to remove hazardous contaminants from the feed material prior to shredding. As a result, we believe the shredder fluff we generate is not normally considered or properly classified as hazardous waste. If the laws, regulations or testing methods change with regard to EAF dust or shredder fluff or other by-products, we may incur additional significant costs.Changes to National Ambient Air Quality Standards (""NAAQS"") or other requirements on our air emissions could make it more difficult to obtain new permits or to modify existing permits and could require changes to our operations or emissions control equipment. Such difficulties and changes could result in operational delays and capital and ongoing compliance expenditures.Legal requirements are changing frequently and are subject to interpretation. New laws, regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities, together with uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels, testing and sampling procedures, new pollution control technology and cost/benefit analysis based on market conditions are all factors that may increase our future expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. Accordingly, we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of future compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. We cannot predict whether such costs would be able to be passed on to customers through product price increases. Competitors in various regions or countries where environmental regulation is less restrictive, subject to different interpretation or generally not enforced, may enjoy a competitive advantage.We may also be required to conduct additional cleanup (and pay for associated natural resource damages) at sites where we have already participated in remediation efforts or take remediation action with regard to sites formerly used in connection with our operations. We may be required to pay for a portion or all of the costs of cleanup or remediation at sites we never owned or on which we never operated if we are found to have arranged for treatment or disposal of hazardous substances on the sites. In cases of joint and several liability, we may be obligated to pay a disproportionate share of cleanup costs if other responsible parties are financially insolvent.We are involved and may in the future become involved in various environmental matters that may result in fines, penalties or judgments being assessed against us or liability imposed upon us which we cannot presently estimate or reasonably foresee and which may have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Under CERCLA or similar state statutes, we may have obligations to conduct investigation and remediation activities associated with alleged releases of hazardous substances or to reimburse the EPA (or state agencies as applicable) for such activities and to pay for natural resource damages associated with alleged releases. We have been named a PRP at several federal and state Superfund sites because the EPA or an equivalent state agency contends that we and other potentially responsible scrap metal suppliers are liable for the cleanup of those sites as a result of having sold scrap metal to unrelated manufacturers for recycling as a raw material in the manufacture of new products. We are involved in litigation or administrative proceedings with regard to several of these sites in which we are contesting, or at the appropriate time may contest, our liability. In addition, we have received information requests with regard to other sites which may be under consideration by the EPA as potential CERCLA sites.14We are presently participating in PRP organizations at several sites, which are paying for certain remediation expenses. Although we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure to loss in connection with various environmental matters or the effect on our consolidated financial position, we make accruals as warranted. In addition, although we do not believe that a reasonably possible range of loss in excess of amounts accrued for pending lawsuits, claims or proceedings would be material to our financial statements, additional developments may occur, and due to inherent uncertainties, including evolving remediation technology, changing regulations, possible third-party contributions, the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process, the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors, the amounts we ultimately are required to pay could vary significantly from the amounts we accrue, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Increased regulation associated with climate change and greenhouse gas emissions could impose significant additional costs on both our steelmaking and metals recycling operations. The U.S. government and various governmental agencies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impact of climate change. International treaties or agreements may also result in increasing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, including the introduction of carbon emissions trading mechanisms. Any such regulation regarding climate change and greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions could impose significant costs on our steelmaking and metals recycling operations and on the operations of our customers and suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs in order to comply with current or future laws or regulations concerning and limitations imposed on our operations by virtue of climate change and GHG emissions laws and regulations. The potential costs of ""allowances,"" ""offsets"" or ""credits"" that may be part of potential cap-and-trade programs or similar future regulatory measures are still uncertain. Any adopted future climate change and GHG regulations could negatively impact our ability (and that of our customers and suppliers) to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. From a medium and long-term perspective, as a result of these regulatory initiatives, we may see an increase in costs relating to our assets that emit significant amounts of GHGs. These regulatory initiatives will be either voluntary or mandatory and may impact our operations directly or through our suppliers or customers. Until the timing, scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known, we cannot predict the effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, but such effect could be materially adverse to our business, results of operations and financial condition.RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMPANYPotential limitations on our ability to access credit, or the ability of our customers and suppliers to access credit, may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If our access to credit is limited or impaired, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. Our senior unsecured debt is rated by Standard & Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investors Service. In determining our credit ratings, the rating agencies consider a number of both quantitative and qualitative factors. These factors include earnings (loss), fixed charges such as interest, cash flows, total debt outstanding, off-balance sheet obligations and other commitments, total capitalization and various ratios calculated from these factors. The rating agencies also consider predictability of cash flows, business strategy and diversity, industry conditions and contingencies. Any downgrades in our credit ratings may make raising capital more difficult, increase the cost and affect the terms of future borrowings, affect the terms under which we purchase goods and services and limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities. We could also be adversely affected if our banks refused to honor their contractual commitments or cease lending.We are also exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our customers and suppliers. In certain markets, we have experienced a consolidation among those entities to whom we sell. This consolidation has resulted in an increased credit risk spread among fewer customers, often without a corresponding strengthening of their financial status. If the availability of credit to fund or support the continuation and expansion of our customers' business operations is curtailed or if the cost of that credit is increased, the resulting inability of our customers or of their customers to either access credit or absorb the increased cost of that credit could adversely affect our business by reducing our sales or by increasing our exposure to losses from uncollectible customer accounts. The consequences of such adverse effects could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers, the reduction, delay or cancellation of customer orders, delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase, and bankruptcy of customers, suppliers or other creditors. Any of these events may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.15The potential impact of our customers' non-compliance with existing commercial contracts and commitments, due to insolvency or for any other reason, may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Most consumers of the metals products we sell have been negatively impacted by the recession and the continued slow recovery therefrom. Due to their economic hardship or the contraction in their operations or due to the fact that the prices for many of the products we sell have declined since the customers entered into the contracts with us, some of our customers have sought to renegotiate or cancel their existing purchase commitments. In addition, some of our customers have breached previously agreed upon contracts to buy our products by refusing delivery of the products. Where appropriate, we have and will in the future pursue litigation to recover our damages resulting from customer contract defaults. We also use credit insurance both in the United States and internationally to mitigate the risk of customer insolvency. However, it is possible that we may not be capable of recovering all of our insured losses if the insurers with whom our accounts receivable are insured experience significant losses threatening their viability. Additionally, credit insurance policies typically have relatively short policy periods and require pre-approval of customers with maximum insured limits established by the customer. If credit insurers incur large losses, the insurance may be more difficult and more costly to secure and may be on less favorable terms.  In addition, a significant amount of our accounts receivable are considered to be open account uninsured accounts receivable. A large number of our customers defaulting on existing contractual obligations to purchase our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.There can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares of our common stock at all or in any particular amounts.During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the Company to repurchase up to $100.0 million of shares of our common stock. The stock markets in general have experienced substantial price and trading fluctuations, which have resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities that often are unrelated or disproportionate to changes in operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Price volatility over a given period may also cause the average price at which we repurchase our own common stock to exceed the stock's price at a given point in time. In addition, significant changes in the trading price of our common stock and our ability to access capital on terms favorable to us could impact our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock. The timing and amount of any repurchases will be determined by the Company's management based on its evaluation of market conditions, capital allocation alternatives and other factors beyond our control. Our share repurchase program may be modified, suspended, extended or terminated by the Company at any time and without notice. Any failure to repurchase stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact investor confidence in us, thereby negatively impacting our stock price.The agreements governing our notes and our other debt contain financial covenants and impose restrictions on our business. The indenture governing our 6.50% notes due 2017, 7.35% notes due 2018 and 4.875% notes due 2023 contains restrictions on our ability to create liens, sell assets, enter into sale and leaseback transactions and consolidate or merge. In addition to these restrictions, our credit facility contains covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things, enter into transactions with affiliates and guarantee the debt of some of our subsidiaries. Our credit facility also requires that we meet certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios, including a maximum debt to capitalization and interest coverage ratios.Other agreements that we may enter into in the future may contain covenants imposing significant restrictions on our business that are similar to, or in addition to, the covenants under our existing agreements. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. The breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the indenture governing the notes or under our other debt agreements. An event of default under our debt agreements would permit some of our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If we were unable to repay debt to our secured lenders or if we incur secured debt in the future, these lenders could proceed against the collateral securing that debt. In addition, acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on the notes.16Increases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. An increase in the value of the U.S. dollar may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, and in particular, the increased strength of the U.S. dollar as compared to China's renminbi or the euro could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. A strong U.S. dollar makes imported metal products less expensive, resulting in more imports of steel products into the United States by our foreign competitors, while a weak U.S. dollar may have the opposite impact on imports. With the exception of exports of nonferrous scrap metal by our Americas Recycling segment, we have not recently been a significant exporter of metal products from our United States operations. Economic difficulties in some large steel-producing regions of the world, resulting in lower local demand for steel products, have historically encouraged greater steel exports to the United States at depressed prices which can be exacerbated by a strong U.S. dollar. As a result, our products that are made in the United States may become relatively more expensive as compared to imported steel, which has had and in the future could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.A strong U.S. dollar may also hamper our international marketing and distribution business. Weak local currencies limit the amount of U.S. dollar denominated products that we can import for our international operations and limit our ability to be competitive against local producers selling in local currencies.The U.S. dollar and most global currencies are subject to daily price volatility based on several factors including changes in local government interest rates, macro events and developments, currency manipulation by governments in countries that buy or sell foreign currencies to strengthen or weaken the local currency or in those instances where local governments fix the pricing of their currencies versus having floating exchange rates. Operating internationally carries risks and uncertainties which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our foreign operations generated approximately 23% of our fiscal 2016 net sales. We have significant facilities in Poland. Our marketing and trading offices are located in most major markets of the world, and our suppliers and customers are located throughout the world. Our marketing and distribution segment relies on substantial international shipments of materials and products in the ordinary course of its business. Our stability, growth and profitability are subject to a number of risks inherent in doing business internationally in addition to the currency exchange risk discussed above, including:•political, military, terrorist or major pandemic events;•local labor and social issues;•legal and regulatory requirements or limitations imposed by foreign governments (particularly those with significant steel consumption or steel-related production including China, Brazil, Russia and India), including quotas, tariffs or other protectionist trade barriers, adverse tax law changes, nationalization or currency restrictions; •disruptions or delays in shipments caused by customs compliance or government agencies; and •potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations.These factors may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.We rely on the availability of large amounts of electricity and natural gas for our mill operations. Disruptions in delivery or substantial increases in energy costs, including crude oil prices, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Minimills melt steel scrap in electric arc furnaces and use natural gas to heat steel billets for rolling into finished products. As large consumers of electricity and gas, often the largest in the geographic area where our minimills are located, we must have dependable delivery of electricity and natural gas in order to operate. Accordingly, we are at risk in the event of an energy disruption. Prolonged black-outs or brown-outs or disruptions caused by natural disasters such as hurricanes would substantially disrupt our production. While we have not suffered prolonged production delays due to our inability to access electricity or natural gas, several of our competitors have experienced such occurrences. Prolonged substantial increases in energy costs would have an adverse effect on the costs of operating our minimills and would negatively impact our gross margins unless we were able to fully pass through the additional expense to our customers. Our finished steel products are typically delivered by truck. Rapid increases in the price of fuel attributable to increases in crude oil prices would increase our costs and adversely affect many of our customers' 17financial results, which in turn could result in reduced margins and declining demand for our products. Rapid increases in fuel costs may also negatively impact our ability to charter ships for international deliveries at anticipated freight rates, thereby decreasing our margins on those transactions or causing our customers to look for alternative sources.The loss of or inability to hire key employees may adversely affect our ability to successfully manage our operations and meet our strategic objectives. Our future success depends, in large part, on the continued service of our officers and other key employees and our ability to continue to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel. These employees are integral to our success based on their expertise and knowledge of our business and products. We compete for such personnel with other companies, including public and private company competitors who may periodically offer more favorable terms of employment. The loss or interruption of the services of a number of our key employees could reduce our ability to effectively manage our operations due to the fact that we may not be able to find appropriate replacement personnel in a timely manner should the need arise.We may have difficulty competing with companies that have a lower cost structure or access to greater financial resources. We compete with regional, national and foreign manufacturers and traders. Consolidation among participants in the steel manufacturing and recycling industries has resulted in fewer competitors, and several of our competitors are significantly larger than us and have greater financial resources and more diverse businesses than us. Some of our foreign competitors may be able to pursue business opportunities without regard to certain of the laws and regulations with which we must comply, such as environmental regulations. These companies may have a lower cost structure and more operating flexibility, and consequently they may be able to offer better prices and more services than we can. There is no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with these companies. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Information technology interruptions and breaches in data security could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.We rely on computers, information and communications technology and related systems and networks in order to operate our business, including to store sensitive data such as intellectual property, our own proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners and personally identifiable information of our employees. Increased global information technology security requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and a rise in sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems, networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Our systems and networks are also subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, employee error and other similar events. Any of these or other events could result in system interruption, the disclosure, modification or destruction of proprietary and other key information, legal claims or proceedings, production delays or disruptions to operations including processing transactions and reporting financial results and could adversely impact our reputation and our operating results. We have taken steps to address these concerns and have implemented internal control and security measures to protect our systems and networks from security breaches; however, there can be no assurance that a system or network failure, or security breach, will not impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our mills require continual capital investments that we may not be able to sustain. We must make regular substantial capital investments in our steel mills to maintain the mills, lower production costs and remain competitive. We cannot be certain that we will have sufficient internally generated cash or acceptable external financing to make necessary substantial capital expenditures in the future. The availability of external financing depends on many factors outside of our control, including capital market conditions and the overall performance of the economy. If funding is insufficient, we may be unable to develop or enhance our mills, take advantage of business opportunities and respond to competitive pressures.Scrap and other supplies for our business are subject to significant price fluctuations and limited availability, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. At any given time, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of critical raw materials with a price and other terms acceptable to us. We depend on ferrous scrap, the primary feedstock for our steel mills, and other supplies such as graphite electrodes and ferroalloys for our steel mill operations. The price of scrap and other supplies has historically been subject to significant fluctuation, and we may not be able to adjust our product prices to recover the costs of rapid increases in material prices, especially over the short-term and in our domestic fabrication segment's fixed price contracts. The profitability of our steel mill operations and domestic fabrication segments would be adversely affected if we are unable to pass on to our customers increased raw material and supply costs. Changing processes could potentially impact the volume of scrap metal available to us and the volume and realized margins 18of processed metal we sell. The purchase prices for automobile bodies and various other grades of obsolete and industrial scrap, as well as the selling prices for processed and recycled scrap metals we utilize in our own manufacturing process or resell to others, are highly volatile. A prolonged period of low scrap prices or a fall in scrap prices could reduce our ability to obtain, process and sell recycled material, which could have a material adverse effect on our metals recycling operations business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices may be limited by competitive or other factors during periods of low scrap prices, when the supply of scrap may decline considerably, as scrap generators hold onto their scrap in the hope of getting higher prices later; conversely, increased foreign demand for scrap due to economic expansion in countries such as China, India, Brazil and Turkey can result in an outflow of available domestic scrap as well as higher scrap prices that cannot always be passed on to domestic scrap consumers, further reducing the available domestic scrap flows and scrap margins, all of which could adversely affect our sales and profitability.  Our Arkansas mill does not have melting capacity, so it is dependent on an adequate supply of competitively priced used rail. The availability of used rail fluctuates with the pace of railroad abandonments, rail replacement by railroads in the United States and abroad and demand for used rail from other domestic and foreign rail rerolling mills. Price increases for used rail could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.The availability and process of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations, allocations by suppliers, interruptions in production, accidents or natural disasters, changes in exchange rates, worldwide price fluctuations, and the availability and cost of transportation. If we were unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials, we may be unable to timely manufacture significant quantities of our products. Unexpected equipment failures may lead to production curtailments or shutdowns, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Interruptions in our production capabilities would adversely affect our production costs, steel available for sale and earnings for the affected period. Our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of steel-making equipment, such as our furnaces, continuous casters and rolling equipment, as well as electrical equipment, such as transformers. This equipment may, on occasion, be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, material plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such equipment failures. In addition to equipment failures, our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, explosions or violent weather conditions.Competition from other materials may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In many applications, steel competes with other materials, such as aluminum and plastics (particularly in the automobile industry), cement, composites, glass and wood. Increased use of or additional substitutes for steel products could adversely affect future market prices and demand for steel products.Hedging transactions may expose us to losses or limit our potential gains. Our product lines and worldwide operations expose us to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. As part of our risk management program, we use financial instruments, including metals commodity futures, natural gas forward contracts, freight forward contracts, foreign currency exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts. While intended to reduce the effects of the fluctuations, these transactions may limit our potential gains or expose us to losses. If our counterparties to such transactions or the sponsors of the exchanges through which these transactions are offered, such as the London Metal Exchange, fail to honor their obligations due to financial distress, we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipated gains from these transactions.We enter into the foreign currency exchange forward contracts as economic hedges of trade commitments or anticipated commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency to mitigate the effects of changes in currency rates. These foreign exchange commitments are dependent on timely performance by our counterparties. Their failure to perform could result in our having to close these hedges without the anticipated underlying transaction and could result in losses if foreign currency exchange rates have changed.19We are subject to litigation and legal compliance risks which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are involved in various litigation matters, including regulatory proceedings, administrative proceedings, governmental investigations, environmental matters and construction contract disputes. The nature of our operations also exposes us to possible litigation claims in the future. Because of the uncertain nature of litigation and coverage decisions, we cannot predict the outcome of these matters. These matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Litigation is very costly, and the costs associated with prosecuting and defending litigation matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure to loss in connection with litigation matters, we make accruals as warranted. However, the amounts that we accrue could vary significantly from the amounts we actually pay, due to inherent uncertainties and the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process, the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors. See Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a description of our current significant legal proceedings.As noted above, existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, and future laws and regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See the risk factor ""Compliance with and changes in environmental compliance requirements and remediation requirements could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs; violations of environmental requirements could result in costs that have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition"" above for a description of such risks relating to environmental laws and regulations. In addition to such environmental laws and regulations, complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, including without limitation the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws in other countries, which generally prohibit companies and those acting on their behalf from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, regulations related to import-export controls, the Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions program and antiboycott provisions, may increase our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and expose us and our employees to elevated risk. While we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs, the nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist. A negative outcome in an unusual or significant legal proceeding or compliance investigation could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Some of our operations present significant risk of injury or death. The industrial activities conducted at certain of our facilities present significant risk of serious injury or death to our employees, customers or other visitors to our operations, notwithstanding our safety precautions, including our material compliance with federal, state and local employee health and safety regulations, and we may be unable to avoid material liabilities for injuries or deaths. We maintain workers' compensation insurance to address the risk of incurring material liabilities for injuries or deaths, but there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage will be adequate or will continue to be available on the terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could result in material liabilities to us for any injuries or deaths.Health care legislation could result in substantially increased costs and adversely affect our workforce. The health care mandates enacted in connection with the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act may cause us to evaluate the scope of health benefits offered to our workforce and the method in which they are delivered, and increase our and our employees' costs. If we are not able to offer a competitive level of benefits, our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel may be adversely affected. Higher health care costs may result in (i) an inability to reinvest sufficient capital in our operations, (ii) an inability to sustain dividends, (iii) lowered debt ratings and (iv) an increase in the cost of capital, all of which may have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition"
11,CMC,COMMERCIAL METALS,2015-10-30,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSThere are inherent risks and uncertainties associated with our business that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Set forth below are descriptions of those risks and uncertainties that we currently believe to be material, but the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRYOur industry and the industries we serve are vulnerable to global economic conditions, including the slow recovery from the recent recession and the risk of a recession relapse. Metals industries and commodity products have historically been vulnerable to significant declines in consumption, global overcapacity and product pricing during prolonged periods of economic downturn. Our business supports cyclical industries such as commercial, residential and government construction, energy, metals service center, petrochemical and original equipment manufacturing. We may experience significant fluctuations in demand for our products from these industries based on the global or regional economic conditions, energy prices, consumer demand and decisions by governments to fund infrastructure projects such as highways, schools, energy plants and airports. Although the residential housing market is not a significant direct factor in our business, related commercial and infrastructure construction activities, such as shopping centers, schools and roads, could be adversely impacted by a prolonged slump in new housing construction. Our business, results of operations and financial condition are adversely affected when the industries we serve suffer a prolonged downturn or anemic growth. Because we do not have unlimited backlogs, our business, results of operations and financial condition are promptly affected by short-term economic fluctuations.Seven years removed from the worldwide economic downturn that began in 2008, we have begun to see some improvement in general economic and manufacturing activity, but the economic outlook remains uncertain both in the United States and globally. In addition, uncertainties in Europe regarding the financial sector and sovereign debt and the potential impact on banks in other regions of the world have continued to weigh on global and domestic growth. These situations continue to contribute to weaker end-markets and depressed demand, which could stifle improving customer confidence and adversely affect demand for our products and further adversely affect our business. Although we believe that the long-term prospects for the steel industry remain bright, we are unable to predict the duration of current economic conditions that are contributing to reduced demand for our products compared to pre-recession levels. Future economic downturns or a prolonged period of slow growth or economic stagnation could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.We are vulnerable to the economic conditions in the regions in which our operations are concentrated.Our geographic concentration in the southern and southwestern United States as well as Central Europe, Australia, China and the Middle East exposes us to the local market conditions in these regions. Economic downturns in these areas or decisions by governments that have an impact on the level and pace of overall economic activity in one of these regions could adversely affect demand for our products and, consequently, our sales and profitability. As a result, our financial results are substantially dependent upon the overall economic conditions in these areas.Rapid and significant changes in the price of metals could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Prices for most metals in which we deal have experienced increased volatility over the last several years, and such increased price 12volatility impacts us in several ways. Some of our operations, such as our fabrication operations, may benefit from rapidly decreasing steel prices as their material cost for previously contracted fixed price work declines. Others, such as our Americas Mills and International Mill segments, would likely experience reduced margins and may be forced to liquidate high cost inventory at reduced margins or losses until prices stabilize. Sudden increases could have the opposite effect. Overall, we believe that rapid substantial price changes are not to our industry's benefit. Our customer and supplier base would be impacted due to uncertainty as to future prices. A reluctance to purchase inventory in the face of extreme price decreases or to sell quickly during a period of rapid price increases would likely reduce our volume of business. Marginal industry participants or speculators may attempt to participate to an unhealthy extent during a period of rapid price escalation with a substantial risk of contract default if prices suddenly reverse. Risks of default in contract performance by customers or suppliers as well as an increased risk of bad debts and customer credit exposure could increase during periods of rapid and substantial price changes.Excess capacity in our industry could increase the level of steel imports into the United States, resulting in lower domestic prices, which would adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability. Global steel-making capacity exceeds demand for steel products in some regions around the world. Rather than reducing employment by rationalizing capacity with consumption, steel manufacturers in these countries (often with local government assistance or subsidies in various forms) have traditionally periodically exported steel at prices significantly below their home market prices, which prices may not reflect their costs of production or capital. For example, steel production in China, the world’s largest producer and consumer of steel, has continued to exceed Chinese demand. This rising excess capacity in China has resulted in a further increase in imports of artificially low-priced steel and steel products to the United States and world steel markets. A continuation of this trend or a significant decrease in China’s rate of economic expansion could result in increasing steel imports from China. Excessive imports of steel into the United States have exerted, and may continue to exert, downward pressure on U.S. steel prices, which negatively affects our ability to increase our sales, margins, and profitability. The excess capacity may create downward pressure on our steel prices which would adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability and could subject us to possible renegotiation of contracts or increases in bad debt. We believe the downward pressure on, and periodically depressed levels of, U.S. steel prices in some recent years have been further exacerbated by imports of steel involving dumping and subsidy abuses by foreign steel producers. While some tariffs and quotas are periodically put into effect for certain steel products imported from a number of countries that have been found to have been unfairly pricing steel imports to the U.S., there is no assurance that tariffs and quotas will always be levied, even if otherwise justified, and even when imposed many of these are only short-lived. When such tariffs or duties expire or if others are further relaxed or repealed, or if relatively higher U.S. steel prices make it attractive for foreign steelmakers to export their steel products to the U.S., despite the presence of duties or tariffs, the resurgence of substantial imports of foreign steel could create downward pressure on U.S. steel prices.Excess capacity has also led to greater protectionism as is evident in raw material and finished product border tariffs put in place by China, Brazil and other countries. Such protectionism could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Compliance with and changes in environmental compliance requirements and remediation requirements could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs; violations of environmental requirements could result in costs that have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, and future laws and regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is a significant factor in our business. We are subject to local, state, federal and international environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other matters, waste disposal, air emissions, waste and storm water effluent and disposal and employee health. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may seek injunctive relief impacting continuing operations for non-compliance with environmental requirements. New facilities that we may build, especially steel minimills, like our proposed minimill in Durant, Oklahoma, are required to obtain several environmental permits before significant construction or commencement of operations. Delays in obtaining permits or unanticipated conditions in such permits could delay the project or increase construction costs or operating expenses. Our manufacturing and recycling operations produce significant amounts of by-products, some of which are handled as industrial waste or hazardous waste. For example, our minimills generate electric arc furnace dust (""EAF dust""), which the EPA and other regulatory authorities classify as hazardous waste. EAF dust and other industrial waste and hazardous waste require special handling, recycling or disposal.13In addition, the primary feed materials for the shredders operated by our scrap metal recycling facilities are automobile hulks and obsolete household appliances. Approximately 20% of the weight of an automobile hull consists of unrecyclable material known as shredder fluff. After the segregation of ferrous and saleable nonferrous metals, shredder fluff remains. We, along with others in the recycling industry, interpret Federal regulations to require shredder fluff to meet certain criteria and pass a toxic leaching test to avoid classification as a hazardous waste. We also endeavor to remove hazardous contaminants from the feed material prior to shredding. As a result, we believe the shredder fluff we generate is not normally considered or properly classified as hazardous waste. If the laws, regulations or testing methods change with regard to EAF dust or shredder fluff or other by-products, we may incur additional significant costs.Changes to National Ambient Air Quality Standards (""NAAQS"") or other requirements on our air emissions could make it more difficult to obtain new permits or to modify existing permits and could require changes to our operations or emissions control equipment. Such difficulties and changes could result in operational delays and capital and on-going compliance expenditures.Legal requirements are changing frequently and are subject to interpretation. New laws, regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities, together with uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels, testing and sampling procedures, new pollution control technology and cost/benefit analysis based on market conditions are all factors that may increase our future expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. Accordingly, we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of future compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. We cannot predict whether such costs would be able to be passed on to customers through product price increases. Competitors in various regions or countries where environmental regulation is less restrictive, subject to different interpretation or generally not enforced, may enjoy a competitive advantage.We may also be required to conduct additional cleanup (and pay for associated natural resource damages) at sites where we have already participated in remediation efforts or to take remediation action with regard to sites formerly used in connection with our operations. We may be required to pay for a portion or all of the costs of cleanup or remediation at sites we never owned or on which we never operated if we are found to have arranged for treatment or disposal of hazardous substances on the sites. In cases of joint and several liability, we may be obligated to pay a disproportionate share of cleanup costs if other responsible parties are financially insolvent.We are involved and may in the future become involved in various environmental matters that may result in fines, penalties or judgments being assessed against us or liability imposed upon us which we cannot presently estimate or reasonably foresee and which may have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Under CERCLA or similar state statutes, we may have obligations to conduct investigation and remediation activities associated with alleged releases of hazardous substances or to reimburse the EPA (or state agencies as applicable) for such activities and to pay for natural resource damages associated with alleged releases. We have been named a PRP at several federal and state Superfund sites because the EPA or an equivalent state agency contends that we and other potentially responsible scrap metal suppliers are liable for the cleanup of those sites as a result of having sold scrap metal to unrelated manufacturers for recycling as a raw material in the manufacture of new products. We are involved in litigation or administrative proceedings with regard to several of these sites in which we are contesting, or at the appropriate time may contest, our liability. In addition, we have received information requests with regard to other sites which may be under consideration by the EPA as potential CERCLA sites.We are presently participating in PRP organizations at several sites, which are paying for certain remediation expenses. Although we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure to loss in connection with various environmental matters or the effect on our consolidated financial position, we make accruals as warranted. In addition, although we do not believe that a reasonably possible range of loss in excess of amounts accrued for pending lawsuits, claims or proceedings would be material to our financial statements, additional developments may occur, and due to inherent uncertainties, including evolving remediation technology, changing regulations, possible third-party contributions, the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process, the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors, the amounts we ultimately are required to pay could vary significantly from the amounts we accrue, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Increased regulation associated with climate change and greenhouse gas emissions could impose significant additional costs on both our steelmaking and metals recycling operations. The U.S. government and various governmental agencies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impact of climate change. International treaties or agreements may also result in increasing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, including the introduction of carbon emissions trading mechanisms. Any such regulation regarding climate change and greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions could impose significant costs on our steelmaking and metals recycling operations and on the operations of our customers and suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs in order to comply with current or future laws or regulations concerning and limitations imposed on our 14operations by virtue of climate change and GHG emissions laws and regulations. The potential costs of ""allowances,"" ""offsets"" or ""credits"" that may be part of potential cap-and-trade programs or similar future regulatory measures are still uncertain. Any adopted future climate change and GHG regulations could negatively impact our ability (and that of our customers and suppliers) to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. From a medium and long-term perspective, as a result of these regulatory initiatives, we may see an increase in costs relating to our assets that emit significant amounts of greenhouse gases. These regulatory initiatives will be either voluntary or mandatory and may impact our operations directly or through our suppliers or customers. Until the timing, scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known, we cannot predict the effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, but such effect could be materially adverse to our business, results of operations and financial condition.RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMPANYPotential limitations on our ability to access credit, or the ability of our customers and suppliers to access credit, may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If our access to credit is limited or impaired, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. Our senior unsecured debt is rated by Standard & Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investors Service. In determining our credit ratings, the rating agencies consider a number of both quantitative and qualitative factors. These factors include earnings (loss), fixed charges such as interest, cash flows, total debt outstanding, off-balance sheet obligations and other commitments, total capitalization and various ratios calculated from these factors. The rating agencies also consider predictability of cash flows, business strategy and diversity, industry conditions and contingencies. Any downgrades in our credit ratings may make raising capital more difficult, increase the cost and affect the terms of future borrowings, affect the terms under which we purchase goods and services and limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities. We could also be adversely affected if our banks refused to honor their contractual commitments or ceased lending.We are also exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our customers and suppliers. In certain markets, we have experienced a consolidation among those entities to whom we sell. This consolidation has resulted in an increased credit risk spread among fewer customers, often without a corresponding strengthening of their financial status. If the availability of credit to fund or support the continuation and expansion of our customers' business operations is curtailed or if the cost of that credit is increased, the resulting inability of our customers or of their customers to either access credit or absorb the increased cost of that credit could adversely affect our business by reducing our sales or by increasing our exposure to losses from uncollectible customer accounts. The consequences of such adverse effects could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our customers, the reduction, delay or cancellation of customer orders, delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials we purchase, and bankruptcy of customers, suppliers or other creditors. Any of these events may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.The potential impact of our customers' non-compliance with existing commercial contracts and commitments, due to insolvency or for any other reason, may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Most consumers of the metals products we sell have been negatively impacted by the recession and the continued slow recovery therefrom. Due to their economic hardship or the contraction in their operations or due to the fact that the prices for many of the products we sell have declined since the customers entered into the contracts with us, some of our customers have sought to renegotiate or cancel their existing purchase commitments. In addition, some of our customers have breached previously agreed upon contracts to buy our products by refusing delivery of the products. Where appropriate, we have and will in the future pursue litigation to recover our damages resulting from customer contract defaults. We also use credit insurance both in the United States and internationally to mitigate the risk of customer insolvency. However, it is possible that we may not be capable of recovering all of our insured losses if the insurers with whom our accounts receivable are insured experience significant losses threatening their viability. Additionally, credit insurance policies typically have relatively short policy periods and require pre-approval of customers with maximum insured limits established by the customer. If credit insurers incur large losses, the insurance may be more difficult and more costly to secure and may be on less favorable terms.  In addition, a significant amount of our accounts receivable are considered to be open account uninsured accounts receivable. A large number of our customers defaulting on existing contractual obligations to purchase our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.There can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares of our common stock at all or in any particular amounts.On October 28, 2014, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the Company to repurchase up to $100.0 million of shares of our common stock. The stock markets in general have experienced substantial price and trading fluctuations, which 15have resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities that often are unrelated or disproportionate to changes in operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Price volatility over a given period may also cause the average price at which we repurchase our own common stock to exceed the stock's price at a given point in time. In addition, significant changes in the trading price of our common stock and our ability to access capital on terms favorable to us could impact our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock. The timing and amount of any repurchases will be determined by the Company's management based on its evaluation of market conditions, capital allocation alternatives and other factors beyond our control. Our share repurchase program may be modified, suspended, extended or terminated by the Company at any time and without notice. Any failure to repurchase stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact investor confidence in us, thereby negatively impacting our stock price.The agreements governing our notes and our other debt contain financial covenants and impose restrictions on our business. The indenture governing our 6.50% notes due 2017, 7.35% notes due 2018 and 4.875% notes due 2023 contains restrictions on our ability to create liens, sell assets, enter into sale and leaseback transactions and consolidate or merge. In addition to these restrictions, our credit facility contains covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things, enter into transactions with affiliates and guarantee the debt of some of our subsidiaries. Our credit facility also requires that we meet certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios, including a maximum debt to capitalization and interest coverage ratios.Other agreements that we may enter into in the future may contain covenants imposing significant restrictions on our business that are similar to, or in addition to, the covenants under our existing agreements. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. The breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the indenture governing the notes or under our other debt agreements. An event of default under our debt agreements would permit some of our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If we were unable to repay debt to our secured lenders or if we incur secured debt in the future, these lenders could proceed against the collateral securing that debt. In addition, acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on the notes.Increases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. An increase in the value of the U.S. dollar may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, and in particular, the increased strength of the U.S. dollar as compared to China's renminbi or the euro could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. A strong U.S. dollar makes imported metal products less expensive, resulting in more imports of steel products into the United States by our foreign competitors, while a weak U.S. dollar may have the opposite impact on imports. With the exception of exports of nonferrous scrap metal by our Americas Recycling segment, we have not recently been a significant exporter of metal products from our United States operations. Economic difficulties in some large steel-producing regions of the world, resulting in lower local demand for steel products, have historically encouraged greater steel exports to the United States at depressed prices which can be exacerbated by a strong dollar. As a result, our products that are made in the United States may become relatively more expensive as compared to imported steel, which has had and in the future could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.A strong U.S. dollar may also hamper our international marketing and distribution business. Weak local currencies limit the amount of U.S. dollar denominated products that we can import for our international operations and limit our ability to be competitive against local producers selling in local currencies.The U.S. dollar, as with most global currencies, are subject to daily price volatility based on several factors including changes in local government interest rates, macro events and developments, currency manipulation by governments in countries where they buy or sell foreign currencies to strengthen or weaken the local currency or in those instances where local governments fix the pricing of their currencies versus having floating exchange rates. 16Operating internationally carries risks and uncertainties which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our foreign operations generated approximately 22% of our fiscal 2015 net sales. We have significant facilities in Poland and Australia. Our marketing and trading offices are located in most major markets of the world, and our suppliers and customers are located throughout the world. Our marketing and distribution segment relies on substantial international shipments of materials and products in the ordinary course of its business. Our stability, growth and profitability are subject to a number of risks inherent in doing business internationally in addition to the currency exchange risk discussed above, including:•political, military, terrorist or major pandemic events;•local labor and social issues;•legal and regulatory requirements or limitations imposed by foreign governments (particularly those with significant steel consumption or steel related production including China, Brazil, Russia and India), including quotas, tariffs or other protectionist trade barriers, adverse tax law changes, nationalization or currency restrictions; •disruptions or delays in shipments caused by customs compliance or government agencies; and •potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations.These factors may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.We rely on the availability of large amounts of electricity and natural gas for our minimill operations. Disruptions in delivery or substantial increases in energy costs, including crude oil prices, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Minimills melt steel scrap in electric arc furnaces and use natural gas to heat steel billets for rolling into finished products. As large consumers of electricity and gas, often the largest in the geographic area where our minimills are located, we must have dependable delivery of electricity and natural gas in order to operate. Accordingly, we are at risk in the event of an energy disruption. Prolonged black-outs or brown-outs or disruptions caused by natural disasters such as hurricanes would substantially disrupt our production. While we have not suffered prolonged production delays due to our inability to access electricity or natural gas, several of our competitors have experienced such occurrences. Prolonged substantial increases in energy costs would have an adverse effect on the costs of operating our minimills and would negatively impact our gross margins unless we were able to fully pass through the additional expense to our customers. Our finished steel products are typically delivered by truck. Rapid increases in the price of fuel attributable to increases in crude oil prices would increase our costs and adversely affect many of our customers' financial results, which in turn could result in reduced margins and declining demand for our products. Rapid increases in fuel costs may also negatively impact our ability to charter ships for international deliveries at anticipated freight rates, thereby decreasing our margins on those transactions or causing our customers to look for alternative sources.The loss of or inability to hire key employees may adversely affect our ability to successfully manage our operations and meet our strategic objectives. Our future success depends, in large part, on the continued service of our officers and other key employees and our ability to continue to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel. These employees are integral to our success based on their expertise and knowledge of our business and products. We compete for such personnel with other companies, including public and private company competitors who may periodically offer more favorable terms of employment. The loss or interruption of the services of a number of our key employees could reduce our ability to effectively manage our operations due to the fact that we may not be able to find appropriate replacement personnel in a timely manner should the need arise.17We may have difficulty competing with companies that have a lower cost structure or access to greater financial resources. We compete with regional, national and foreign manufacturers and traders. Consolidation among participants in the steel manufacturing and recycling industries has resulted in fewer competitors but several of which are significantly larger than us. Some of our larger competitors have greater financial resources and more diverse businesses than us. Some of our foreign competitors may be able to pursue business opportunities without regard to certain of the laws and regulations with which we must comply, such as environmental regulations. These companies may have a lower cost structure and more operating flexibility, and consequently they may be able to offer better prices and more services than we can. There is no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with these companies. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Information technology interruptions and breaches in data security could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.We rely on computers, information and communications technology and related systems and networks in order to operate our business, including to store sensitive data such as intellectual property, our own proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners and personally identifiable information of our employees. Increased global information technology security requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and a rise in sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems, networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Our systems and networks are also subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, employee error and other similar events. Any of these or other events could result in system interruption, the disclosure, modification or destruction of proprietary and other key information, legal claims or proceedings, production delays or disruptions to operations including processing transactions and reporting financial results and could adversely impact our reputation and our operating results. We have taken steps to address these concerns and have implemented internal control and security measures to protect our systems and networks from security breaches; however, there can be no assurance that a system or network failure, or security breach, will not impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our minimills require continuous capital investments that we may not be able to sustain. We must make regular substantial capital investments in our steel minimills to maintain the minimills, lower production costs and remain competitive. We cannot be certain that we will have sufficient internally generated cash or acceptable external financing to make necessary substantial capital expenditures in the future. The availability of external financing depends on many factors outside of our control, including capital market conditions and the overall performance of the economy. If funding is insufficient, we may be unable to develop or enhance our minimills, take advantage of business opportunities and respond to competitive pressures.Scrap and other supplies for our business are subject to significant price fluctuations and limited availability, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. At any given time, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of critical raw materials with a price and other terms acceptable to us. We depend on ferrous scrap, the primary feedstock for our steel minimills, and other supplies such as graphite electrodes and ferroalloys for our steel minimill operations. The price of scrap and other supplies has historically been subject to significant fluctuation, and we may not be able to adjust our product prices to recover the costs of rapid increases in material prices, especially over the short-term and in our domestic fabrication segment's fixed price contracts. The profitability of our steel minimill operations and domestic fabrication segments would be adversely affected if we are unable to pass on to our customers increased raw material and supply costs. Changing process could potentially impact the volume of scrap metal available to us and the volume and realized margins of processed metal we sell. The purchase prices for automobile bodies and various other grades of obsolete and industrial scrap, as well as the selling prices for processed and recycled scrap metals we utilize in our own manufacturing process or we resell to others, are highly volatile. A prolonged period of low scrap prices or a fall in scrap prices could reduce our ability to obtain, process and sell recycled material, which could have a material adverse effect on our metals recycling operations business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices may be limited by competitive or other factors during periods of low scrap prices, when the supply of scrap may decline considerably, as scrap generators hold onto their scrap in the hope of getting higher prices later; conversely, increased foreign demand for scrap due to economic expansion in countries such as China, India, Brazil and Turkey can result in an outflow of available domestic scrap as well as higher scrap prices that cannot always be passed on to domestic scrap consumers, further reducing the available domestic scrap flows and scrap margins all of which could adversely affect our sales and profitability.  18Our Arkansas mill does not have melting capacity, so it is dependent on an adequate supply of competitively priced used rail. The availability of used rail fluctuates with the pace of railroad abandonments, rail replacement by railroads in the United States and abroad and demand for used rail from other domestic and foreign rail rerolling mills. Price increases for used rail could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.The availability and process of raw materials may also be negatively affected by new laws and regulations, allocations by suppliers, interruptions in production, accidents or natural disasters, changes in exchange rates, worldwide price fluctuations, and the availability and cost of transportation. If we were unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of our required raw materials, we may be unable to timely manufacture significant quantities of our products. Unexpected equipment failures may lead to production curtailments or shutdowns, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Interruptions in our production capabilities would adversely affect our production costs, steel available for sale and earnings for the affected period. Our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of steel-making equipment, such as our furnaces, continuous casters and rolling equipment, as well as electrical equipment, such as transformers. This equipment may, on occasion, be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, material plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such equipment failures. In addition to equipment failures, our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, explosions or violent weather conditions.Competition from other materials may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In many applications, steel competes with other materials, such as aluminum and plastics (particularly in the automobile industry), cement, composites, glass and wood. Increased use of or additional substitutes for steel products could adversely affect future market prices and demand for steel products.Hedging transactions may expose us to losses or limit our potential gains. Our product lines and worldwide operations expose us to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. As part of our risk management program, we use financial instruments, including metals commodity futures, natural gas forward contracts, freight forward contracts, foreign currency exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts. While intended to reduce the effects of the fluctuations, these transactions may limit our potential gains or expose us to losses. If our counterparties to such transactions or the sponsors of the exchanges through which these transactions are offered, such as the London Metal Exchange, fail to honor their obligations due to financial distress, we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipated gains from these transactions.We enter into the foreign currency exchange forward contracts as economic hedges of trade commitments or anticipated commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency to mitigate the effects of changes in currency rates. These foreign exchange commitments are dependent on timely performance by our counterparties. Their failure to perform could result in our having to close these hedges without the anticipated underlying transaction and could result in losses if foreign currency exchange rates have changed.19We are subject to litigation and legal compliance risks which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are involved in various litigation matters, including regulatory proceedings, administrative proceedings, governmental investigations, environmental matters and construction contract disputes. The nature of our operations also exposes us to possible litigation claims in the future. Because of the uncertain nature of litigation and coverage decisions, we cannot predict the outcome of these matters. These matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Litigation is very costly, and the costs associated with prosecuting and defending litigation matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure to loss in connection with litigation matters, we make accruals as warranted. However, the amounts that we accrue could vary significantly from the amounts we actually pay, due to inherent uncertainties and the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process, the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors. See Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, for a description of our current significant legal proceedings.As noted above, existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, and future laws and regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See “Compliance with and changes in environmental compliance requirements and remediation requirements could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs; violations of environmental requirements could result in costs that have a material adverse effect on our financial condition” above for a description of such risks relating to environmental laws and regulations. In addition to such environmental laws and regulations, complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, including without limitation the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws in other countries, which generally prohibit companies and those acting on their behalf from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, regulations related to import-export controls, the Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions program and antiboycott provisions, may increase our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and expose us and our employees to elevated risk. While we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs, the nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist. A negative outcome in an unusual or significant legal proceeding or compliance investigation could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Some of our operations present significant risk of injury or death. The industrial activities conducted at our facilities present significant risk of serious injury or death to our employees, customers or other visitors to our operations, notwithstanding our safety precautions, including our material compliance with Federal, state and local employee health and safety regulations, and we may be unable to avoid material liabilities for injuries or deaths. We maintain workers' compensation insurance to address the risk of incurring material liabilities for injuries or deaths, but there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage will be adequate or will continue to be available on the terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could result in material liabilities to us for any injuries or deaths.Health care legislation could result in substantially increased costs and adversely affect our workforce. Recently enacted health care mandates may cause us to evaluate the scope of health benefits offered to our workforce and the method in which they are delivered, and increase our and our employees' costs. If we are not able to offer a competitive level of benefits, our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel may be adversely affected. Higher health care costs may result in (i) an inability to reinvest sufficient capital in our operations, (ii) an inability to sustain dividends, (iii) lowered debt ratings and (iv) an increase in the cost of capital, all of which may have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition"
10,CMC,COMMERCIAL METALS,2014-10-30,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSThere are inherent risks and uncertainties associated with our business that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Set forth below are descriptions of those risks and uncertainties that we currently believe to be material, but the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRYOur industry is vulnerable to global economic conditions, including the slow recovery from the recent recession and the risk of a recession relapse. Our financial results are substantially dependent upon the overall economic conditions in the United States and the European Union. The continuing economic downturn following the deep global recession that began in the United States in December 2007 and officially ended in June 2009 has continued to have an adverse effect on the demand for our products and, consequently, our business, results of operations and financial condition. Prolongation of the recovery from the recession could stifle improving customer confidence and adversely affect demand for our products and further adversely affect our business. In addition, uncertainties in Europe regarding the financial sector and sovereign debt and the potential impact on banks in other regions of the world have continued to weigh on global and domestic growth. Metals industries have historically been vulnerable to significant declines in consumption and product pricing during prolonged periods of economic downturn. Likewise the pace of construction has historically slowed significantly during economic downturns. Our geographic concentration in the southern and southwestern United States as well as Central Europe, Australia, China, and the Middle East exposes us to the local market conditions in these regions. Economic downturns in these areas or decisions by governments that have an impact on the level and pace of overall economic activity in a particular region could also adversely affect demand for our products and, consequently, our sales and profitability. The recovery in this industry could be prolonged further than other sectors of the U.S. economy.Although we believe that the long-term prospects for the steel industry remain bright, we are unable to predict the duration of the depressed economic conditions that are contributing to reduced demand for our products. Future economic downturns or a prolonged period of slow growth or economic stagnation could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our industry is cyclical, and prolonged periods of slow economic growth could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our business supports cyclical industries such as commercial, residential and government construction, energy, metals service center, petrochemical and original equipment manufacturing. We may experience significant fluctuations in demand for our products from these industries based on economic conditions, energy prices, consumer demand and decisions by governments to fund infrastructure projects such as highways, schools, energy plants and airports. As a result of the volatility in the industries we serve, we may have difficulty increasing or maintaining our level of sales or profitability. Our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected if the industries we serve suffer a prolonged downturn or anemic growth. Although the residential housing market is not a significant direct factor in our business, related commercial and infrastructure construction activities, such as shopping centers, schools and roads, could be adversely impacted by a prolonged slump in new housing construction.Our industry is characterized by low backlogs, which means that our business, results of operations and financial condition are promptly affected by short-term economic fluctuations.The scrap metal recycling industry has historically been, and is expected to remain, highly cyclical. A prolonged period of low scrap prices or a fall in scrap metal prices could result in the weakening of scrap flows and thereby reduce our ability to obtain, process and sell recycled material, and this could have a material adverse effect on our metals recycling operations' business, results of operations and financial condition. The purchase prices for automobile bodies and various other grades of obsolete and industrial scrap, as well as the selling prices for processed and recycled scrap metals we utilize in our own manufacturing process or we resell to others through our metals recycling operations, are highly volatile. As a metals recycler, we may attempt to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices by adjusting the scrap metal purchase prices we pay to others, but our ability to do this may be limited by competitive or other factors during periods of low scrap prices, when the supply of scrap may decline considerably, as scrap generators hold onto their scrap in the hope of getting higher prices later; conversely, increased foreign demand for scrap due to economic expansion in 12countries such as China, India, Brazil, and Turkey can result in an outflow of available domestic scrap as well as higher scrap prices that cannot always be passed on to domestic scrap consumers, further reducing the available domestic scrap flows and scrap margins all of which could adversely affect our sales and profitability.A significant reduction in China's steel consumption or increased Chinese steel production substantially exceeding local demand may result in China becoming a large exporter of steel and disruption to world steel markets. Chinese economic expansion has affected the availability and heightened the volatility of many commodities that we market and use in our manufacturing process, including steel. Expansions and contractions in China's economy can have major effects on the price of our finished steel products and many commodities that affect us such as secondary metals, energy, marine freight rates, steel making supplies such as ferroalloys and graphite electrodes, and materials we market, such as iron ore and coke. If Chinese demand weakens or Chinese steel production expands to the point that it significantly exceeds the country's consumption, prices for many of the products that we both sell to and export from China may fall, causing erosion in our gross margins and subjecting us to possible renegotiation of contracts or increases in bad debts. Significant exports from China of steel in the product lines we manufacture would likely cause our selling prices to decline and negatively impact our volumes and gross margins.Rapid and significant changes in the price of metals could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Prices for most metals in which we deal have experienced increased volatility over the last several years, and such increased price volatility impacts us in several ways. Some of our operations, such as our fabrication operations, may benefit from rapidly decreasing steel prices as their material cost for previously contracted fixed price work declines. Others, such as our Americas Mills and International Mill segments, would likely experience reduced margins and may be forced to liquidate high cost inventory at reduced margins or losses until prices stabilize. Sudden increases could have the opposite effect. Overall, we believe that rapid substantial price changes are not to our industry's benefit. Our customer and supplier base would be impacted due to uncertainty as to future prices. A reluctance to purchase inventory in the face of extreme price decreases or to sell quickly during a period of rapid price increases would likely reduce our volume of business. Marginal industry participants or speculators may attempt to participate to an unhealthy extent during a period of rapid price escalation with a substantial risk of contract default if prices suddenly reverse. Risks of default in contract performance by customers or suppliers as well as an increased risk of bad debts and customer credit exposure could increase during periods of rapid and substantial price changes.Excess capacity in our industry could increase the level of steel imports into the United States, resulting in lower domestic prices which would adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability. Steel-making capacity exceeds demand for steel products in some countries. Rather than reducing employment by rationalizing capacity with consumption, steel manufacturers in these countries (often with local government assistance or subsidies in various forms) have traditionally periodically exported steel at prices significantly below their home market prices and which may not reflect their costs of production or capital. This supply of imports can decrease the sensitivity of domestic steel prices to increases in demand or decrease our ability to recover our manufacturing costs. The excess capacity may create downward pressure on our steel prices which would adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability.Compliance with and changes in environmental compliance requirements and remediation requirements could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs; violations of environmental requirements could result in costs that have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, and future laws and regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is a significant factor in our business. We are subject to local, state, Federal and international environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other matters, waste disposal, air emissions, waste and storm water effluent and disposal and employee health. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may seek injunctive relief impacting continuing operations for non-compliance with environmental requirements.  New facilities that we may build, especially steel minimills, are required to obtain several environmental permits before significant construction or commencement of operations. Delays in obtaining permits or unanticipated conditions in such permits could delay the project or increase construction costs or operating expenses. Our manufacturing and recycling operations produce significant amounts of by-products, some of which are handled as industrial waste or hazardous waste. For example, our minimills generate electric arc furnace dust (""EAF dust""), which the Environmental Protection Agency (the ""EPA"") and other regulatory authorities classify as hazardous waste. EAF dust and other industrial waste and hazardous waste require special handling, recycling or disposal.13In addition, the primary feed materials for the shredders operated by our scrap metal recycling facilities are automobile hulks and obsolete household appliances. Approximately 20% of the weight of an automobile hull consists of unrecyclable material known as shredder fluff. After the segregation of ferrous and saleable nonferrous metals, shredder fluff remains. We, along with others in the recycling industry, interpret Federal regulations to require shredder fluff to meet certain criteria and pass a toxic leaching test to avoid classification as a hazardous waste. We also endeavor to remove hazardous contaminants from the feed material prior to shredding. As a result, we believe the shredder fluff we generate is not normally considered or properly classified as hazardous waste. If the laws, regulations or testing methods change with regard to EAF dust or shredder fluff or other by-products, we may incur additional significant costs.Changes to National Ambient Air Quality Standards (""NAAQS"") or other requirements on our air emissions could make it more difficult to obtain new permits or to modify existing permits, and could require changes to our operations or emissions control equipment. Such difficulties and changes could result in operational delays and capital and on-going compliance expenditures.Legal requirements are changing frequently and are subject to interpretation. New laws, regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities, together with uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels, testing and sampling procedures, new pollution control technology and cost/benefit analysis based on market conditions are all factors that may increase our future expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. Accordingly, we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of future compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. We cannot predict whether such costs would be able to be passed on to customers through product price increases. Competitors in various regions or countries where environmental regulation is less restrictive, subject to different interpretation or generally not enforced, may enjoy a competitive advantage.We may also be required to conduct additional clean up (and pay for associated natural resource damages) at sites where we have already participated in remediation efforts or to take remediation action with regard to sites formerly used in connection with our operations. We may be required to pay for a portion or all of the costs of clean up or remediation at sites we never owned or on which we never operated if we are found to have arranged for treatment or disposal of hazardous substances on the sites. In cases of joint and several liability, we may be obligated to pay a disproportionate share of cleanup costs if other responsible parties are financially insolvent.Increased regulation associated with climate change and greenhouse gas emissions could impose significant additional costs on both our steelmaking and metals recycling operations. The U.S. government and various governmental agencies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impact of climate change. International treaties or agreements may also result in increasing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, including the introduction of carbon emissions trading mechanisms. Any such regulation regarding climate change and greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions could impose significant costs on our steelmaking and metals recycling operations and on the operations of our customers and suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs in order to comply with current or future laws or regulations concerning and limitations imposed on our operations by virtue of climate change and GHG emissions laws and regulations. The potential costs of ""allowances,"" ""offsets"" or ""credits"" that may be part of potential cap-and-trade programs or similar future regulatory measures are still uncertain. Any adopted future climate change and GHG regulations could negatively impact our ability (and that of our customers and suppliers) to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. From a medium and long-term perspective, as a result of these regulatory initiatives, we may see an increase in costs relating to our assets that emit significant amounts of greenhouse gases. These regulatory initiatives will be either voluntary or mandatory and may impact our operations directly or through our suppliers or customers. Until the timing, scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known, we cannot predict the effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, but such effect could be materially adverse to our business, financial condition, and results of operations.RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMPANYPotential limitations on our ability to access credit may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We could be adversely affected if our banks refused to honor their contractual commitments or ceased lending. Our senior unsecured debt is rated by Standard & Poor's Corporation (BB+) and Moody's Investors Service (Ba2). In determining our credit ratings, the rating agencies consider a number of both quantitative and qualitative factors. These factors include earnings (loss), fixed charges such as interest, cash flows, total debt outstanding, off-balance sheet obligations and other commitments, total capitalization and various ratios calculated from these factors. The rating agencies also consider predictability of cash flows, business strategy and diversity, industry conditions and contingencies. 14There can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares of our common stock at all or in any particular amounts.On October 28, 2014, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the Company to repurchase up to $100.0 million of shares of our common stock. The stock markets in general have experienced substantial price and trading fluctuations, which have resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities that often are unrelated or disproportionate to changes in operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Price volatility over a given period may also cause the average price at which we repurchase our own common stock to exceed the stock's price at a given point in time. In addition, significant changes in the trading price of our common stock and our ability to access capital on terms favorable to us could impact our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock. The timing and amount of any repurchases will be determined by the Company's management based on its evaluation of market conditions, capital allocation alternatives and other factors beyond our control. Our share repurchase program may be modified, suspended, extended or terminated by the Company at any time and without notice. Any failure to repurchase stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact investor confidence in us, thereby negatively impacting our stock price.Our customers' inability to obtain credit may result in their default on the debts they owe to us. If the recent constraints on access to credit continue for a prolonged period, some of our customers may struggle or fail to meet their obligations to pay us, especially if they in turn experience defaults on receivables due from their customers. A continued economic downturn could result in our incurring bad debt costs in excess of our expectations and prior experience. In certain markets, we have experienced a consolidation among those entities to whom we sell. This consolidation, along with higher metals and other commodity prices, has resulted in an increased credit risk spread among fewer customers, often without a corresponding strengthening of their financial status. We use credit insurance both in the United States and internationally to mitigate the risk of customer insolvency. However, it is possible that we may not be capable of recovering all of our insured losses if the insurers with whom our accounts receivable are insured experience significant losses threatening their viability. Additionally, credit insurance policies typically have relatively short policy periods and require pre-approval of customers with maximum insured limits established by the customer. If credit insurers incur large losses, the insurance may be more difficult and more costly to secure and may be on less favorable terms. While in many international sales transactions we require letters of credit from financial institutions, which we believe to be financially secure, we may be at risk in the event the financial institution subsequently fails and the customer is unable to pay for the products we sold. A significant amount of our accounts receivable are considered to be open account uninsured accounts receivable. We regularly maintain a substantial amount of accounts receivable ($1,028.4 million at August 31, 2014). Potential impact of our customers' non-compliance with existing commercial contracts and commitments. Most consumers of the metals products we sell have been negatively impacted by the recession and the continued slow recovery therefrom. Due to their economic hardship or the contraction in their operations or due to the fact that the prices for many of the products we sell have declined since the customers entered into the contracts with us, some of our customers have sought to renegotiate or cancel their existing purchase commitments. In addition, some of our customers have breached previously agreed upon contracts to buy our products by refusing delivery of the products. Where appropriate, we have and will in the future pursue litigation to recover our damages resulting from customer contract defaults. A large number of our customers defaulting on existing contractual obligations to purchase our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.The agreements governing our notes and our other debt contain financial covenants and impose restrictions on our business. The indenture governing our 6.50% notes due 2017, 7.35% notes due 2018 and 4.875% notes due 2023 contains restrictions on our ability to create liens, sell assets, enter into sale and leaseback transactions and consolidate or merge. In addition to these restrictions, our credit facility contains covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things, enter into transactions with affiliates and guarantee the debt of some of our subsidiaries. Our credit facility also requires that we meet certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios, including a maximum debt to capitalization and interest coverage ratios.Other agreements that we may enter into in the future may contain covenants imposing significant restrictions on our business that are similar to, or in addition to, the covenants under our existing agreements. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. The breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the indenture governing the notes or under our other debt agreements. An event of default under our debt agreements would permit some of our lenders to declare all 15amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If we were unable to repay debt to our secured lenders or if we incur secured debt in the future, these lenders could proceed against the collateral securing that debt. In addition, acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on the notes.Increases in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to other currencies may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. An increase in the value of the U.S. dollar may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, and in particular, the increased strength of the U.S. dollar as compared to China's renminbi or the euro dollar could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. A strong U.S. dollar makes imported metal products less expensive, resulting in more imports of steel products into the United States by our foreign competitors, while a weak U.S. dollar may have the opposite impact on imports. With the exception of exports of nonferrous scrap metal by our Americas Recycling segment, we have not recently been a significant exporter of metal products from our United States operations. Economic difficulties in some large steel producing regions of the world, resulting in lower local demand for steel products, have historically encouraged greater steel exports to the United States at depressed prices which can be exacerbated by a strong dollar. As a result, our products that are made in the United States may become relatively more expensive as compared to imported steel, which has had and in the future could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.A strong U.S. dollar may also hamper our international marketing and distribution business. Weak local currencies limit the amount of U.S. dollar denominated products that we can import for our international operations and limit our ability to be competitive against local producers selling in local currencies.Operating internationally carries risks and uncertainties which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our foreign operations generated approximately 28% of our 2014 revenue. We have significant facilities in Poland and Australia. Our marketing and trading offices are located in most major markets of the world, and our suppliers and customers are located throughout the world. Our marketing and distribution segment relies on substantial international shipments of materials and products in the ordinary course of its business. Our stability, growth and profitability are subject to a number of risks inherent in doing business internationally in addition to the currency exchange risk discussed above, including:•political, military, terrorist or major pandemic events;•legal and regulatory requirements or limitations imposed by foreign governments (particularly those with significant steel consumption or steel related production including China, Brazil, Russia and India) including quotas, tariffs or other protectionist trade barriers, adverse tax law changes, nationalization or currency restrictions; •disruptions or delays in shipments caused by customs compliance or government agencies; and •potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations.These factors may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.We rely on the availability of large amounts of electricity and natural gas for our minimill operations. Disruptions in delivery or substantial increases in energy costs, including crude oil prices, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Minimills melt steel scrap in electric arc furnaces and use natural gas to heat steel billets for rolling into finished products. As large consumers of electricity and gas, often the largest in the geographic area where our minimills are located, we must have dependable delivery of electricity and natural gas in order to operate. Accordingly, we are at risk in the event of an energy disruption. Prolonged black-outs or brown-outs or disruptions caused by natural disasters such as hurricanes would substantially disrupt our production. While we have not suffered prolonged production delays due to our inability to access electricity or natural gas, several of our competitors have experienced such occurrences. Prolonged substantial increases in energy costs would have an adverse effect on the costs of operating our minimills and would negatively impact our gross margins unless we were able to fully pass through the additional expense to our customers. Our finished steel products are typically delivered by truck. Rapid increases in the price of fuel attributable to increases in crude oil prices would increase our costs and adversely affect many of our customers' financial results, which in turn could result in reduced margins and declining demand for our products. Rapid increases in fuel costs may also negatively impact our ability to charter ships for international deliveries at anticipated freight rates, thereby decreasing our margins on those transactions or causing our customers to look for alternative sources.16If we lose the services of key employees we may not be able to successfully manage our operations and meet our strategic objectives. Our future success depends, in large part, on the continued service of our officers and other key employees and our ability to continue to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel. These employees are integral to our success based on their expertise and knowledge of our business and products. We compete for such personnel with other companies, including public and private company competitors who may periodically offer more favorable terms of employment. The loss or interruption of the services of a number of our key employees could reduce our ability to effectively manage our operations due to the fact that we may not be able to find appropriate replacement personnel in a timely manner should the need arise.We may have difficulty competing with companies that have a lower cost structure or access to greater financial resources. We compete with regional, national and foreign manufacturers and traders. Consolidation among participants in the steel manufacturing and recycling industries has resulted in fewer competitors but several which are significantly larger than us. Some of our larger competitors have greater financial resources and more diverse businesses than us. Some of our foreign competitors may be able to pursue business opportunities without regard to certain of the laws and regulations with which we must comply, such as environmental regulations. These companies may have a lower cost structure, more operating flexibility and consequently they may be able to offer better prices and more services than we can. There is no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with these companies. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Information technology interruptions and breaches in data security could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.We rely on computers, information and communications technology and related systems and networks in order to operate our business, including to store sensitive data such as intellectual property, our own proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners and personally identifiable information of our employees. Increased global information technology security requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and a rise in sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems, networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Our systems and networks are also subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, employee error and other similar events. Any of these or other events could result in system interruption, the disclosure, modification or destruction of proprietary and other key information, legal claims or proceedings, production delays or disruptions to operations including processing transactions and reporting financial results and could adversely impact our reputation and our operating results. We have taken steps to address these concerns and have implemented internal control and security measures to protect our systems and networks from security breaches; however, there can be no assurance that a system or network failure, or security breach, will not impact our financial condition and operating results.Our minimills require continuous capital investments that we may not be able to sustain. We must make regular substantial capital investments in our steel minimills to maintain the minimills, lower production costs and remain competitive. We cannot be certain that we will have sufficient internally generated cash or acceptable external financing to make necessary substantial capital expenditures in the future. The availability of external financing depends on many factors outside of our control, including capital market conditions and the overall performance of the economy. If funding is insufficient, we may be unable to develop or enhance our minimills, take advantage of business opportunities and respond to competitive pressures.Scrap and other supplies for our businesses are subject to significant price fluctuations, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We depend on ferrous scrap, the primary feedstock for our steel minimills, and other supplies such as graphite electrodes and ferroalloys for our steel minimill operations. The price of scrap and other supplies has historically been subject to significant fluctuation, and we may not be able to adjust our product prices to recover the costs of rapid increases in material prices, especially over the short-term and in our domestic fabrication segment's fixed price contracts. Our profitability would be adversely affected if we are unable to pass on to our customers increased raw material and supply costs.Our Arkansas mill does not have melting capacity, so it is dependent on an adequate supply of competitively priced used rail. The availability of used rail fluctuates with the pace of railroad abandonments, rail replacement by railroads in the United States and abroad and demand for used rail from other domestic and foreign rail rerolling mills. Price increases for used rail could adversely 17affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Unexpected equipment failures may lead to production curtailments or shutdowns. Interruptions in our production capabilities would adversely affect our production costs, steel available for sale and earnings for the affected period. Our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of steel-making equipment, such as our furnaces, continuous casters and rolling equipment, as well as electrical equipment, such as transformers. This equipment may, on occasion, be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, material plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such equipment failures. In addition to equipment failures, our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, explosions or violent weather conditions.Competition from other materials may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In many applications, steel competes with other materials, such as aluminum and plastics (particularly in the automobile industry), cement, composites, glass and wood. Increased use of or additional substitutes for steel products could adversely affect future market prices and demand for steel products.Hedging transactions may expose us to losses or limit our potential gains. Our product lines and worldwide operations expose us to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. As part of our risk management program, we use financial instruments, including metals commodity futures, natural gas forward contracts, freight forward contracts, foreign currency exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts. While intended to reduce the effects of the fluctuations, these transactions may limit our potential gains or expose us to losses. If our counterparties to such transactions or the sponsors of the exchanges through which these transactions are offered, such as the London Metal Exchange, fail to honor their obligations due to financial distress, we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipated gains from these transactions.We enter into the foreign currency exchange forward contracts as economic hedges of trade commitments or anticipated commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency to mitigate the effects of changes in currency rates. These foreign exchange commitments are dependent on timely performance by our counterparties. Their failure to perform could result in our having to close these hedges without the anticipated underlying transaction and could result in losses if foreign currency exchange rates have changed.We are involved and may in the future become involved in various environmental matters that may result in fines, penalties or judgments being assessed against us or liability imposed upon us which we cannot presently estimate or reasonably foresee and which may have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ""(CERCLA""),  or Superfund, or similar state statutes, we may have obligations to conduct investigation and remediation activities associated with alleged releases of hazardous substances or to reimburse the EPA (or state agencies as applicable) for such activities and to pay for natural resource damages associated with alleged releases. We have been named a potentially responsible party (""PRP"") at several Federal and state Superfund sites because the EPA or an equivalent state agency contends that we and other potentially responsible scrap metal suppliers are liable for the cleanup of those sites as a result of having sold scrap metal to unrelated manufacturers for recycling as a raw material in the manufacture of new products. We are involved in litigation or administrative proceedings with regard to several of these sites in which we are contesting, or at the appropriate time may contest, our liability. In addition, we have received information requests with regard to other sites which may be under consideration by the EPA as potential CERCLA sites.We are presently participating in PRP organizations at several sites, which are paying for certain remediation expenses. Although we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure to loss in connection with various environmental matters or the effect on our consolidated financial position, we make accruals as warranted. In addition, although we do not believe that a reasonably possible range of loss in excess of amounts accrued for pending lawsuits, claims or proceedings would be material to our financial statements, additional developments may occur, and due to inherent uncertainties, including evolving remediation technology, changing regulations, possible third-party contributions, the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process, the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors, the amounts we ultimately are required to pay could vary significantly from the amounts we accrue, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.18We are subject to litigation which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are involved in various litigation matters, including regulatory proceedings, administrative proceedings, governmental investigations, environmental matters and construction contract disputes. The nature of our operations also exposes us to possible litigation claims in the future. Because of the uncertain nature of litigation and coverage decisions, we cannot predict the outcome of these matters. These matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Litigation is very costly, and the costs associated with prosecuting and defending litigation matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure to loss in connection with litigation matters, we make accruals as warranted. However, the amounts that we accrue could vary significantly from the amounts we actually pay, due to inherent uncertainties and the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process, the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors.Some of our operations present significant risk of injury or death. The industrial activities conducted at our facilities present significant risk of serious injury or death to our employees, customers or other visitors to our operations, notwithstanding our safety precautions, including our material compliance with Federal, state and local employee health and safety regulations, and we may be unable to avoid material liabilities for injuries or deaths. We maintain workers' compensation insurance to address the risk of incurring material liabilities for injuries or deaths, but there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage will be adequate or will continue to be available on the terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could result in material liabilities to us for any injuries or deaths.Health care legislation could result in substantially increased costs and adversely affect our workforce. Recently enacted health care mandates may cause us to evaluate the scope of health benefits offered to our workforce and the method in which they are delivered, and increase our and our employees' costs. If we are not able to offer a competitive level of benefits, our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel may be adversely affected. Higher health care costs may result in (i) an inability to reinvest sufficient capital in our operations, (ii) an inability to sustain dividends, (iii) lowered debt ratings and (iv) an increase in the cost of capital, all of which may have a negative effect on the price of our common stock"
13,CMC,COMMERCIAL METALS,2013-10-28,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSThere are inherent risks and uncertainties associated with our business that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Set forth below are descriptions of those risks and uncertainties that we currently believe to be material, but the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRYOUR INDUSTRY IS VULNERABLE TO GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE SLOW RECOVERY FROM THE RECENT RECESSION AND THE RISK OF A RECESSION RELAPSE.Our financial results are substantially dependent upon the overall economic conditions in the United States and the European Union.  The sluggish pace of recovery from the deep global recession that began in the United States in December 2007 and officially ended in June 2009 has continued to have an adverse effect on the demand for our products and, consequently, our business, results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, uncertainties in Europe regarding the financial sector and sovereign debt and the potential impact on banks in other regions of the world have continued to weigh on global and domestic growth.  Metals industries have historically been vulnerable to significant declines in consumption and product pricing during prolonged periods of economic downturn.  Likewise the pace of construction has historically slowed significantly during economic downturns.  Our geographic concentration in the southern and southwestern United States as well as Central Europe, Australia, China, and the Middle East exposes us to the local market conditions in these regions.  Economic downturns in these areas or decisions by governments that have an impact on the level and pace of overall economic activity in a particular region could also adversely affect demand for our products and, consequently, our sales and profitability.Although we believe that the long-term prospects for the steel industry remain bright, we are unable to predict the duration of the depressed economic conditions that are contributing to reduced demand for our products.  Future economic downturns or a prolonged period of slow growth or economic stagnation could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.OUR INDUSTRY IS CYCLICAL, AND PROLONGED PERIODS OF SLOW ECONOMIC GROWTH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.Our business supports cyclical industries such as commercial, residential and government construction, energy, metals service center, petrochemical and original equipment manufacturing.  We may experience significant fluctuations in demand for our products from these industries based on economic conditions, energy prices, consumer demand and decisions by governments to fund infrastructure projects such as highways, schools, energy plants and airports.  As a result of the volatility in the industries we serve, we may have difficulty increasing or maintaining our level of sales or profitability.  Our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected if the industries we serve suffer a prolonged downturn or anemic growth.  Although the residential housing market is not a significant direct factor in our business, related commercial and infrastructure construction activities, such as shopping centers, schools and roads, could be adversely impacted by a prolonged slump in new housing construction.Our industry is characterized by low backlogs, which means that our business, results of operations and financial condition are promptly affected by short-term economic fluctuations.THE SCRAP METAL RECYCLING INDUSTRY HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN, AND IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN, HIGHLY CYCLICAL. A PROLONGED PERIOD OF LOW SCRAP PRICES OR A FALL IN SCRAP METAL PRICES, COULD RESULT IN THE WEAKENING OF SCRAP FLOWS AND THEREBY REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN, PROCESS AND SELL RECYCLED MATERIALS, AND THIS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR METALS RECYCLING OPERATIONS'  BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. The purchase prices for automobile bodies and various other grades of obsolete and industrial scrap, as well as the selling prices for processed and recycled scrap metals we utilize in our own manufacturing process or we resell to others through our metals recycling operations, are highly volatile.  As a metals recycler, we may attempt to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices by adjusting the scrap metal purchase prices we pay to others, but our ability to do this may be limited by competitive or other factors during periods of low scrap prices, when the supply of scrap may decline considerably, as scrap generators hold onto their scrap in the hope of getting higher prices later; conversely, increased foreign demand for scrap due to economic expansion in countries such as China, India, Brazil, and Turkey can result in an outflow of available domestic scrap as well as higher scrap prices that cannot always be passed on to domestic scrap consumers, further reducing the available domestic scrap flows and scrap margins all of which could adversely affect our sales and profitability.A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN CHINA'S STEEL CONSUMPTION OR INCREASED CHINESE STEEL PRODUCTION SUBSTANTIALLY EXCEEDING LOCAL DEMAND MAY RESULT IN CHINA BECOMING A LARGE EXPORTER OF STEEL AND DISRUPTION TO WORLD STEEL MARKETS.Chinese economic expansion has affected the availability and heightened the volatility of many commodities that we market and use in our manufacturing process, including steel. Expansions and contractions in China's economy can have major effects on the price of our finished steel products and many commodities that affect us such as secondary metals, energy, marine freight rates, steel making supplies such as ferroalloys and graphite electrodes, and materials we market, such as iron ore and coke.  If Chinese demand weakens or Chinese steel production expands to the point that it significantly exceeds the country's consumption, prices for many of the products that we both sell to and export from China may fall, causing erosion in our gross margins and subjecting us to possible renegotiation of contracts or increases in bad debts.  Significant exports from China of steel in the product lines we manufacture would likely cause our selling prices to decline and negatively impact our volumes and gross margins.RAPID AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF METALS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.Prices for most metals in which we deal have experienced increased volatility over the last several years, and such increased price volatility impacts us in several ways.  Some of our operations, such as our fabrication operations, may benefit from rapidly decreasing steel prices as their material cost for previously contracted fixed price work declines.  Others, such as our Americas Mills and International Mill segments, would likely experience reduced margins and may be forced to liquidate high cost inventory at reduced margins or losses until prices stabilize.  Sudden increases could have the opposite effect.  Overall, we believe that rapid substantial price changes are not to our industry's benefit.  Our customer and supplier base would be impacted due to uncertainty as to future prices.  A reluctance to purchase inventory in the face of extreme price decreases or to sell quickly during a period of rapid price increases would likely reduce our volume of business. Marginal industry participants or speculators may attempt to participate to an unhealthy extent during a period of rapid price escalation with a substantial risk of contract default if prices suddenly reverse.  Risks of default in contract performance by customers or suppliers as well as an increased risk of bad debts and customer credit exposure could increase during periods of rapid and substantial price changes.EXCESS CAPACITY IN OUR INDUSTRY COULD INCREASE THE LEVEL OF STEEL IMPORTS INTO THE UNITED STATES, RESULTING IN LOWER DOMESTIC PRICES WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SALES, MARGINS AND PROFITABILITY.Steel-making capacity exceeds demand for steel products in some countries.  Rather than reducing employment by rationalizing capacity with consumption, steel manufacturers in these countries (often with local government assistance or subsidies in various forms) have traditionally periodically exported steel at prices significantly below their home market prices and which may not reflect their costs of production or capital.  This supply of imports can decrease the sensitivity of domestic steel prices to increases in demand or decrease our ability to recover our manufacturing costs.  The excess capacity may create downward pressure on our steel prices which would adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability.COMPLIANCE WITH AND CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND REMEDIATION REQUIREMENTS COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OPERATING COSTS.Existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, and future laws and regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is a significant factor in our business.  We are subject to local, state, Federal and international environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other matters, waste disposal, air emissions, waste and storm water effluent and disposal and employee health.  New facilities that we may build, especially steel minimills, are required to obtain several environmental permits before significant construction or commencement of operations.  Delays in obtaining permits or unanticipated conditions in such permits could delay the project or increase construction costs or operating expenses. Our manufacturing and recycling operations produce significant amounts of by-products, some of which are handled as industrial waste or hazardous waste. For example, our minimills generate electric arc furnace dust (""EAF dust""), which the Environmental Protection Agency (the ""EPA"") and other regulatory authorities classify as hazardous waste. EAF dust and other industrial waste and hazardous waste require special handling, recycling or disposal.In addition, the primary feed materials for the shredders operated by our scrap metal recycling facilities are automobile hulks and obsolete household appliances. Approximately 20% of the weight of an automobile hull consists of unrecyclable material known as shredder fluff.  After the segregation of ferrous and saleable nonferrous metals, shredder fluff remains.  We, along with others in the recycling industry, interpret Federal regulations to require shredder fluff to meet certain criteria and pass a toxic leaching test to avoid classification as a hazardous waste.  We also endeavor to remove hazardous contaminants from the feed material prior to shredding.  As a result, we believe the shredder fluff we generate is not normally considered or properly classified as hazardous waste.  If the laws, regulations or testing methods change with regard to EAF dust or shredder fluff or other by-products, we may incur additional significant costs.Legal requirements are changing frequently and are subject to interpretation.  New laws, regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities, together with uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels, testing and sampling procedures, new pollution control technology and cost/benefit analysis based on market conditions are all factors that may increase our future expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. Accordingly, we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of future compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. We cannot predict whether such costs would be able to be passed on to customers through product price increases.  Competitors in various regions or countries where environmental regulation is less restrictive, subject to different interpretation or generally not enforced, may enjoy a competitive advantage.We may also be required to conduct additional clean up at sites where we have already participated in remediation efforts or to take remediation action with regard to sites formerly used in connection with our operations.  We may be required to pay for a portion or all of the costs of clean up or remediation at sites we never owned or on which we never operated if we are found to have arranged for treatment or disposal of hazardous substances on the sites.  In cases of joint and several liability, we may be obligated to pay a disproportionate share of cleanup costs if other responsible parties are financially insolvent.INCREASED REGULATION ASSOCIATED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS COULD IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL COSTS ON BOTH OUR STEELMAKING AND METALS RECYCLING OPERATIONS.The U.S. government and various governmental agencies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impact of climate change.   International treaties or agreements may also result in increasing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, including the introduction of carbon emissions trading mechanisms.  Any such regulation regarding climate change and greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions could impose significant costs on our steelmaking and metals recycling operations and on the operations of our customers and suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs in order to comply with current or future laws or regulations concerning and limitations imposed on our operations by virtue of climate change and GHG emissions laws and regulations.  The potential costs of ""allowances,"" ""offsets"" or ""credits"" that may be part of potential cap-and-trade programs or similar future regulatory measures are still uncertain.  Any adopted future climate change and GHG regulations could negatively impact our ability (and that of our customers and suppliers) to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations.  From a medium and long-term perspective, as a result of these regulatory initiatives, we may see an increase in costs relating to our assets that emit significant amounts of greenhouse gases.  These regulatory initiatives will be either voluntary or mandatory and may impact our operations directly or through our suppliers or customers.  Until the timing, scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known, we cannot predict the effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, but such effect could be materially adverse to our business, financial condition, and results of operations.RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMPANYPOTENTIAL LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS CREDIT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.We could be adversely affected if our banks refused to honor their contractual commitments or ceased lending.  Our senior unsecured debt is rated by Standard & Poor's Corporation (BB+) and Moody's Investors Service (Ba2).  In determining our credit ratings, the rating agencies consider a number of both quantitative and qualitative factors.  These factors include earnings (loss), fixed charges such as interest, cash flows, total debt outstanding, off-balance sheet obligations and other commitments, total capitalization and various ratios calculated from these factors.  The rating agencies also consider predictability of cash flows, business strategy and diversity, industry conditions and contingencies. OUR CUSTOMERS' INABILITY TO OBTAIN CREDIT MAY RESULT IN THEIR DEFAULT ON THE DEBTS THEY OWE TO US.If the recent constraints on access to credit continue for a prolonged period, some of our customers may struggle or fail to meet their obligations to pay us, especially if they in turn experience defaults on receivables due from their customers.  A continued economic downturn could result in our incurring bad debt costs in excess of our expectations and prior experience. In certain markets, we have experienced a consolidation among those entities to whom we sell. This consolidation, along with higher metals and other commodity prices, has resulted in an increased credit risk spread among fewer customers, often without a corresponding strengthening of their financial status.  We use credit insurance both in the United States and internationally to mitigate the risk of customer insolvency.  However, it is possible that we may not be capable of recovering all of our insured losses if the insurers with whom our accounts receivable are insured experience significant losses threatening their viability.  Additionally, credit insurance policies typically have relatively short policy periods and require pre-approval of customers with maximum insured limits established by the customer. If credit insurers incur large losses, the insurance may be more difficult and more costly to secure and may be on less favorable terms.  While in many international sales transactions we require letters of credit from financial institutions, which we believe to be financially secure, we may be at risk in the event the financial institution subsequently fails and the customer is unable to pay for the products we sold.  A significant amount of our accounts receivable are considered to be open account uninsured accounts receivable.  We regularly maintain a substantial amount of accounts receivable ($989.7 million at August 31, 2013). POTENTIAL IMPACT OF OUR CUSTOMERS' NON-COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING COMMERCIAL CONTRACTS AND COMMITMENTS.Most consumers of the metals products we sell have been negatively impacted by the recession and the continued slow recovery therefrom.  Due to their economic hardship or the contraction in their operations or due to the fact that the prices for many of the products we sell have declined since the customers entered into the contracts with us, some of our customers have sought to renegotiate or cancel their existing purchase commitments.  In addition, some of our customers have breached previously agreed upon contracts to buy our products by refusing delivery of the products.  Where appropriate, we have and will in the future pursue litigation to recover our damages resulting from customer contract defaults.  A large number of our customers defaulting on existing contractual obligations to purchase our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.THE AGREEMENTS GOVERNING OUR NOTES AND OUR OTHER DEBT CONTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS AND IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON OUR BUSINESS.The indenture governing our 6.50% notes due 2017, 7.35% notes due 2018 and 4.875% notes due 2023 contains restrictions on our ability to create liens, sell assets, enter into sale and leaseback transactions and consolidate or merge.  In addition to these restrictions, our credit facility contains covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things, enter into transactions with affiliates and guarantee the debt of some of our subsidiaries.  Our credit facility also requires that we meet certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios, including a maximum debt to capitalization and interest coverage ratios.Other agreements that we may enter into in the future may contain covenants imposing significant restrictions on our business that are similar to, or in addition to, the covenants under our existing agreements.  These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions.  The breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the indenture governing the notes or under our other debt agreements.  An event of default under our debt agreements would permit some of our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest.  If we were unable to repay debt to our secured lenders or if we incur secured debt in the future, these lenders could proceed against the collateral securing that debt.  In addition, acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on the notes.INCREASES IN THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR RELATIVE TO OTHER CURRENCIES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.An increase in the value of the U.S. dollar may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, and in particular, the increased strength of the U.S. dollar as compared to China's renminbi or the euro dollar could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. A strong U.S. dollar makes imported metal products less expensive, resulting in more imports of steel products into the United States by our foreign competitors, while a weak U.S. dollar may have the opposite impact on imports. With the exception of exports of nonferrous scrap metal by our Americas Recycling segment, we have not recently been a significant exporter of metal products from our United States operations.  Economic difficulties in some large steel producing regions of the world, resulting in lower local demand for steel products, have historically encouraged greater steel exports to the United States at depressed prices which can be exacerbated by a strong dollar.  As a result, our products that are made in the United States may become relatively more expensive as compared to imported steel, which has had and in the future could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.A strong U.S. dollar may also hamper our international marketing and distribution business.  Weak local currencies limit the amount of U.S. dollar denominated products that we can import for our international operations and limit our ability to be competitive against local producers selling in local currencies.OPERATING INTERNATIONALLY CARRIES RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.Our foreign operations generated approximately 27% of our 2013 revenue.  We have significant facilities in Poland and Australia.  Our marketing and trading offices are located in most major markets of the world, and our suppliers and customers are located throughout the world.  Our marketing and distribution segment relies on substantial international shipments of materials and products in the ordinary course of its business.  Our stability, growth and profitability are subject to a number of risks inherent in doing business internationally in addition to the currency exchange risk discussed above, including:•political, military, terrorist or major pandemic events;•legal and regulatory requirements or limitations imposed by foreign governments (particularly those with significant steel consumption or steel related production including China, Brazil, Russia and India) including quotas, tariffs or other protectionist trade barriers, adverse tax law changes, nationalization or currency restrictions; •disruptions or delays in shipments caused by customs compliance or government agencies; and •potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations.These factors may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.WE RELY ON THE AVAILABILITY OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS FOR OUR MINIMILL OPERATIONS.  DISRUPTIONS IN DELIVERY OR SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN ENERGY COSTS, INCLUDING CRUDE OIL PRICES, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.Minimills melt steel scrap in electric arc furnaces and use natural gas to heat steel billets for rolling into finished products.  As large consumers of electricity and gas, often the largest in the geographic area where our minimills are located, we must have dependable delivery of electricity and natural gas in order to operate.  Accordingly, we are at risk in the event of an energy disruption. Prolonged black-outs or brown-outs or disruptions caused by natural disasters such as hurricanes would substantially disrupt our production.  While we have not suffered prolonged production delays due to our inability to access electricity or natural gas, several of our competitors have experienced such occurrences. Prolonged substantial increases in energy costs would have an adverse effect on the costs of operating our minimills and would negatively impact our gross margins unless we were able to fully pass through the additional expense to our customers.  Our finished steel products are typically delivered by truck.  Rapid increases in the price of fuel attributable to increases in crude oil prices would increase our costs and adversely affect many of our customers' financial results, which in turn could result in reduced margins and declining demand for our products.  Rapid increases in fuel costs may also negatively impact our ability to charter ships for international deliveries at anticipated freight rates, thereby decreasing our margins on those transactions or causing our customers to look for alternative sources.IF WE LOSE THE SERVICES OF KEY EMPLOYEES WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR OPERATIONS AND MEET OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES.Our future success depends, in large part, on the continued service of our officers and other key employees and our ability to continue to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel.  These employees are integral to our success based on their expertise and knowledge of our business and products.  We compete for such personnel with other companies, including public and private company competitors who may periodically offer more favorable terms of employment.  The loss or interruption of the services of a number of our key employees could reduce our ability to effectively manage our operations due to the fact that we may not be able to find appropriate replacement personnel in a timely manner should the need arise.WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY COMPETING WITH COMPANIES THAT HAVE A LOWER COST STRUCTURE OR ACCESS TO GREATER FINANCIAL RESOURCES.We compete with regional, national and foreign manufacturers and traders. Consolidation among participants in the steel manufacturing and recycling industries has resulted in fewer competitors but several which are significantly larger than us.  Some of our larger competitors have greater financial resources and more diverse businesses than us.  Some of our foreign competitors may be able to pursue business opportunities without regard to certain of the laws and regulations with which we must comply, such as environmental regulations.  These companies may have a lower cost structure, more operating flexibility and consequently they may be able to offer better prices and more services than we can.  There is no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with these companies.  Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.OUR MINIMILLS REQUIRE CONTINUOUS CAPITAL INVESTMENTS THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN.We must make regular substantial capital investments in our steel minimills to maintain the minimills, lower production costs and remain competitive.  We cannot be certain that we will have sufficient internally generated cash or acceptable external financing to make necessary substantial capital expenditures in the future.  The availability of external financing depends on many factors outside of our control, including capital market conditions and the overall performance of the economy.  If funding is insufficient, we may be unable to develop or enhance our minimills, take advantage of business opportunities and respond to competitive pressures.SCRAP AND OTHER SUPPLIES FOR OUR BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT PRICE FLUCTUATIONS, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.We depend on ferrous scrap, the primary feedstock for our steel minimills, and other supplies such as graphite electrodes and ferroalloys for our steel minimill operations. The price of scrap and other supplies has historically been subject to significant fluctuation, and we may not be able to adjust our product prices to recover the costs of rapid increases in material prices, especially over the short-term and in our domestic fabrication segment's fixed price contracts. Our profitability would be adversely affected if we are unable to pass on to our customers increased raw material and supply costs.Our Arkansas mill does not have melting capacity, so it is dependent on an adequate supply of competitively priced used rail.  The availability of used rail fluctuates with the pace of railroad abandonments, rail replacement by railroads in the United States and abroad and demand for used rail from other domestic and foreign rail rerolling mills.  Price increases for used rail could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.UNEXPECTED EQUIPMENT FAILURES MAY LEAD TO PRODUCTION CURTAILMENTS OR SHUTDOWNS.Interruptions in our production capabilities would adversely affect our production costs, steel available for sale and earnings for the affected period.  Our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of steel-making equipment, such as our furnaces, continuous casters and rolling equipment, as well as electrical equipment, such as transformers.  This equipment may, on occasion, be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures.  We have experienced, and may in the future experience, material plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such equipment failures.  In addition to equipment failures, our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, explosions or violent weather conditions.COMPETITION FROM OTHER MATERIALS MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.In many applications, steel competes with other materials, such as aluminum and plastics (particularly in the automobile industry), cement, composites, glass and wood.  Increased use of or additional substitutes for steel products could adversely affect future market prices and demand for steel products.HEDGING TRANSACTIONS MAY EXPOSE US TO LOSSES OR LIMIT OUR POTENTIAL GAINS.Our product lines and worldwide operations expose us to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates.  As part of our risk management program, we use financial instruments, including metals commodity futures, natural gas forward contracts, freight forward contracts, foreign currency exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts.  While intended to reduce the effects of the fluctuations, these transactions may limit our potential gains or expose us to losses.  If our counterparties to such transactions or the sponsors of the exchanges through which these transactions are offered, such as the London Metal Exchange, fail to honor their obligations due to financial distress, we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipated gains from these transactions.We enter into the foreign currency exchange forward contracts as economic hedges of trade commitments or anticipated commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency to mitigate the effects of changes in currency rates. These foreign exchange commitments are dependent on timely performance by our counterparties.  Their failure to perform could result in our having to close these hedges without the anticipated underlying transaction and could result in losses if foreign currency exchange rates have changed.WE ARE INVOLVED AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BECOME INVOLVED IN VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS THAT MAY RESULT IN FINES, PENALTIES OR JUDGMENTS BEING ASSESSED AGAINST US OR LIABILITY IMPOSED UPON US WHICH WE CANNOT PRESENTLY ESTIMATE OR REASONABLY FORESEE AND WHICH MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, called CERCLA or Superfund, or similar state statutes, we may have obligations to conduct investigation and remediation activities associated with alleged releases of hazardous substances or to reimburse the Environmental Protection Agency (the ""EPA"") (or state agencies as applicable) for such activities and to pay for natural resource damages associated with alleged releases. We have been named a potentially responsible party (""PRP"") at several Federal and state Superfund sites because the EPA or an equivalent state agency contends that we and other potentially responsible scrap metal suppliers are liable for the cleanup of those sites as a result of having sold scrap metal to unrelated manufacturers for recycling as a raw material in the manufacture of new products.  We are involved in litigation or administrative proceedings with regard to several of these sites in which we are contesting, or at the appropriate time may contest, our liability.  In addition, we have received information requests with regard to other sites which may be under consideration by the EPA as potential CERCLA sites.We are presently participating in PRP organizations at several sites, which are paying for certain remediation expenses.  Although we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure to loss in connection with various environmental matters or the effect on our consolidated financial position, we make accruals as warranted. In addition, although we do not believe that a reasonably possible range of loss in excess of amounts accrued for pending lawsuits, claims or proceedings would be material to our financial statements, additional developments may occur, and due to inherent uncertainties, including evolving remediation technology, changing regulations, possible third-party contributions, the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process, the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors, the amounts we ultimately are required to pay could vary significantly from the amounts we accrue, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.WE ARE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.We are involved in various litigation matters, including regulatory proceedings, administrative proceedings, governmental investigations, environmental matters and construction contract disputes.  The nature of our operations also exposes us to possible litigation claims in the future.  Because of the uncertain nature of litigation and coverage decisions, we cannot predict the outcome of these matters.  These matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Litigation is very costly, and the costs associated with prosecuting and defending litigation matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Although we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure to loss in connection with litigation matters, we make accruals as warranted.  However, the amounts that we accrue could vary significantly from the amounts we actually pay, due to inherent uncertainties and the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process, the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors.SOME OF OUR OPERATIONS PRESENT SIGNIFICANT RISK OF INJURY OR DEATH.The industrial activities conducted at our facilities present significant risk of serious injury or death to our employees, customers or other visitors to our operations, notwithstanding our safety precautions, including our material compliance with Federal, state and local employee health and safety regulations, and we may be unable to avoid material liabilities for injuries or deaths.  We maintain workers' compensation insurance to address the risk of incurring material liabilities for injuries or deaths, but there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage will be adequate or will continue to be available on the terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could result in material liabilities to us for any injuries or deaths.HEALTH CARE LEGISLATION COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED COSTS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR WORKFORCE.Recently enacted health care mandates may cause us to evaluate the scope of health benefits offered to our workforce and the method in which they are delivered, and increase our and our employees' costs.  If we are not able to offer a competitive level of benefits, our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel may be adversely affected.  Higher health care costs may result in (i) an inability to reinvest sufficient capital in our operations, (ii) an inability to sustain dividends, (iii) lowered debt ratings and (iv) an increase in the cost of capital, all of which may have a negative effect on the price of our common stock"
1,CMC,COMMERCIAL METALS,2012-10-30,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSThere are inherent risks and uncertainties associated with our business that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Set forth below are descriptions of those risks and uncertainties that we currently believe to be material, but the risks and uncertainties described are not the only risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRYOUR INDUSTRY IS VULNERABLE TO GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE SLOW RECOVERY FROM THE RECENT RECESSION AND THE RISK OF A RECESSION RELAPSE.Our financial results are substantially dependent upon the overall economic conditions in the United States and the European Union. The sluggish pace of recovery from the deep global recession that began in the United States in December 2007 and officially ended in June 2009 has continued to have an adverse effect on the demand for our products and, consequently, our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, uncertainties in Europe regarding the financial sector and sovereign debt and the potential impact on banks in other regions of the world has continued to weigh on global and domestic growth.  Metals industries have historically been vulnerable to significant declines in consumption and product pricing during prolonged periods of economic downturn. Likewise the pace of construction has historically slowed significantly during economic downturns. Our geographic concentration in the southern and southwestern United States as well as Central Europe, Australia, China, and the Middle East exposes us to the local market conditions in these regions. Economic downturns in these areas or decisions by governments that have an impact on the level and pace of overall economic activity in a particular region could also adversely affect our sales and profitability.10Although we believe that the long-term prospectus for the steel industry remain bright, we are unable to predict the duration of the depressed economic conditions that are contributing to reduced demand for our products.  Future economic downturns or a prolonged period of slow growth or economic stagnation could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.OUR INDUSTRY IS CYCLICAL AND PROLONGED PERIODS OF SLOW ECONOMIC GROWTH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.Our business supports cyclical industries such as commercial, residential and government construction, energy, metals service center, petrochemical and original equipment manufacturing. We may experience significant fluctuations in demand for our products from these industries based on economic conditions, energy prices, consumer demand and decisions by governments to fund infrastructure projects such as highways, schools, energy plants and airports. As a result of the volatility in the industries we serve, we may have difficulty increasing or maintaining our level of sales or profitability. Our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected if the industries we serve suffer a prolonged downturn or anemic growth. Although the residential housing market is not a significant direct factor in our business, related commercial and infrastructure construction activities, such as shopping centers, schools and roads, could be impacted by a prolonged slump in new housing construction.Our industry is characterized by low backlogs, which means that our business, results of operations and financial condition are promptly affected by short-term economic fluctuations.THE SCRAP METAL RECYCLING INDUSTRY HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN, AND IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN, HIGHLY CYCLICAL. A PROLONGED PERIOD OF LOW SCRAP PRICES OR A FALL IN SCRAP METAL PRICES, COULD RESULT IN THE WEAKENING OF INBOUND SCRAP FLOWS AND THEREBY REDUCED OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN, PROCESS AND SELL RECYCLED MATERIALS AND THIS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR METALS RECYCLING OPERATIONS' RESULTS. Scrap metal prices are volatile and operating results within the metals recycling industry, in general, have historically been cyclical, and are expected to remain, highly cyclical in nature. Similarly, but not necessarily paralleling the price fluctuations in the steel business, the purchase prices for automobile bodies and various other grades of obsolete and industrial scrap, as well as the selling prices for processed and recycled scrap metals we utilize in our own manufacturing process or we resell to others through our metals recycling operations, are also highly volatile. As a metals recycler, we may attempt to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices by adjusting the scrap metal purchase prices we pay to others, but our ability to do this may be limited by competitive or other factors during periods of low scrap prices, when inbound scrap flow may slow considerably, as scrap generators hold onto their scrap in the hope of getting higher prices later; conversely, increased foreign demand for scrap due to economic expansion in countries such as China, India, Brazil, and Turkey can result in an outflow of available domestic scrap as well as higher scrap prices that cannot always be passed on to domestic scrap consumers further reducing the available domestic scrap flows and scrap margins all of which could adversely affect our sales and profitability.A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN CHINA'S STEEL CONSUMPTION OR INCREASED CHINESE STEEL PRODUCTION SUBSTANTIALLY EXCEEDING LOCAL DEMAND MAY RESULT IN CHINA BECOMING A LARGE EXPORTER OF STEEL AND DISRUPTION TO WORLD STEEL MARKETS.Chinese economic expansion has affected the availability and heightened the volatility of many commodities that we market and use in our manufacturing process, including steel. Expansions and contractions in China's economy can have major effects on the price of our finished steel products and many commodities that affect us such as secondary metals, energy, marine freight rates, steel making supplies such as ferroalloys and graphite electrodes, and materials we market, such as iron ore and coke. If Chinese demand weakens or Chinese steel production expands to the point that it significantly exceeds the country's consumption, prices for many of the products that we both sell to and export from China may fall, causing erosion in our gross margins and subjecting us to possible renegotiation of contracts or increases in bad debts. Significant exports from China of steel in the product lines we manufacture would likely cause our selling prices to decline and negatively impact our volumes and gross margins.RAPID AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF METALS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.Prices for most metals in which we deal have experienced increased volatility over the last several years, and such increased price volatility impacts us in several ways. Some of our operations, such as our fabrication operations, may benefit from rapidly decreasing steel prices as their material cost for previously contracted fixed price work declines. Others, such as our Americas Mills and International Mill segments, would likely experience reduced margins and may be forced to liquidate high cost inventory at reduced margins or losses until prices stabilize. Sudden increases could have the opposite effect. Overall, we believe that rapid substantial price changes are not to our industry's benefit. Our customer and supplier base would be impacted due to uncertainty as to future prices. A reluctance to purchase inventory in the face of extreme price decreases or to 11sell quickly during a period of rapid price increases would likely reduce our volume of business. Marginal industry participants or speculators may attempt to participate to an unhealthy extent during a period of rapid price escalation with a substantial risk of contract default if prices suddenly reverse. Risks of default in contract performance by customers or suppliers as well as an increased risk of bad debts and customer credit exposure could increase during periods of rapid and substantial price changes.EXCESS CAPACITY IN OUR INDUSTRY COULD INCREASE THE LEVEL OF STEEL IMPORTS INTO THE UNITED STATES, RESULTING IN LOWER DOMESTIC PRICES WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SALES, MARGINS AND PROFITABILITY.Steel-making capacity exceeds demand for steel products in some countries. Rather than reducing employment by rationalizing capacity with consumption, steel manufacturers in these countries (often with local government assistance or subsidies in various forms) have traditionally periodically exported steel at prices significantly below their home market prices and which may not reflect their costs of production or capital. This supply of imports can decrease the sensitivity of domestic steel prices to increases in demand or decrease our ability to recover our manufacturing costs. The excess capacity may create downward pressure on our steel prices which would adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability.COMPLIANCE WITH AND CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND REMEDIATION REQUIREMENTS COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OPERATING COSTS.Existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, and future laws and regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is a significant factor in our business. We are subject to local, state, Federal and international environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other matters, waste disposal, air emissions, waste and storm water effluent and disposal and employee health. New facilities that we may build, especially steel minimills, are required to obtain several environmental permits before significant construction or commencement of operations. Delays in obtaining permits or unanticipated conditions in such permits could delay the project or increase construction costs or operating expenses. Our manufacturing and recycling operations produce significant amounts of by-products, some of which are handled as industrial waste or hazardous waste. For example, our minimills generate electric arc furnace dust (“EAF dust”), which the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) and other regulatory authorities classify as hazardous waste. EAF dust and other industrial waste and hazardous waste require special handling, recycling or disposal.In addition, the primary feed materials for the shredders operated by our scrap metal recycling facilities are automobile hulks and obsolete household appliances. Approximately 20% of the weight of an automobile hull consists of unrecyclable material known as shredder fluff. After the segregation of ferrous and saleable nonferrous metals, shredder fluff remains. We, along with others in the recycling industry, interpret Federal regulations to require shredder fluff to meet certain criteria and pass a toxic leaching test to avoid classification as a hazardous waste. We also endeavor to remove hazardous contaminants from the feed material prior to shredding. As a result, we believe the shredder fluff we generate is not normally considered or properly classified as hazardous waste. If the laws, regulations or testing methods change with regard to EAF dust or shredder fluff or other by-products, we may incur additional significant expenditures.Legal requirements are changing frequently and are subject to interpretation. New laws, regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities, together with uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels, testing and sampling procedures, new pollution control technology and cost/benefit analysis based on market conditions are all factors that may increase our future expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. Accordingly, we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of future compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. We cannot predict whether such costs would be able to be passed on to customers through product price increases. Competitors in various regions or countries where environmental regulation is less restrictive, subject to different interpretation or generally not enforced, may enjoy a competitive advantage.We may also be required to conduct additional clean up at sites where we have already participated in remediation efforts or to take remediation action with regard to sites formerly used in connection with our operations. We may be required to pay for a portion or all of the costs of clean up or remediation at sites we never owned or on which we never operated if we are found to have arranged for treatment or disposal of hazardous substances on the sites. In cases of joint and several liability, we may be obligated to pay a disproportionate share of cleanup costs if other responsible parties are financially insolvent.INCREASED REGULATION ASSOCIATED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS COULD IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL COSTS ON BOTH OUR STEELMAKING AND METALS RECYCLING OPERATIONS.The U.S. government and various governmental agencies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impact of climate change. International treaties or agreements may also result in increasing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, including the introduction of carbon emissions trading mechanisms. Any such regulation regarding climate change and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions could impose significant costs on our steelmaking and metals 12recycling operations and on the operations of our customers and suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs in order to comply with current or future laws or regulations concerning and limitations imposed on our operations by virtue of climate change and GHG emissions laws and regulations. The potential costs of “allowances,” “offsets” or “credits” that may be part of potential cap-and-trade programs or similar future regulatory measures are still uncertain. Any adopted future climate change and GHG regulations could negatively impact our ability (and that of our customers and suppliers) to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. From a medium and long-term perspective, as a result of these regulatory initiatives, we may see an increase in costs relating to our assets that emit significant amounts of greenhouse gases. These regulatory initiatives will be either voluntary or mandatory and may impact our operations directly or through our suppliers or customers. Until the timing, scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known, we cannot predict the effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMPANYPOTENTIAL LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS CREDIT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.We could be adversely affected if our banks refused to honor their contract commitments or ceased lending. Events in the global credit markets, including the failure, takeover or rescue by various government entities of major financial institutions, have created uncertainty of credit availability to an extent not experienced in recent decades. Our senior unsecured debt is rated by Standard & Poor's Corporation (BB+) and Moody's Investors Service (Ba2). In determining our credit ratings, the rating agencies consider a number of both quantitative and qualitative factors. These factors include earnings (loss), fixed charges such as interest, cash flows, total debt outstanding, off-balance sheet obligations and other commitments, total capitalization and various ratios calculated from these factors. The rating agencies also consider predictability of cash flows, business strategy and diversity, industry conditions and contingencies. OUR CUSTOMERS' INABILITY TO OBTAIN CREDIT MAY RESULT IN THEIR DEFAULT ON THE DEBTS THEY OWE TO US.If the recent constraints on access to credit continue for a prolonged period, some of our customers may struggle or fail to meet their obligations to pay us, especially if they in turn experience defaults on receivables due from their customers. A continued economic downturn could result in our incurring bad debt costs in excess of our expectations and prior experience. In certain markets, we have experienced a consolidation among those entities to whom we sell. This consolidation, along with higher metals and other commodity prices, has resulted in an increased credit risk spread among fewer customers often without a corresponding strengthening of their financial status. We use credit insurance both in the United States and internationally to mitigate the risk of customer insolvency.  However, it is possible that we may not be capable of recovering all of our insured losses if the insurers with whom our accounts receivable are insured experience significant losses threatening their viability. Additionally, credit insurance policies typically have relatively short policy periods and require pre-approval of customers with maximum insured limits established by the customer. If credit insurers incur large losses, the insurance may be more difficult and more costly to secure and may be on less favorable terms. While in many international sales transactions we require letters of credit from financial institutions, which we believe to be financially secure, we may be at risk in the event the financial institution subsequently fails and the customer is unable to pay for the products we sold. A significant amount of our accounts receivable are considered to be open account uninsured accounts receivable. We regularly maintain a substantial amount of accounts receivable ($958.4 million at August 31, 2012). POTENTIAL IMPACT OF OUR CUSTOMERS' NON COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING COMMERCIAL CONTRACTS AND COMMITMENTS.Most consumers of the metals products we sell have been negatively impacted by the recession and the continued slow recovery therefrom.  Due to their economic hardship or the contraction in their operations or due to the fact that the prices for many of the products we sell have declined since the customers entered into the contracts with us, some of our customers have sought to renegotiate or cancel their existing purchase commitments. In addition, some of our customers have breached previously agreed upon contracts to buy our products by refusing delivery of the products. Where appropriate, we have and will in the future pursue litigation to recover our damages resulting from customer contract defaults. A large number of our customers defaulting on existing contractual obligations to purchase our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.THE AGREEMENTS GOVERNING OUR NOTES AND OUR OTHER DEBT CONTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS AND IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON OUR BUSINESS.The indenture governing our 5.625% notes due 2013, 6.50% notes due 2017 and 7.35% notes due 2018 contains restrictions on our ability to create liens, sell assets, enter into sale and leaseback transactions and consolidate or merge. In addition to these restrictions, our credit facility contains covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things, enter into transactions with 13affiliates and guarantee the debt of some of our subsidiaries.  Our credit facility also requires that we meet certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios, including a maximum debt to capitalization and interest coverage ratios.Other agreements that we may enter into in the future may contain covenants imposing significant restrictions on our business that are similar to, or in addition to, the covenants under our existing agreements. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. The breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the indenture governing the notes or under our other debt agreements. An event of default under our debt agreements would permit some of our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If we were unable to repay debt to our secured lenders or if we incur secured debt in the future, these lenders could proceed against the collateral securing that debt. In addition, acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on the notes.FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR RELATIVE TO OTHER CURRENCIES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In particular, major changes in the rate of exchange of China's renminbi or the value of the euro to the U.S. dollar could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. A strong U.S. dollar makes imported metal products less expensive, resulting in more imports of steel products into the United States by our foreign competitors, while a weak U.S. dollar may have the opposite impact on imports. With the exception of exports of nonferrous scrap metal by our Americas Recycling segment, we have not recently been a significant exporter of metal products from our United States operations. Economic difficulties in some large steel producing regions of the world, resulting in lower local demand for steel products, have historically encouraged greater steel exports to the United States at depressed prices which can be exacerbated by a strong dollar. As a result, our products that are made in the United States may become relatively more expensive as compared to imported steel, which has had and in the future could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.A strong U.S. dollar hampers our international marketing and distribution business. Weak local currencies limit the amount of U.S. dollar denominated products that we can import for our international operations and limit our ability to be competitive against local producers selling in local currencies.OPERATING INTERNATIONALLY CARRIES RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.Our foreign operations generated approximately 29% of our 2012 revenue.  We have significant facilities in Poland and Australia. Our marketing and trading offices are located in most major markets of the world, and our suppliers and customers are located throughout the world. Our marketing and distribution segment relies on substantial international shipments of materials and products in the ordinary course of its business. Our stability, growth and profitability are subject to a number of risks inherent in doing business internationally in addition to the currency exchange risk discussed above, including:•political, military, terrorist or major pandemic events;•legal and regulatory requirements or limitations imposed by foreign governments (particularly those with significant steel consumption or steel related production including China, Brazil, Russia and India) including quotas, tariffs or other protectionist trade barriers, adverse tax law changes, nationalization or currency restrictions;•disruptions or delays in shipments caused by customs compliance or government agencies; and•potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations.These types of events may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.WE RELY ON THE AVAILABILITY OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS FOR OUR MINIMILL OPERATIONS. DISRUPTIONS IN DELIVERY OR SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN ENERGY COSTS, INCLUDING CRUDE OIL PRICES, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.Minimills melt steel scrap in electric arc furnaces and use natural gas to heat steel billets for rolling into finished products. As large consumers of electricity and gas, often the largest in the geographic area where our minimills are located, we must have dependable delivery of electricity and natural gas in order to operate. Accordingly, we are at risk in the event of an energy disruption. Prolonged black-outs or brown-outs or disruptions caused by natural disasters such as hurricanes would substantially disrupt our production. While we have not suffered prolonged production delays due to our inability to access electricity or natural gas, several of our competitors have experienced such occurrences. Prolonged substantial increases in 14energy costs would have an adverse effect on the costs of operating our minimills and would negatively impact our gross margins unless we were able to fully pass through the additional expense to our customers. Our finished steel products are typically delivered by truck. Rapid increases in the price of fuel attributable to increases in crude oil prices will increase our costs and adversely affect many of our customers' financial results, which in turn could result in reduced margins and declining demand for our products. Rapid increases in fuel costs may also negatively impact our ability to charter ships for international deliveries at anticipated freight rates, thereby decreasing our margins on those transactions or causing our customers to look for alternative sources.IF WE LOSE THE SERVICES OF KEY EMPLOYEES WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR OPERATIONS AND MEET OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES.Our future success depends, in large part, on the continued service of our officers and other key employees and our ability to continue to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel. These employees are integral to our success based on their expertise and knowledge of our business and products. We compete for such personnel with other companies, including public and private company competitors who may periodically offer more favorable terms of employment. The loss or interruption of the services of a number of our key employees could reduce our ability to effectively manage our operations due to the fact that we may not be able to find in a timely manner, appropriate replacement personnel should the need arise.WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY COMPETING WITH COMPANIES THAT HAVE A LOWER COST STRUCTURE OR ACCESS TO GREATER FINANCIAL RESOURCES.We compete with regional, national and foreign manufacturers and traders. Consolidation among participants in the steel manufacturing and recycling industries has resulted in fewer competitors but several which are significantly larger than us. Some of our larger competitors have greater financial resources and more diverse businesses than us. Some of our foreign competitors may be able to pursue business opportunities without regard to certain of the laws and regulations with which we must comply, such as environmental regulations. These companies may have a lower cost structure, more operating flexibility and consequently they may be able to offer better prices and more services than we can. There is no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with these companies. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.OUR MINIMILLS REQUIRE CONTINUOUS CAPITAL INVESTMENTS THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN.We must make regular substantial capital investments in our steel minimills to maintain the minimills, lower production costs and remain competitive. We cannot be certain that we will have sufficient internally generated cash or acceptable external financing to make necessary substantial capital expenditures in the future. The availability of external financing depends on many factors outside of our control, including capital market conditions and the overall performance of the economy. If funding is insufficient, we may be unable to develop or enhance our minimills, take advantage of business opportunities and respond to competitive pressures.SCRAP AND OTHER SUPPLIES FOR OUR BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT PRICE FLUCTUATIONS, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.We depend on ferrous scrap, the primary feedstock for our steel minimills, and other supplies such as graphite electrodes and ferroalloys for our steel minimill operations. The price of scrap and other supplies has historically been subject to significant fluctuation, and we may not be able to adjust our product prices to recover the costs of rapid increases in material prices, especially over the short-term and in our domestic fabrication segment's fixed price contracts. Our future profitability will be adversely affected if we are unable to pass on to our customers increased raw material and supply costs.The raw material used in manufacturing copper tubing is copper scrap, supplemented occasionally by virgin copper ingot. Copper scrap is subject to rapid price fluctuations related to the price and supply of virgin copper. Price increases for high quality copper scrap could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our Arkansas mill does not have melting capacity, so it is dependent on an adequate supply of competitively priced used rail. The availability of used rail fluctuates with the pace of railroad abandonments, rail replacement by railroads in the United States and abroad and demand for used rail from other domestic and foreign rail rerolling mills. Price increases for used rail could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.UNEXPECTED EQUIPMENT FAILURES MAY LEAD TO PRODUCTION CURTAILMENTS OR SHUTDOWNS.Interruptions in our production capabilities would adversely affect our production costs, steel available for sales and earnings for the affected period. Our manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of steel-making equipment, such as our furnaces, continuous casters and rolling equipment, as well as electrical equipment, such as transformers. This equipment may, on occasion, be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, material plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such equipment failures. In addition to equipment failures, our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, 15explosions or violent weather conditions.COMPETITION FROM OTHER MATERIALS MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.In many applications, steel competes with other materials, such as aluminum and plastics (particularly in the automobile industry), cement, composites, glass and wood. Increased use of or additional substitutes for steel products could adversely affect future market prices and demand for steel products.HEDGING TRANSACTIONS MAY EXPOSE US TO LOSSES OR LIMIT OUR POTENTIAL GAINS.Our product lines and worldwide operations expose us to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. As part of our risk management program, we use financial instruments, including metals commodity futures, natural gas forward contracts, freight forward contracts, foreign currency exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts. While intended to reduce the effects of the fluctuations, these transactions may limit our potential gains or expose us to losses. If our counterparties to such transactions or the sponsors of the exchanges through which these transactions are offered, such as the London Metal Exchange, fail to honor their obligations due to financial distress we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipated gains from these transactions.We enter into the foreign currency exchange forward contracts as economic hedges of trade commitments or anticipated commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency to mitigate the effects of changes in currency rates. These foreign exchange commitments are dependent on timely performance by our counterparties. Their failure to perform could result in our having to close these hedges without the anticipated underlying transaction and could result in losses if foreign currency exchange rates have changed.WE ARE INVOLVED AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BECOME INVOLVED IN VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS THAT MAY RESULT IN FINES, PENALTIES OR JUDGMENTS BEING ASSESSED AGAINST US OR LIABILITY IMPOSED UPON US WHICH WE CANNOT PRESENTLY ESTIMATE OR REASONABLY FORESEE AND WHICH MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, called CERCLA or Superfund, or similar state statutes, we may have obligations to conduct investigation and remediation activities associated with alleged releases of hazardous substances or to reimburse the EPA (or state agencies as applicable) for such activities and to pay for natural resource damages associated with alleged releases. We have been named a potentially responsible party at several Federal and state Superfund sites because the EPA or an equivalent state agency contends that we and other potentially responsible scrap metal suppliers are liable for the cleanup of those sites as a result of having sold scrap metal to unrelated manufacturers for recycling as a raw material in the manufacture of new products. We are involved in litigation or administrative proceedings with regard to several of these sites in which we are contesting, or at the appropriate time may contest, our liability. In addition, we have received information requests with regard to other sites which may be under consideration by the EPA as potential CERCLA sites.Although we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure to loss in connection with various environmental matters or the effect on our consolidated financial position, we make accruals as warranted. In addition, although we do not believe that a reasonably possible range of loss in excess of amounts accrued for pending lawsuits, claims or proceedings would be material to our financial statements, additional developments may occur, and due to inherent uncertainties, including evolving remediation technology, changing regulations, possible third-party contributions, the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process, the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors, the amounts we ultimately are required to pay could vary significantly from the amounts we accrue, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.WE ARE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.We are involved in various litigation matters, including regulatory proceedings, administrative proceedings, governmental investigations, environmental matters and construction contract disputes. The nature of our operations also exposes us to possible litigation claims in the future. Because of the uncertain nature of litigation and coverage decisions, we cannot predict the outcome of these matters. These matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Litigation is very costly, and the costs associated with prosecuting and defending litigation matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure to loss in connection with litigation matters, we make accruals as warranted. However, the amounts that we accrue could vary significantly from the amounts we actually pay, due to inherent uncertainties and the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process, the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors.16SOME OF OUR OPERATIONS PRESENT SIGNIFICANT RISK OF INJURY OR DEATH.The industrial activities conducted at our facilities present significant risk of serious injury or death to our employees, customers or other visitors to our operations, notwithstanding our safety precautions, including our material compliance with Federal, state and local employee health and safety regulations, and we may be unable to avoid material liabilities for injuries or deaths. We maintain workers' compensation insurance to address the risk of incurring material liabilities for injuries or deaths, but there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage will be adequate or will continue to be available on the terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could result in material liabilities to us for any injuries or deaths.HEALTH CARE LEGISLATION COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED COSTS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR WORKFORCE.Recently enacted health care mandates may cause us to evaluate the scope of health benefits offered to our workforce and the method in which they are delivered, and increase our and our employees' costs. If we are not able to offer a competitive level of benefits, our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel may be adversely affected. Higher health care costs may result in (i) an inability to reinvest sufficient capital in our operations, (ii) an inability to sustain dividends, (iii) lowered debt ratings and (iv) an increase in the cost of capital, all of which may have a negative effect on the price of our common stock"
14,CMC,COMMERCIAL METALS,2011-10-31,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS     Before making an investment in our company, you should be aware of various risks, includingthose described below. You should carefully consider these risk factors together with all of theother information included in this11Table of ContentsAnnual Report on Form 10-K. The risks described below are notthe only risks facing us. If any of these risksactually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows couldbe materially adversely affected and you may lose all or part of your investment.RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRYOUR INDUSTRY IS AFFECTED BY GLOBAL ECONOMIC FACTORS INCLUDING THE RISK OF A RECESSION AND OURCUSTOMERS ACCESS TO CREDIT FACILITIES.     Our financial results are substantially dependent upon the overall economic conditions in theUnited States and the European Union. A continued recession in the United States, the EuropeanUnion, or globally  or the public perception that a recession is continuing  could furthersubstantially decrease the demand for our products and adversely affect our business. Many of ourproducts are commodities subject to cyclical fluctuations in supply and demand in metal consumingindustries and construction. Metals industries have historically been vulnerable to significantdeclines in consumption and product pricing during prolonged periods of economic downturn. Likewisethe pace of construction has historically slowed significantly during economic downturns. Many ofour customers rely on access to credit to adequately fund their operations or to financeconstruction projects. The inability of our customers to access credit facilities could adverselyaffect our business by reducing our sales, increasing our exposure to accounts receivable,increasing our bad debts and reducing our profitability. Our geographic concentration in thesouthern and southwestern United States as well as Central Europe, Australia, China, and the MiddleEast exposes us to the local market conditions in these regions. Economic downturns in these areasor decisions by governments that have an impact on the level and pace of overall economic activityin a particular region could also adversely affect our sales and profitability.OUR INDUSTRY IS CYCLICAL AND PROLONGED ECONOMIC DECLINES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ONOUR BUSINESS.     Our business supports cyclical industries such as commercial, residential and governmentconstruction, energy, metals service center, petrochemical and original equipment manufacturing. Wemay experience significant fluctuations in demand for our products from these industries based oneconomic conditions, energy prices, consumer demand and decisions by governments to fundinfrastructure projects such as highways, schools, energy plants and airports. As a result of thevolatility in the industries we serve, we may have difficulty increasing or maintaining our levelof sales or profitability. If the industries we serve suffer a prolonged downturn, then ourbusiness may be adversely affected. Although the residential housing market is not a significantdirect factor in our business, related commercial and infrastructure construction activities, suchas shopping centers, schools and roads, could be impacted by a prolonged slump in new housingconstruction.     Our industry is characterized by low backlogs, which means that our results of operations arepromptly affected by short-term economic fluctuations.A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN CHINAS STEEL CONSUMPTION OR INCREASED CHINESE STEEL PRODUCTIONSUBSTANTIALLY EXCEEDING LOCAL DEMAND MAY RESULT IN CHINA BECOMING A LARGE EXPORTER OF STEEL ANDDISRUPTION TO WORLD STEEL MARKETS.     Chinese economic expansion has affected the availability and heightened the volatility of manycommodities that we market and use in our manufacturing process, including steel. Expansions andcontractions in Chinas economy can have major effects on the price of our finished steel productsand many commodities that affect us such as secondary metals, energy, marine freight rates, steelmaking supplies such as ferroalloys and graphite electrodes, and materials we market, such as ironore and coke. Should Chinese demand weaken or Chinese steel production be allowed to expandunchecked to the point that it significantly exceeds the countrys consumption, prices for many ofthe products that we both sell to and export from China may fall, causing erosion in our grossmargins and subjecting us to possible renegotiation of contracts or increases in bad debts.Significant exports from China of steel in the product lines we manufacture would likely causeselling prices to decline and negatively impact our volumes and gross margins.12Table of ContentsRAPID AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF METALS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR INDUSTRY.     Prices for most metals in which we deal have experienced increased volatility over the lastseveral years and such increased price volatility impacts us in several ways. Some of ouroperations, such as our fabrication operations, may benefit from rapidly decreasing steel prices astheir material cost for previously contracted fixed price work declines. Others, such as ourAmericas Mills and International Mills segments, would likely experience reduced margins and may beforced to liquidate high cost inventory at reduced margins or losses until prices stabilize. Suddenincreases could have the opposite effect. Overall, we believe that rapid substantial price changesare not to our industrys benefit. Our customer and supplier base would be impacted due touncertainty as to future prices. A reluctance to purchase inventory in the face of extreme pricedecreases or to sell quickly during a period of rapid price increases would likely reduce ourvolume of business. Marginal industry participants or speculators may attempt to participate to anunhealthy extent during a period of rapid price escalation with a substantial risk of contractdefault should prices suddenly reverse. Risks of default in contract performance by customers orsuppliers as well as an increased risk of bad debts and customer credit exposure could increaseduring periods of rapid and substantial price changes.EXCESS CAPACITY IN OUR INDUSTRY COULD INCREASE THE LEVEL OF STEEL IMPORTS INTO THE UNITED STATES,RESULTING IN LOWER DOMESTIC PRICES WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SALES, MARGINS ANDPROFITABILITY.     Steel-making capacity exceeds demand for steel products in some countries. Rather thanreducing employment by rationalizing capacity with consumption, steel manufacturers in thesecountries (often with local government assistance or subsidies in various forms) have traditionallyperiodically exported steel at prices significantly below their home market prices and which maynot reflect their costs of production or capital. This supply of imports can decrease thesensitivity of domestic steel prices to increases in demand or decrease our ability to recover ourmanufacturing costs. The excess capacity may create downward pressure on our steel prices whichwould adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability.COMPLIANCE WITH AND CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND REMEDIATION REQUIREMENTS COULD RESULT INSUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OPERATING COSTS.     Existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, andfuture laws and regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations andfinancial condition. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is a significant factor inour business. We are subject to local, state, Federal and international environmental laws andregulations concerning, among other matters, waste disposal, air emissions, waste and storm watereffluent and disposal and employee health. New facilities that we may build, especially steelminimills, are required to obtain several environmental permits before significant construction orcommencement of operations. Delays in obtaining permits or unanticipated conditions in such permitscould delay the project or increase construction costs or operating expenses. Our manufacturing andrecycling operations produce significant amounts of by-products, some of which are handled asindustrial waste or hazardous waste. For example, our minimills generate electric arc furnace dust(EAF dust), which the EPA and other regulatory authorities classify as hazardous waste. EAF dustand other industrial waste and hazardous waste require special handling, recycling or disposal.     In addition, the primary feed materials for the shredders operated by our scrap metalrecycling facilities are automobile hulks and obsolete household appliances. Approximately 20% ofthe weight of an automobile hull consists of unrecyclable material known as shredder fluff. Afterthe segregation of ferrous and saleable nonferrous metals, shredder fluff remains. We, along withothers in the recycling industry, interpret Federal regulations to require shredder fluff to meetcertain criteria and pass a toxic leaching test to avoid classification as a hazardous waste. Wealso endeavor to remove hazardous contaminants from the feed material prior to shredding. As aresult, we believe the shredder fluff we generate is not normally considered or properly classifiedas hazardous waste. If the13Table of Contentslaws, regulations or testing methods change with regard to EAF dust orshredder fluff or other by-products, we may incur additional significant expenditures.     Legal requirements are changing frequently and are subject to interpretation. New laws,regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities, together with uncertaintyregarding adequate pollution control levels, testing and sampling procedures, new pollution controltechnology and cost benefit analysis based on market conditions are all factors that may increaseour future expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. Accordingly, we are unable topredict the ultimate cost of future compliance with these requirements or their effect on ouroperations. We cannot predict whether such costs would be able to be passed on to customers throughproduct price increases. Competitors in various regions or countries where environmental regulationis less restrictive, subject to different interpretation or generally not enforced, may enjoy acompetitive advantage.     We may also be required to conduct additional clean up at sites where we have alreadyparticipated in remediation efforts or to take remediation action with regard to sites formerlyused in connection with our operations. We may be required to pay for a portion or all of the costsof clean up or remediation at sites we never owned or on which we never operated if we are found tohave arranged for treatment or disposal of hazardous substances on the sites. In cases of joint andseveral liability, we may be obligated to pay a disproportionate share of cleanup costs if otherresponsible parties are financially insolvent.INCREASED REGULATION ASSOCIATED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS COULD IMPOSESIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL COSTS ON BOTH OUR STEELMAKING AND METALS RECYCLING OPERATIONS.     The U.S. government and various governmental agencies have introduced or are contemplatingregulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change. International treatiesor agreements may also result in increasing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, including theintroduction of carbon emissions trading mechanisms. Any such regulation regarding climate changeand greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions could impose significant costs on our steelmaking and metalsrecycling operations and on the operations of our customers and suppliers, including increasedenergy, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs in order tocomply with current or future laws or regulations concerning and limitations imposed on ouroperations by virtue of climate change and GHG emissions laws and regulations. The potential costsof allowances, offsets or credits that may be part of potential cap-and-trade programs orsimilar future regulatory measures are still uncertain. Any adopted future climate change and GHGregulations could negatively impact our ability (and that of our customers and suppliers) tocompete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. From a medium andlong-term perspective, we may see an increase in costs relating to our assets that emit significantamounts of greenhouse gases as a result of these regulatory initiatives. These regulatoryinitiatives will be either voluntary or mandatory and may impact our operations directly or throughour suppliers or customers. Until the timing, scope and extent of any future regulation becomesknown, we cannot predict the effect on our financial condition, operating performance and abilityto compete.RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMPANYPOTENTIAL LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS CREDIT FACILITIES MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OURBUSINESS.     We could be adversely affected if our banks, the buyers of our commercial paper or other ofthe traditional sources supplying our short term borrowing requirements refused to honor theircontract commitments or ceased lending. Events in the global credit markets, including the failure,takeover or rescue by various government entities of major financial institutions, have createduncertainty of credit availability to an extent not experienced in recent decades. Our commercialpaper program is ranked in the third highest category by Moodys Investors Service (P-3) and byStandard & Poors Corporation (A-3). Our senior unsecured debt is investment grade rated byStandard & Poors Corporation (BBB-) and Moodys Investors Service (Baa3). In determining ourcredit ratings, the rating agencies consider a number of both quantitative and qualitative factors.These factors include earnings (loss), fixed charges such as interest, cash flows, total debtoutstanding, off balance sheet obligations and other commitments, total capitalization and variousratios calculated from these factors. The rating agencies also consider predictability of cashflows, business strategy and diversity, industry conditions and contingencies. Lower ratings on our14Table of Contentscommercial paper program or our senior unsecured debt could impair our ability to obtain additionalfinancing and would increase the cost of the financing that we do obtain.SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS MAY DEFAULT ON THE DEBTS THEY OWE TO US.     Should the recent constraints on access to credit continue for a prolonged period, some of ourcustomers may struggle or fail to meet their obligations, especially if they in turn experiencedefaults on receivables due from their customers. A continued recession could result in ourincurring bad debt costs in excess of our expectations and prior experience. In certain markets, wehave experienced a consolidation among those entities to whom we sell. This consolidation, alongwith higher metals and other commodity prices, has resulted in an increased credit risk spreadamong fewer customers often without a corresponding strengthening of their financial status. Wehave expanded our use of credit insurance for accounts receivable in our businesses, however, it ispossible that we may not be capable of recovering all of our insured losses should the insurerswith whom our accounts receivable are insured experience significant losses threatening theirviability. Additionally, credit insurance policies typically have relatively short policy periodsand require pre-approval of customers with maximum insured limits established by the customer.Should credit insurers incur large losses, the insurance may be more difficult to secure and whenavailable, likely only at increased costs with decreased coverage. While in many internationalsales transactions we require letters of credit from financial institutions, which we believe to befinancially secure, we may be at risk in the event the financial institution subsequently fails andthe customer is unable to pay for the products we sold. A significant amount of our accountsreceivable are considered to be open account uninsured accounts receivable. We regularly maintain asubstantial amount of accounts receivable, at year end $957 million. During the fiscal year, wehad net additions to bad debt expense of $0.3 million, charged off accounts receivable of $16.7million and had recoveries of $2.8 million and at year end our allowance for doubtful accounts wasapproximately $16 million.POTENTIAL IMPACT OF OUR CUSTOMERS NON-COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING COMMERCIAL CONTRACTS ANDCOMMITMENTS.     Most consumers of the metals products we sell have been negatively impacted by the recession.Many of our customers have experienced reductions, some substantial, in their operations. Pricesfor many of the metals products we sell have declined, some substantially. These factors havecontributed to attempts by some customers to seek renegotiation or cancellation of their existingpurchase commitments. Some of our customers have breached previously agreed upon contracts to buyour products by refusing delivery of the products. Where appropriate, we have and will in thefuture pursue litigation to recover our damages resulting from customer contract defaults. A largenumber of our customers defaulting on existing contractual obligations to purchase our productscould have a material impact on our results of operations.THE AGREEMENTS GOVERNING THE NOTES AND OUR OTHER DEBT CONTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS AND IMPOSERESTRICTIONS ON OUR BUSINESS.     The indenture governing our 5.625% notes due 2013, 6.50% notes due 2017 and 7.35% notes due2018 contains restrictions on our ability to create liens, sell assets, enter into sale andleaseback transactions and consolidate or merge. In addition, our credit facility containscovenants that place restrictions on our ability to, among other things:  create liens;   enter into transactions with affiliates;   sell assets;   guarantee the debt of some of our subsidiaries; and   consolidate or merge.     Our credit facility also requires that we meet certain financial tests and maintain certainfinancial ratios, including a maximum debt to capitalization and interest coverage ratios.15Table of Contents     Other agreements that we may enter into in the future may contain covenants imposingsignificant restrictions on our business that are similar to, or in addition to, the covenantsunder our existing agreements. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our businessand may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.     Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control,including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. The breach of any of thesecovenants could result in a default under the indenture governing the notes or under our other debtagreements. An event of default under our debt agreements would permit some of our lenders todeclare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaidinterest. If we were unable to repay debt to our secured lenders or if we incur secured debt in thefuture, these lenders could proceed against the collateral securing that debt. In addition,acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on thenotes.FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR RELATIVE TO OTHER CURRENCIES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OURBUSINESS.     Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar may affect our business. In particular, majorchanges in the rate of exchange of Chinas renminbi or the value of the euro to the U.S. dollarcould negatively impact our business. A strong U.S. dollar makes imported metal products lessexpensive, resulting in more imports of steel products into the United States by our foreigncompetitors, while a weak U.S. dollar may have the opposite impact on imports. With the exceptionof exports of nonferrous scrap metal by our Americas Recycling segment, we have not recently been asignificant exporter of metal products from our United States operations. Economic difficulties insome large steel producing regions of the world, resulting in lower local demand for steelproducts, have historically encouraged greater steel exports to the United States at depressedprices which can be exacerbated by a strong dollar. As a result, our products that are made in theUnited States may become relatively more expensive as compared to imported steel, which has had andin the future could have a negative impact on our sales, profitability and cash flows.     A strong U.S. dollar hampers our international marketing and distribution business. Weak localcurrencies limit the amount of U.S. dollar denominated products that we can import for ourinternational operations and limit our ability to be competitive against local producers selling inlocal currencies.OPERATING INTERNATIONALLY CARRIES RISKS AND UNCERTANTIES WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR RESULTSOF OPERATIONS.     We have our heaviest concentration of manufacturing facilities in the United States but alsohave significant facilities in Europe and Australia. Our marketing and trading offices are locatedin most major markets of the world and our suppliers and customers are located throughout theworld. Our marketing and distribution segment relies on substantial international shipments ofmaterials and products in the ordinary course of its business. Our stability, growth andprofitability are subject to a number of risks inherent in doing business internationally inaddition to the currency exchange risk discussed above, including:  political, military, terrorist or major pandemic events;   legal and regulatory requirements or limitations imposed by foreign governments(particularly those with significant steel consumption or steel related productionincluding China, Brazil, Russia and India) including quotas, tariffs or other protectionisttrade barriers, adverse tax law changes, nationalization or currency restrictions;   disruptions or delays in shipments caused by customs compliance or government agencies;and   potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations.These types of events may affect our ability to operate our business and could negatively affectour results of operations.16Table of ContentsWE RELY ON THE AVAILABILITY OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS FOR OUR MINIMILLOPERATIONS. DISRUPTIONS IN DELIVERY OR SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN ENERGY COSTS, INCLUDING CRUDE OILPRICES, COULD ADVERSLY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.     Minimills melt steel scrap in electric arc furnaces and use natural gas to heat steel billetsfor rolling into finished products. As large consumers of electricity and gas, often the largest inthe geographic area where our minimills are located, we must have dependable delivery ofelectricity and natural gas in order to operate. Accordingly, we are at risk in the event of anenergy disruption. Prolonged black-outs or brown-outs or disruptions caused by natural disasterssuch as hurricanes or by political considerations would substantially disrupt our production. Whilewe have not suffered prolonged production delays due to our inability to access electricity ornatural gas, several of our competitors have experienced such occurrences. Prolonged substantialincreases in energy costs would have an adverse effect on the costs of operating our minimills andwould negatively impact our gross margins unless we were able to fully pass through the additionalexpense to our customers. Our finished steel products are typically delivered by truck. Rapidincreases in the price of fuel attributable to increases in crude oil prices will increase ourcosts and adversely affect many of our customers financial results, which in turn could result inreduced margins and declining demand for our products. Rapid increases in fuel costs may alsonegatively impact our ability to charter ships for international deliveries at anticipated freightrates, thereby decreasing our margins on those transactions or causing our customers to look foralternative sources.OUR BUSINESS COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED AS A RESULT OF A THREATENED PROXY FIGHT AND OTHER ACTIONSOF ACTIVIST SHAREHOLDERSWe recently received a notice from an affiliate of Carl Icahn nominating three individuals forelection to our Board of Directors at the 2012 annual meeting, and proposing to present otherproposals for consideration by stockholders of the Company. If a proxy contest results from thisnotice, our business could be adversely affected because, among other things:  Responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders can be costlyand time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management andour employees;   Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potentialacquisitions, collaborations or other opportunities, and may make it more difficult toretain business partners; and   If individuals are elected to our board of directors with a specific agenda, it mayadversely affect our ability to effectively and timely implement our strategic plan.These actions could cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility.IF WE LOSE THE SERVICES OF KEY EMPLOYEES WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR OPERATIONSAND MEET OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES.     Our future success depends, in large part, on the continued service of our officers and otherkey employees and our ability to continue to attract and retain additional highly qualifiedpersonnel. These employees are integral to our success based on their expertise and knowledge ofour business and products. We compete for such personnel with other companies, including public andprivate company competitors who may periodically offer more favorable terms of employment. The lossor interruption of the services of a number of our key employees could reduce our ability toeffectively manage our operations due to the fact that we may not be able to find in a timelymanner, appropriate replacement personnel should the need arise.WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY COMPETING WITH COMPANIES THAT HAVE A LOWER COST STRUCTURE OR ACCESS TOGREATER FINANCIAL RESOURCES.17Table of Contents     We compete with regional, national and foreign manufacturers and traders. Consolidation amongparticipants in the steel manufacturing and recycling industries has resulted in fewer competitorsbut several which are significantly larger than us. Some of our larger competitors have greaterfinancial resources and more diverse businesses than us. Some of our foreign competitors may beable to pursue business opportunities without regard to certain of the laws and regulations withwhich we must comply, such as environmental regulations. These companies may have a lower coststructure, more operating flexibility and consequently they may be able to offer better prices andmore services than we can. There is no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully withthese companies. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business,financial condition or results of operations.OUR STEEL MINIMILL BUSINESS REQUIRES CONTINUOUS CAPITAL INVESTMENTS THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TOSUSTAIN.     We must make regular substantial capital investments in our steel minimills to lowerproduction costs and remain competitive. We cannot be certain that we will have sufficientinternally generated cash or acceptable external financing to make necessary substantial capitalexpenditures in the future. The availability of external financing depends on many factors outsideof our control, including capital market conditions and the overall performance of the economy. Iffunding is insufficient, we may be unable to develop or enhance our minimills, take advantage ofbusiness opportunities and respond to competitive pressures.SCRAP AND OTHER SUPPLIES FOR OUR BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT PRICE FLUCTUATIONS, WHICHMAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.     We depend on ferrous scrap, the primary feedstock for our steel minimills, and other suppliessuch as graphite electrodes and ferroalloys for our steel minimill operations. The price of scrapand other supplies have historically been subject to significant fluctuation, and we may not beable to adjust our product prices to recover the costs of rapid increases in material prices,especially over the short-term and in our domestic fabrication segments fixed price contracts.Our future profitability will be adversely affected if we are unable to pass on to our customersincreased raw material and supply costs.     The raw material used in manufacturing copper tubing is copper scrap, supplementedoccasionally by virgin copper ingot. Copper scrap is subject to rapid price fluctuations related tothe price and supply of virgin copper. Price increases for high quality copper scrap couldadversely affect our business. Our Arkansas mill does not have melting capacity, so it is dependenton an adequate supply of competitively priced used rail. The availability of used rail fluctuateswith the pace of railroad abandonments, rail replacement by railroads in the United States andabroad and demand for used rail from other domestic and foreign rail rerolling mills. Priceincreases for used rail could adversely affect our business.UNEXPECTED EQUIPMENT FAILURES MAY LEAD TO PRODUCTION CURTAILMENTS OR SHUTDOWNS.     Interruptions in our production capabilities would adversely affect our production costs,steel available for sales and earnings for the affected period. Our manufacturing processes aredependent upon critical pieces of steel-making equipment, such as our furnaces, continuous castersand rolling equipment, as well as electrical equipment, such as transformers. This equipment may,on occasion, be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures. We have experienced, and mayin the future experience, material plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result ofsuch equipment failures. In addition to equipment failures, our facilities are also subject to therisk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, explosions or violent weatherconditions.COMPETITION FROM OTHER MATERIALS MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIALCONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR PROSPECTS.     In many applications, steel competes with other materials, such as aluminum and plastics(particularly in the automobile industry), cement, composites, glass and wood. Increased use of oradditional substitutes for steel products could adversely affect future market prices and demandfor steel products.18Table of ContentsHEDGING TRANSACTIONS MAY EXPOSE US TO LOSSES OR LIMIT OUR POTENTIAL GAINS.     Our product lines and worldwide operations expose us to risks associated with fluctuations inforeign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. As part of our riskmanagement program, we use financial instruments, including commodity futures or forwards, foreigncurrency exchange forward contracts and interest rate swaps. While intended to reduce the effectsof the fluctuations, these transactions may limit our potential gains or expose us to losses.Should our counterparties to such transactions or the sponsors of the exchanges through which thesetransactions are offered, such as the London Metal Exchange, fail to honor their obligations due tofinancial distress we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipatedgains from these transactions.     We enter into the foreign currency exchange forwards as economic hedges of trade commitmentsor anticipated commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency to mitigatethe effects of changes in currency rates. These foreign exchange commitments are dependent ontimely performance by our counterparties. Their failure to perform could result in our having toclose these hedges without the anticipated underlying transaction and could result in losses ifforeign currency exchange rates have changed.WE ARE INVOLVED AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BECOME INVOLVED IN VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS THAT MAYRESULT IN FINES, PENALTIES OR JUDGMENTS BEING ASSESSED AGAINST US OR LIABILITY IMPOSED UPON USWHICH WE CANNOT PRESENTLY ESTIMATE OR REASONABLY FORESEE AND WHICH MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ONOUR EARNINGS (LOSS) AND CASH FLOWS.     Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, calledCERCLA or Superfund, or similar state statutes, we may have obligations to conduct investigationand remediation activities associated with alleged releases of hazardous substances or to reimbursethe EPA (or state agencies as applicable) for such activities and to pay for natural resourcedamages associated with alleged releases. We have been named a potentially responsible party atseveral Federal and state Superfund sites because the EPA or an equivalent state agency contendsthat we and other potentially responsible scrap metal suppliers are liable for the cleanup of thosesites as a result of having sold scrap metal to unrelated manufacturers for recycling as a rawmaterial in the manufacture of new products. We are involved in litigation or administrativeproceedings with regard to several of these sites in which we are contesting, or at the appropriatetime may contest, our liability at the sites. In addition, we have received information requestswith regard to other sites which may be under consideration by the EPA as potential CERCLA sites.     Although we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure to loss inconnection with various environmental matters or the effect on our consolidated financial position,we make accruals as warranted. Due to inherent uncertainties, including evolving remediationtechnology, changing regulations, possible third-party contributions, the inherent shortcomings ofthe estimation process, the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors, the amounts weaccrue could vary significantly from the amounts we ultimately are required to pay, which couldhave a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flow.WE ARE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY.     We are involved in various litigation matters, including regulatory proceedings,administrative proceedings, governmental investigations, environmental matters and constructioncontract disputes. The nature of our operations also exposes us to possible litigation claims inthe future. Because of the uncertain nature of litigation and coverage decisions, we cannot predictthe outcome of these matters. These matters could have a material adverse effect on our financialcondition and profitability. Litigation is very costly, and the costs associated with prosecutingand defending litigation matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditionand profitability. Although we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount ofexposure to loss in connection with litigation matters, we make accruals as warranted. However, theamounts that we accrue could vary significantly from the amounts we actually pay, due to inherentuncertainties and the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process, the uncertainties involvedin litigation and other factors.SOME OF OUR OPERATIONS PRESENT SIGNIFICANT RISK OF INJURY OR DEATH.19Table of Contents     The industrial activities conducted at our facilities present significant risk of seriousinjury or death to our employees, customers or other visitors to our operations, notwithstandingour safety precautions, including our material compliance with Federal, state and local employeehealth and safety regulations, and we may be unable to avoid material liabilities for an injury ordeath. We maintain workers compensation insurance to address the risk of incurring materialliabilities for injury or death, but there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage will beadequate or will continue to be available on the terms acceptable to us, or at all, which couldresult in material liabilities to us for an injury or death.OUR SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS MUST BE AUDITED ANNUALLY AND THE OCCURRENCE OF A MATERIAL WEAKNESSMAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS REPUTATION, CREDIT RATINGS AND PARTICIPATION IN CAPITAL MARKETS.     Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management must assess the design and functioning of oursystem of financial internal control. Our independent registered public accounting firm must thencertify the effectiveness of our internal controls. Discovery and disclosure of a materialweakness, by definition, may have a material adverse impact on our financial statements. Such anoccurrence may discourage certain customers or suppliers from doing business with us, may causedowngrades in our debt ratings leading to higher borrowing costs, and may affect how our stocktrades. This may in turn negatively affect our ability to access public debt or equity markets forcapital.HEALTH CARE LEGISLATION COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED COSTS AND NEGATIVELY AFFECT OURWORKFORCE.     Recently enacted health care mandates may cause us to evaluate the scope of health benefitsoffered to our workforce, the method in which they are delivered, and increase our and ouremployees costs. If we are not able to offer a competitive level of benefits, it may negativelyaffect the hiring and retention of qualified personnel. Higher health care costs may reduce ourearnings resulting in (i) an inability to reinvest sufficient capital in our operations, (ii) aninability to sustain dividends, (iii) lowered debt ratings and (iv) an increase in the cost ofcapital, all of which may have a negative effect on our share price"
0,CMC,COMMERCIAL METALS,2010-10-29,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS     Before making an investment in our company, you should be aware of various risks, includingthose described below. You should carefully consider these risk factors together with all of theother information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks described below are notthe only risks facing us. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition,results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected and you may lose all orpart of your investment.RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRYOUR INDUSTRY IS AFFECTED BY GLOBAL ECONOMIC FACTORS INCLUDING THE RISK OF A RECESSION AND OURCUSTOMERS ACCESS TO CREDIT FACILITIES.     Our financial results are substantially dependent upon the overall economic conditions in theUnited States and the European Union. A continued recession in the United States, the EuropeanUnion, or globally  or the public perception that a recession is continuing  could furthersubstantially decrease the demand for our products and adversely affect our business. Many of ourproducts are commodities subject to cyclical fluctuations in supply and demand in metal consumingindustries and construction. Metals industries have historically been vulnerable to significantdeclines in consumption and product pricing during prolonged periods of economic downturn. Likewisethe pace of construction has historically slowed significantly during economic downturns. Many ofour customers rely on access to credit to adequately fund their operations or to financeconstruction projects. The inability of our customers to access credit facilities will adverselyaffect our business by reducing our sales, increasing our exposure to accounts receivable,increasing our bad debts and reducing our profitability. Our geographic concentration in thesouthern and southwestern United States as well as Central Europe, Australia, China, and the MiddleEast exposes us to the local market conditions in these regions. Economic downturns in these areasor decisions by governments that have an impact on the level and pace of overall economic activityin a particular region could also adversely affect our sales and profitability.OUR INDUSTRY IS CYCLICAL AND PROLONGED ECONOMIC DECLINES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ONOUR BUSINESS.     Our business supports cyclical industries such as commercial, residential and governmentconstruction, energy, metals service center, petrochemical and original equipment manufacturing.These industries may experience significant fluctuations in demand for our products based oneconomic conditions, energy prices, consumer demand and decisions by governments to fundinfrastructure projects such as highways, schools, energy plants and airports. Many of thesefactors are beyond our control. As a result of the volatility in the industries we serve, we mayhave difficulty increasing or maintaining our level of sales or profitability. If the industries weserve suffer a prolonged downturn, then our business may be adversely affected. Although theresidential housing market is not a significant direct factor in our business, related commercialand infrastructure construction activities, such as shopping centers, schools and roads could beimpacted by a prolonged slump in new housing construction.     Our industry is characterized by low backlogs, which means that our results of operations arepromptly affected by short-term economic fluctuations.A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN CHINAS STEEL CONSUMPTION OR INCREASED CHINESE STEEL PRODUCTIONSUBSTANTIALLY EXCEEDING LOCAL DEMAND MAY RESULT IN CHINA BECOMING A LARGE EXPORTER OF STEEL ANDDISRUPTION TO WORLD STEEL MARKETS.     Chinese economic expansion has affected the availability and heightened the volatility of manycommodities that we market and use in our manufacturing process, including steel. Expansions andcontractions in Chinas economy can have major effects on the price of our finished steel productsand many commodities that affect us such as secondary metals, energy, marine freight rates, steelmaking supplies such as ferroalloys and graphite electrodes and materials we market such as ironore and coke. Should Chinese demand weaken or Chinese steel production be allowed to expandunchecked to the point that it significantly exceeds the countrys consumption, prices for many ofthe products that we both sell to and export from China may fall causing erosion in our grossmargins and subjecting us to possible renegotiation of contracts or increases in bad debts.Significant exports from China of steel in the product lines we manufacture would cause sellingprices to decline and negatively impact our volumes and gross margins.12Table of ContentsRAPID AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF METALS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR INDUSTRY.     Prices for most metals in which we deal have experienced increased volatility over the lastseveral years and the substantial rapid decreases or increases impact us in several ways. Some ofour operations, such as, the fabrication operations, may benefit from rapidly decreasing steelprices as their material cost for previously contracted fixed price work declines. Others, such asour Americas Mills and International Mills segments, would likely experience reduced margins andmay be forced to liquidate high cost inventory at reduced margins or losses until pricesstabilized. Sudden increases could have the opposite effect. Overall, we believe that rapidsubstantial price changes are not to our industrys benefit. Our customer and supplier base wouldbe impacted due to uncertainty as to future prices. A reluctance to purchase inventory in the faceof extreme price decreases or to sell quickly during a period of rapid price increases would likelyreduce our volume of business. Marginal industry participants or speculators may attempt toparticipate to an unhealthy extent during a period of rapid price escalation with a substantialrisk of contract default should prices suddenly reverse. Risks of default in contract performanceby customers or suppliers as well as an increased risk of bad debts and customer credit exposurewould increase during periods of rapid and substantial price changes.EXCESS CAPACITY IN OUR INDUSTRY COULD INCREASE THE LEVEL OF STEEL IMPORTS INTO THE UNITED STATESRESULTING IN LOWER DOMESTIC PRICES WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SALES, MARGINS ANDPROFITABILITY.     Steel-making capacity exceeds demand for steel products in some countries. Rather thanreducing employment by rationalizing capacity with consumption, steel manufacturers in thesecountries (often with local government assistance or subsidies in various forms) have traditionallyperiodically exported steel at prices significantly below their home market prices and which maynot reflect their costs of production or capital. This supply of imports can decrease thesensitivity of domestic steel prices to increases in demand or decrease our ability to recover ourmanufacturing costs. The excess capacity may create downward pressure on our steel prices whichcould adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability.COMPLIANCE WITH AND CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND REMEDIATION REQUIREMENTS COULD RESULT INSUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OPERATING COSTS.     Existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, orfuture laws or regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations andfinancial condition. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is a significant factor inour business. We are subject to local, state, Federal and international environmental laws andregulations concerning, among other matters, waste disposal, air emissions, waste and storm watereffluent and disposal and employee health. New facilities that we may build, especially steelminimills, are required to obtain several environmental permits before significant construction orcommencement of operations. Delays in obtaining permits or unanticipated conditions in such permitscould delay the project or increase construction costs or operating expenses. Our manufacturing andrecycling operations produce significant amounts of by-products, some of which are handled asindustrial waste or hazardous waste. For example, our minimills generate electric arc furnace dust(EAF dust), which the EPA and other regulatory authorities classify as hazardous waste. EAF dustrequires special handling, recycling or disposal.     In addition, the primary feed materials for the shredders operated by our scrap metalrecycling facilities are automobile hulks and obsolete household appliances. Approximately 20% ofthe weight of an automobile hull consists of unrecyclable material known as shredder fluff. Afterthe segregation of ferrous and saleable nonferrous metals, shredder fluff remains. We, along withothers in the recycling industry, interpret Federal regulations to require shredder fluff to meetcertain criteria and pass a toxic leaching test to avoid classification as a hazardous waste. Wealso endeavor to remove hazardous contaminants from the feed material prior to shredding. As aresult, we believe the shredder fluff we generate is not normally considered or properly classifiedas hazardous waste. If the laws, regulations or testing methods change with regard to EAF dust orshredder fluff or other by-products, we may incur additional significant expenditures.13Table of Contents     Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws andregulations, legal requirements are changing frequently and are subject to interpretation. Newlaws, regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities, together with uncertaintyregarding adequate pollution control levels, testing and sampling procedures, new pollution controltechnology and cost benefit analysis based on market conditions are all factors that may increaseour future expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. Accordingly, we are unable topredict the ultimate cost of future compliance with these requirements or their effect on ouroperations. We cannot predict whether such costs can be passed on to customers through productprice increases. Competitors in various regions or countries where environmental regulation mightnot be so restrictive, subject to different interpretation or generally not enforced, may enjoy acompetitive advantage.     We may also be required to conduct additional clean up at sites where we have alreadyparticipated in remediation efforts or to take remediation action with regard to sites formerlyused in connection with our operations. We may be required to pay for a portion or all of the costsof clean up or remediation at sites we never owned or on which we never operated if we are found tohave arranged for treatment or disposal of hazardous substances on the sites. In cases of joint andseveral liability, we may be obligated to pay a disproportionate share of cleanup costs if otherresponsible parties are financially insolvent.INCREASED REGULATION ASSOCIATED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS COULD IMPOSESIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL COSTS ON BOTH OUR STEELMAKING AND METALS RECYCLING OPERATIONS.     The U.S. government and various governmental agencies have introduced or are contemplatingregulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change. International treatiesor agreements may also result in increasing regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, including theintroduction of carbon emissions trading mechanisms. Any such regulation regarding climate changeand greenhouse gas, or GHG emissions could impose significant costs on our steelmaking and metalsrecycling operations and on the operations of our customers and suppliers, including increasedenergy, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs in order tocomply with current or future laws or regulations concerning and limitations imposed on ouroperations by virtue of climate change and GHG emissions laws and regulations. The potential costsof allowances, offsets or credits that may be part of potential cap-and-trade programs orsimilar future regulatory measures are still uncertain. Any adopted future climate change and GHGregulations could negatively impact our ability (and that of our customers and suppliers) tocompete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. From a medium andlong-term perspective, we may see an increase in costs relating to our assets that emit significantamounts of greenhouse gases as a result of these regulatory initiatives. These regulatoryinitiatives will be either voluntary or mandatory and may impact our operations directly or throughour suppliers or customers. Until the timing, scope and extent of any future regulation becomesknown, we cannot predict the effect on our financial condition, operating performance and abilityto compete.RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMPANYPOTENTIAL LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS CREDIT FACILITIES MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OURBUSINESS.     Although we believe we have adequate access to several sources of contractually committedborrowings and other available credit facilities (see the discussion at page 37 of our liquidity),we could be adversely affected if our banks, the buyers of our commercial paper or other of thetraditional sources supplying our short term borrowing requirements refused to honor their contractcommitments or ceased lending. While we believe the lending institutions participating in ourcredit arrangements are financially capable, events in the global credit markets, including thefailure, takeover or rescue by various government entities of major financial institutions, havecreated uncertainty of credit availability to an extent not experienced in recent decades. Ourcommercial paper program is ranked in the third highest category by Moodys Investors Service (P-3)and by Standard & Poors Corporation (A-3). Our senior unsecured debt is investment grade rated byStandard & Poors Corporation (BBB-) and Moodys Investors Service (Baa3). In determining ourcredit ratings, the rating agencies consider a number of both quantitative and qualitative factors.These factors include earnings, fixed charges such as interest, cash flows, total14Table of Contentsdebt outstanding, off balance sheet obligations and other commitments, total capitalizationand various ratios calculated from these factors. The rating agencies also consider predictabilityof cash flows, business strategy and diversity, industry conditions and contingencies. Lowerratings on our commercial paper program or our senior unsecured debt could impair our ability toobtain additional financing and will increase the cost of the financing that we do obtain.SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS MAY DEFAULT ON THE DEBTS THEY OWE TO US.     Should the recent constraints on access to credit continue for a prolonged period some of ourcustomers may struggle or fail to meet their obligations, especially if they in turn experiencedefaults on receivables due from their customers. A continued recession could result in ourincurring bad debt costs in excess of our expectations and prior experience. In certain markets wehave experienced a consolidation among those entities to whom we sell. This consolidation, alongwith higher metals and other commodity prices, has resulted in an increased credit risk spreadamong fewer customers often without a corresponding strengthening of their financial status. Wehave expanded our use of credit insurance for accounts receivable in our businesses. While webelieve the insurance companies with whom our accounts receivable are insured are capable ofmeeting their contract obligations, it is possible that we may not be capable of recovering all ofour insured losses should they experience significant losses threatening their viability.Additionally, credit insurance policies typically have relatively short policy periods and requirepre-approval of customers with maximum insured limits established by customer. Should creditinsurers incur large losses, the insurance may be more difficult to secure and when availablelikely only at increased costs with decreased coverage. While in many international salestransactions we require letters of credit from financial institutions which we believe to befinancially secure, we may be at risk in the event the financial institution subsequently fails andthe customer is unable to pay for the products we sold. A significant amount of our accountsreceivable are considered to be open account uninsured accounts receivable. We regularly maintain asubstantial amount of accounts receivable, at year end $824 million. During the fiscal year, we hadnet reductions to bad debt expense of $2.6 million, charged off accounts receivable of $11.6million and had recoveries of $1.8 million and at year end our allowance for doubtful accounts wasapproximately $30 million.POTENTIAL IMPACT OF OUR CUSTOMERS NON-COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING COMMERCIAL CONTRACTS ANDCOMMITMENTS.     Most consumers of the metals products we sell have been negatively impacted by the recession.Many of our customers have experienced reductions, some substantial, in their operations. Pricesfor many of the metals products we sell have declined, some substantially. These factors havecontributed to attempts by some customers to seek renegotiation or cancellation of their existingpurchase commitments. Some of our customers have breached previously agreed upon contracts to buyour products by refusing delivery of the products. Where appropriate we have and will in the futurepursue litigation to recover our damages resulting from customer contract defaults. A large numberof our customers defaulting on existing contractual obligations to purchase our products would havea material impact on our results of operations.THE AGREEMENTS GOVERNING THE NOTES AND OUR OTHER DEBT CONTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS AND IMPOSERESTRICTIONS ON OUR BUSINESS.     The indenture governing our 5.625% notes due 2013, 6.50% notes due 2017 and 7.35% notes due2018 contains restrictions on our ability to create liens, sell assets, enter into sale andleaseback transactions and consolidate or merge. In addition, our credit facility containscovenants that place restrictions on our ability to, among other things:  create liens;   enter into transactions with affiliates;   sell assets;   in the case of some of our subsidiaries, guarantee debt; and   consolidate or merge.15Table of Contents     Our credit facility also requires that we meet certain financial tests and maintain certainfinancial ratios, including a maximum debt to capitalization and interest coverage ratios and aminimum liquidity requirement.     Other agreements that we may enter into in the future may contain covenants imposingsignificant restrictions on our business that are similar to, or in addition to, the covenantsunder our existing agreements. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our businessand may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.     Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control,including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. The breach of any of theserestrictions could result in a default under the indenture governing the notes or under our otherdebt agreements. An event of default under our debt agreements would permit some of our lenders todeclare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaidinterest. If we were unable to repay debt to our secured lenders or if we incur secured debt in thefuture, these lenders could proceed against the collateral securing that debt. In addition,acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on thenotes.FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR RELATIVE TO OTHER CURRENCIES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OURBUSINESS.     Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar can be expected to affect our business. Inparticular major changes in the rate of exchange of Chinas renminbi or the value of the euro tothe U.S. dollar could negatively impact our business. A strong U.S. dollar makes imported metalproducts less expensive, resulting in more imports of steel products into the United States by ourforeign competitors while a weak U.S. dollar may have the opposite impact on imports. With theexception of exports of nonferrous scrap metal by our Americas Recycling segment we have notrecently been a significant exporter of metal products from our United States operations. Economicdifficulties in some large steel producing regions of the world resulting in lower local demand forsteel products have historically encouraged greater steel exports to the United States at depressedprices which can be exacerbated by a strong dollar. As a result, our products which are made in theUnited States may become relatively more expensive as compared to imported steel, which has had andin the future could have a negative impact on our sales, revenues, profitability and cash flows.     A strong U.S. dollar hampers our international marketing and distribution business. Weak localcurrencies limit the amount of U.S. dollar denominated products that we can import for ourinternational operations and limit our ability to be competitive against local producers selling inlocal currencies.OPERATING INTERNATIONALLY CARRIES RISKS AND UNCERTANTIES WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR RESULTSOF OPERATIONS.     We have our heaviest concentration of manufacturing facilities in the United States but alsohave significant facilities in Europe and Australia. Our marketing and trading offices are locatedin most major markets of the world with our suppliers and our customers located throughout theworld. Our marketing and distribution segment relies on substantial international shipments ofmaterials and products in the ordinary course of its business. Our stability, growth andprofitability are subject to a number of risks inherent in doing business internationally inaddition to the currency exchange risk discussed above, including:  political, military, terrorist or major pandemic events;   legal and regulatory requirements or limitations imposed by foreign governments(particularly those with significant steel consumption or steel related productionincluding China, Brazil, Russia and India) including quotas, tariffs or other protectionisttrade barriers, adverse tax law changes, nationalization or currency restrictions;   disruptions or delays in shipments caused by customs compliance or government agencies;and   potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations.These types of events may affect our ability to operate our business and could negatively affectour results of operations.16Table of ContentsWE RELY ON THE AVAILABILITY OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS FOR OUR MINIMILLOPERATIONS. DISRUPTIONS IN DELIVERY OR SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN ENERGY COSTS, INCLUDING CRUDE OILPRICES, COULD ADVERSLY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.     Minimills melt steel scrap in electric arc furnaces and use natural gas to heat steel billetsfor rolling into finished products. As large consumers of electricity and gas, often the largest inthe geographic area where our minimills are located, we must have dependable delivery ofelectricity and natural gas in order to operate. Accordingly, we are at risk in the event of anenergy disruption. Prolonged black-outs or brown-outs or disruptions caused by natural disasterssuch as hurricanes or by political considerations would substantially disrupt our production. Whilewe have not suffered prolonged production delays due to our inability to access electricity ornatural gas several of our competitors have experienced such occurrences. Prolonged substantialincreases in energy costs would have an adverse effect on the costs of operating our minimills andwould negatively impact our gross margins unless we were able to fully pass through the additionalexpense. Our finished steel products are typically delivered by truck. Rapid increases in the priceof fuel attributable to increases in crude oil prices will have a negative impact on our costs andmany of our customers financial results which could result in reduced margins and declining demandfor our products. Rapid increases in fuel costs may also negatively impact our ability to charterships for international deliveries at anticipated freight rates thereby decreasing our margins onthose transactions or causing our customers to look for alternative sources.IF WE LOSE THE SERVICES OF KEY EMPLOYEES WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR OPERATIONSAND MEET OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES.     Our future success depends, in large part, on the continued service of our officers and otherkey employees and our ability to continue to attract and retain additional highly qualifiedpersonnel. These employees are integral to our success based on their expertise and knowledge ofour business and products. We compete for such personnel with other companies including public andprivate company competitors who may periodically offer more favorable terms of employment. The lossor interruption of the services of a number of our key employees could reduce our ability toeffectively manage our operations due to the fact that we may not be able to find in a timelymanner, appropriate replacement personnel should the need arise.WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY COMPETING WITH COMPANIES THAT HAVE A LOWER COST STRUCTURE OR ACCESS TOGREATER FINANCIAL RESOURCES.     We compete with regional, national and foreign manufacturers and traders. Consolidation amongparticipants in the steel manufacturing and recycling industries has resulted in fewer competitorsbut several which are significantly larger. Some of our larger competitors have greater financialresources and more diverse businesses than us. Some of our foreign competitors may be able topursue business opportunities without regard for the laws and regulations with which we mustcomply, such as environmental regulations. These companies may have a lower cost structure, moreoperating flexibility and consequently they may be able to offer better prices and more servicesthan we can. There is no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with thesecompanies. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition or results of operations.OUR STEEL MINIMILL BUSINESS REQUIRES CONTINUOUS CAPITAL INVESTMENTS THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TOSUSTAIN.     We must make regular substantial capital investments in our steel minimills to lowerproduction costs and remain competitive. We cannot be certain that we will have sufficientinternally generated cash or acceptable external financing to make necessary substantial capitalexpenditures in the future. The availability of external financing depends on many factors outsideof our control, including capital market conditions and the overall performance of the economy. Iffunding is insufficient, we may be unable to develop or enhance our minimills, take advantage ofbusiness opportunities and respond to competitive pressures.SCRAP AND OTHER SUPPLIES FOR OUR BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT PRICE FLUCTUATIONS, WHICHMAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.17Table of Contents     We depend on ferrous scrap, the primary feedstock for our steel minimills and other suppliessuch as graphiteelectrodes and ferroalloys for our steel minimill operations. Although we believe that thesupply of scrap is adequate to meet future needs, the price of scrap and other supplies hashistorically been subject to significant fluctuation. Our future profitability will be adverselyaffected if we are unable to pass on to our customers increased raw material and supply costs. Wemay not be able to adjust our product prices to recover the costs of rapid increases in materialprices, especially over the short-term and in our domestic fabrication segments fixed pricefabrication contracts.     The raw material used in manufacturing copper tubing is copper scrap, supplementedoccasionally by virgin copper ingot. Copper scrap has generally been readily available, and a smallportion of our copper scrap comes from our metal recycling yards. However, copper scrap is subjectto rapid price fluctuations related to the price and supply of virgin copper. Price increases forhigh quality copper scrap could adversely affect our business. Our Arkansas mill does not havemelting capacity, so it is dependent on an adequate supply of competitively priced used rail. Theavailability of used rail fluctuates with the pace of railroad abandonments, rail replacement byrailroads in the United States and abroad and demand for used rail from other domestic and foreignrail rerolling mills. Price increases for used rail could adversely affect our business.UNEXPECTED EQUIPMENT FAILURES MAY LEAD TO PRODUCTION CURTAILMENTS OR SHUTDOWNS.     Interruptions in our production capabilities will adversely affect our production costs, steelavailable for sales and earnings for the affected period. In addition to equipment failures, ourfacilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such asfires, explosions or violent weather conditions. Our manufacturing processes are dependent uponcritical pieces of steel-making equipment, such as our furnaces, continuous casters and rollingequipment, as well as electrical equipment, such as transformers. This equipment may, on occasion,be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures. We have experienced and may in the futureexperience material plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such equipmentfailures.COMPETITION FROM OTHER MATERIALS MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIALCONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR PROSPECTS.     In many applications, steel competes with other materials, such as aluminum and plastics(particularly in the automobile industry), cement, composites, glass and wood. Increased use of oradditional substitutes for steel products could adversely affect future market prices and demandfor steel products.HEDGING TRANSACTIONS MAY EXPOSE US TO LOSS OR LIMIT OUR POTENTIAL GAINS.     Our product lines and worldwide operations expose us to risks associated with fluctuations inforeign currency exchange, commodity prices and interest rates. As part of our risk managementprogram, we use financial instruments, including commodity futures or forwards, foreign currencyexchange forward contracts and interest rate swaps. While intended to reduce the effects of thefluctuations, these transactions may limit our potential gains or expose us to loss. Should ourcounterparties to such transactions or the sponsors of the exchanges through which thesetransactions are offered, such as the London Metal Exchange, fail to honor their obligations due tofinancial distress we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipatedgains from these transactions.     We enter into the foreign currency exchange forwards as economic hedges of trade commitmentsor anticipated commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency to mitigatethe effects of changes in currency rates. Although we do not enter into these instruments fortrading purposes or speculation, and although our management believes all of these instruments areeconomically effective as hedges of underlying physical transactions, these foreign exchangecommitments are dependent on timely performance by our counterparties. Their failure to performcould result in our having to close these hedges without the anticipated underlying transaction andcould result in losses if foreign currency exchange rates have changed.18Table of ContentsWE ARE INVOLVED AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BECOME INVOLVED IN VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS THAT MAYRESULT IN FINES, PENALTIES OR JUDGMENTS BEING ASSESSED AGAINST US OR LIABILITY IMPOSED UPON USWHICH WE CANNOT PRESENTLY ESTIMATE OR REASONABLY FORESEE AND WHICH MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ONOUR EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS.     Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, calledCERCLA or Superfund, or similar state statutes, we may have obligations to conduct investigationand remediation activities associated with alleged releases of hazardous substances or to reimbursethe EPA (or state agencies as applicable) for such activities and to pay for natural resourcedamages associated with alleged releases. We have been named a potentially responsible party atseveral Federal and state Superfund sites because the EPA or an equivalent state agency contendsthat we and other potentially responsible scrap metal suppliers are liable for the cleanup of thosesites as a result of having sold scrap metal to unrelated manufacturers for recycling as a rawmaterial in the manufacture of new products. We are involved in litigation or administrativeproceedings with regard to several of these sites in which we are contesting, or at the appropriatetime may contest, our liability at the sites. In addition, we have received information requestswith regard to other sites which may be under consideration by the EPA as potential CERCLA sites.     Although we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure to loss inconnection with various environmental matters or the effect on our consolidated financial position,we make accruals as warranted. Due to inherent uncertainties, including evolving remediationtechnology, changing regulations, possible third-party contributions, the inherent shortcomings ofthe estimation process, the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors, the amounts weaccrue could vary significantly from the amounts we ultimately are required to pay, which couldhave a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flow.WE ARE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY.     We are involved in various litigation matters, including regulatory proceedings,administrative proceedings, governmental investigations, environmental matters and constructioncontract disputes. The nature of our operations also exposes us to possible litigation claims inthe future. Although we make every effort to avoid litigation, these matters are not totally withinour control. We will contest these matters vigorously and have made insurance claims whereappropriate, but because of the uncertain nature of litigation and coverage decisions, we cannotpredict the outcome of these matters. These matters could have a material adverse affect on ourfinancial condition and profitability. Litigation is very costly, and the costs associated withprosecuting and defending litigation matters could have a material adverse effect on our financialcondition and profitability. Although we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollaramount of exposure to loss in connection with litigation matters, we make accruals as warranted.However, the amounts that we accrue could vary significantly from the amounts we actually pay, dueto inherent uncertainties and the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process, theuncertainties involved in litigation and other factors.SOME OF OUR OPERATIONS PRESENT SIGNIFICANT RISK OF INJURY OR DEATH.     The industrial activities conducted at our facilities present significant risk of seriousinjury or death to our employees, customers or other visitors to our operations, notwithstandingour safety precautions, including our material compliance with Federal, state and local employeehealth and safety regulations. While we have in place policies and procedures to minimize suchrisks, we may nevertheless be unable to avoid material liabilities for an injury or death. Eventhough we maintain workers compensation insurance to address the risk of incurring materialliabilities for injury or death, there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage will beadequate or will continue to be available on the terms acceptable to us, or at all, which couldresult in material liabilities to us for an injury or death.19Table of ContentsOUR SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS MUST BE AUDITED ANNUALLY AND THE OCCURRENCE OF A MATERIAL WEAKNESSMAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS REPUTATION, CREDIT RATINGS AND PARTICIPATION IN CAPITAL MARKETS.     Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, management must assess the design and functioning of our systemof financial internal control. Our independent registered public accounting firm must then certifythe effectiveness of our internal controls. Discovery and disclosure of a material weakness, bydefinition, may have a material adverse impact on our financial statements. Such an occurrence maydiscourage certain customers or suppliers from doing business with us, may cause downgrades in ourdebt ratings leading to higher borrowing costs, and may affect how our stock trades. This may inturn negatively affect our ability to access public debt or equity markets for capital.HEALTH CARE LEGISLATION COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED COSTS AND NEGATIVELY AFFECT OURWORKFORCE.     Recently enacted health care mandates may cause us to evaluate the scope of health benefitsoffered to our workforce, the method in which they are delivered, and increase our and ouremployees costs. If we are not able to offer a competitive level of benefits, it may negativelyaffect the hiring and retention of qualified personnel. Higher health care costs may reduce ourearnings resulting in (i) an inability to reinvest sufficient capital in our operations, (ii) an inability to sustaindividends, (iii) lowered debt ratings and (iv) an increase in the cost of capital, all of which may have a negative effect on ourshare price"

You should carefully consider these risk factors together with all of theother information included in this annual report on Form 10-K. The risks described below are notthe only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently deem to be immaterialmay also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition,results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected and you may lose all orpart of your investment.RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRYOUR INDUSTRY IS AFFECTED BY CYCLICAL AND GLOBAL ECONOMIC FACTORS INCLUDING THE RISK OF A RECESSIONAND OUR CUSTOMERS ACCESS TO CREDIT FACILITIES.     Our financial results are substantially dependent upon the overall economic conditions in theUnited States and the European Union. A continued recession in the United States, the EuropeanUnion, or globally  or the public perception that a recession is continuing  couldsubstantially decrease the demand for our products and adversely affect our business. Many of ourproducts are commodities subject to cyclical fluctuations in supply and demand in metal consumingindustries and construction. Metals industries have historically been vulnerable to significantdeclines in consumption and product pricing during prolong periods of economic downturn. Likewisethe pace of construction has historically slowed significantly during economic downturns. Many ofour customers rely on access to credit to adequately fund their operations or to financeconstruction projects. The inability of our customers to access credit facilities will adverselyaffect our business by reducing our sales, increasing our exposure to accounts receivable bad debtsand reducing our profitability. Our geographic concentration in the southern and southwesternUnited States as well as Central Europe, Australia, China, and the Middle East exposes us to thelocal market conditions in these regions. Economic downturns in these areas or decisions bygovernments that have an impact on the level and pace of overall economic activity in a particularregion could also adversely affect our sales and profitability.     Our business supports cyclical industries such as commercial, residential and governmentconstruction, energy, metals service center, petrochemical and original equipment manufacturing.These industries may experience significant fluctuations in demand for our products based oneconomic conditions, energy prices, consumer demand and decisions by governments to fundinfrastructure projects such as highways, schools, energy plants and airports. Many of thesefactors are beyond our control. As a result of the volatility in the industries we serve, we mayhave difficulty increasing or maintaining our level of sales or profitability. If the industries weserve suffer a prolonged downturn, then our business may be adversely affected. Although theresidential housing market is not a significant direct factor in our business, related commercialand infrastructure construction activities, such as shopping centers and roads could be impacted bya prolonged slump in new housing construction.     Our industry is characterized by low backlogs, which means that our results of operations arepromptly affected by short-term economic fluctuations.A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN CHINAS STEEL CONSUMPTION OR INCREASED CHINESE STEEL PRODUCTIONSUBSTANTIALLY EXCEEDING LOCAL DEMAND MAY RESULT IN CHINA BECOMING A LARGE EXPORTER OF STEEL ANDDISRUPTION TO WORLD STEEL MARKETS.     Chinese economic expansion has affected the availability and heightened the volatility of manycommodities that we market and use in our manufacturing process, including steel. It is reportedthat in calendar year 2008 China produced approximately 510 million metric tons of crude steel,representing 38% of world production. Chinas estimated consumption was approximately 448 millionmetric tons and was a net exporter of approximately 52 million tons in 2008. Expansions andcontractions in Chinas economy can have major effects on the pricing of not only the price of ourfinished steel products but also many commodities that affect us such as secondary metals, energy,marine freight rates, steel making supplies such as ferroalloys and graphite electrodes andmaterials we12Table of Contentsmarket such as iron ore and coke. Should Chinese demand weaken or Chinese steel production beallowed to expand unchecked to the point that it significantly exceeds the countrys consumption,prices for many of the products that we both sell to and export from China may fall causing erosionin our gross margins and subjecting us to possible renegotiation of contracts or increases in baddebts. Significant exports from China of steel in the product lines we manufacture would causeselling prices to decline and negatively impact our gross margins.RAPID AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF METALS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR INDUSTRY.     Prices for most metals in which we deal have experienced increased volatility over the lastseveral years. More recently steel prices sharply declined from their peaks and are at stillrelatively low levels.. However, should metals prices experience further substantial rapiddecreases or increases it would impact us in several ways. Some of our operations, the fabricationoperations for example, may benefit from rapidly decreasing steel prices as their material cost forpreviously contracted fixed price work declines. Others, such as our Americas Mills andInternational Mills segments, would likely experience reduced margins and may be forced toliquidate high cost inventory at reduced margins or losses until prices stabilized. Suddenincreases could have the opposite effect. Overall, we believe that rapid substantial price changes,would not be to our industrys benefit. Our customer and supplier base would be impacted due touncertainty as to future prices. A reluctance to purchase inventory in the face of extreme pricedecreases or sell quickly during a period of rapid price increases would likely reduce our volumeof business. Marginal industry participants or speculators may attempt to participate to anunhealthy extent during a period of rapid price escalation with a substantial risk of contractdefault should prices suddenly reverse. Risks of default in contract performance by customers orsuppliers as well as an increased risk of bad debts and customer credit exposure would increaseduring periods of rapid and substantial price changes.EXCESS CAPACITY IN OUR INDUSTRY COULD INCREASE THE LEVEL OF STEEL IMPORTS INTO THE UNITED STATESRESULTING IN LOWER DOMESTIC PRICES WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SALES, MARGINS ANDPROFITABILITY.     Steel-making capacity exceeds demand for steel products in some countries. Rather thanreducing employment by rationalizing capacity with consumption, steel manufacturers in thesecountries (often with local government assistance or subsidies in various forms) have traditionallyperiodically exported steel at prices significantly below their home market prices and which maynot reflect their costs of production or capital. This supply of imports can decrease thesensitivity of domestic steel prices to increases in demand or our ability to recover increasedmanufacturing costs.COMPLIANCE WITH AND CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND REMEDIATION REQUIREMENTS COULD RESULT INSUSTANTIALLY INCREASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OPERATING COSTS.     Existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, orfuture laws or regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations andfinancial condition. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is a significant factor inour business. We are subject to local, state, federal and international environmental laws andregulations concerning, among other matters, waste disposal, air emissions, waste and storm watereffluent and disposal and employee health. New facilities that we may build, especially steelminimills, are required to obtain several environmental permits before significant construction orcommencement of operations. Delays in obtaining permits or unanticipated conditions in such permitscould delay the project or increase construction costs or operating expenses. Our manufacturing andrecycling operations produce significant amounts of by-products, some of which are handled asindustrial waste or hazardous waste. For example, our minimills generate electric arc furnace dust(EAF dust), which the EPA and other regulatory authorities classify as hazardous waste. EAF dustrequires special handling, recycling or disposal.     In addition, the primary feed materials for the shredders operated by our scrap metalrecycling facilities are automobile hulks and obsolete household appliances. Approximately 20% ofthe weight of an automobile hull consists of unrecyclable material known as shredder fluff. Afterthe segregation of ferrous and saleable non-ferrous metals, shredder fluff remains. We, along withothers in the recycling industry, interpret Federal regulations to require shredder fluff to meetcertain criteria and pass a toxic leaching test to avoid classification as a hazardous waste. Wealso endeavor to remove hazardous contaminants from the feed material prior to shredding. As aresult, we believe the shredder fluff we generate is not normally considered or properly classifiedas hazardous waste. If the laws, regulations or testing methods change with regard to EAF dust orshredder fluff, we may incur additional significant expenditures.13Table of Contents     Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws andregulations, legal requirements are changing frequently and are subject to interpretation. Newlaws, regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities, together with uncertaintyregarding adequate pollution control levels, testing and sampling procedures, new pollution controltechnology and cost benefit analysis based on market conditions are all factors that may increaseour future expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. Accordingly, we are unable topredict the ultimate cost of future compliance with these requirements or their effect on ouroperations. We cannot predict whether such costs can be passed on to customers through productprice increases. Competitors in various regions or countries where environmental regulation mightnot be so restrictive, subject to different interpretation or generally not enforced, may enjoy acompetitive advantage.     We may also be required to conduct additional clean up at sites where we have alreadyparticipated in remediation efforts or to take remediation action with regard to sites formerlyused in connection with our operations. We may be required to pay for a portion of the costs ofclean up or remediation at sites we never owned or on which we never operated if we are found tohave arranged for treatment or disposal of hazardous substances on the sites. In cases of jointand several liability, we may be obligated to pay a disproportionate share of cleanup costs ifother responsible parties are financially insolvent.RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMPANYPOTENTIAL LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS CREDIT FACILITIES MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OURBUSINESS.     Although we believe we have adequate access to several sources of contractually committedborrowings and other available credit facilities (see the discussionat page 36 of our liquidity),we could be adversely affected if our banks, the buyers of our commercial paper or other of thetraditional sources supplying our short term borrowing requirements refused to honor their contractcommitments or ceased lending. While we believe the lending institutions participating in ourcredit arrangements are financially capable, recent events in the global credit markets, includingthe failure, takeover or rescue by various government entities of major financial institutions,have created uncertainty of credit availability to an extent not experienced in recent decades. Ourcommercial paper program is ranked in the second highest category by Moodys Investors Service(P-2) and the third highest by Standard & Poors Corporation (A-3). Our senior unsecured debt isinvestment grade rated by Standard & Poors Corporation (BBB) and Moodys Investors Service (Baa2).In determining our credit ratings, the rating agencies consider a number of both quantitative andqualitative factors. These factors include earnings, fixed charges such as interest, cash flows,total debt outstanding, off balance sheet obligations and other commitments, total capitalizationand various ratios calculated from these factors. The rating agencies also consider predictabilityof cash flows, business strategy and diversity, industry conditions and contingencies. Lowerratings on our commercial paper program or our senior unsecured debt could impair our ability toobtain additional financing and will increase the cost of the financing that we do obtain.WE HAVE INITIATED IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING SYSTEM WHICH, IF NOTEFFECTIVELY MANAGED AND CONTROLLED, COULD THREATEN THE ACHIEVEMENT OF OPERATION AND FINANCIALGOALS.     In 2006 we began planning and design of a new enterprise resource planning system whichcontinued through 2007 with phased implementation during 2008 and 2009 and currently scheduled tocontinue through the next several years. There are risks that the effort may not result in asuccessful implementation resulting in resources being inappropriately diverted, untimelycompletion, substantial cost overruns, or inadequate information to manage our businesses andprepare accurate financial information. Should the project not be successfully completed thecapitalized cost for this project might have to be expensed resulting in an unanticipated reductionin profitability.SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS MAY DEFAULT ON THE DEBTS THEY OWE TO US.     Should the recent constraints on access to credit continue for a prolonged period some of ourcustomers may struggle or fail to meet their obligations, especially if they in turn experiencedefaults on receivables due from their customers. A continued recession could result in ourincurring bad debt costs in excess of our expectations and prior experience. In certain markets wehave experienced a consolidation among those entities to whom we sell. This consolidation, alongwith higher metals and other commodity prices, has resulted in an increased credit risk spread14Table of Contentsamong fewer customers often without a corresponding strengthening of their financial status.We have expanded our use of credit insurance for accounts receivable in our businesses. While webelieve the insurance companies with whom our accounts receivable are insured are capable ofmeeting their contract obligations, it is possible that we may not be capable of recovering all ofour insured losses should they experience significant losses threatening their viability.Additionally, credit insurance policies typically have relatively short policy periods and requirepre-approval of customers with maximum insured limits established by customer. Should creditinsurers incur large losses, the insurance may be more difficult to secure and when availablelikely only at increased costs with decreased coverage. While in many international salestransactions we require letters of credit from financial institutions which we believe to befinancially secure, we may be at risk in the event the financial institution subsequently fails andthe customer is unable to pay for the products we sold. A substantial amount of our accountsreceivable are considered to be open account uninsured accounts receivable. We regularly maintain asubstantial amount of accounts receivable, at year end $773 million. During the fiscal year, we incured bad debt expense of $34 million, charged off accountsreceivable of $13 million and had recoveries of $3 million and atyear end our allowance for collection losses was $42 million.POTENTIAL IMPACT OF OUR CUSTOMERS NON-COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING COMMERCIAL CONTRACTS ANDCOMMITMENTS.     Most consumers of the metals products we sell have been negatively impacted by the recession.Many of our customers have experienced reductions, some substantial, in their operations. Pricesfor many of the metals products we sell have declined, some substantially. These factors havecontributed to attempts by some customers to seek renegotiation or cancellation of their existingpurchase commitments. Some of our customers have breached previously agreed upon contracts to buyour products by refusing delivery of the products. Where appropriate we have and will in the futurepursue litigation to recover our damages resulting from customer contract defaults. A large numberof our customers defaulting on existing contractual obligations to purchase our products, wouldhave a material impact on our results of operations.THE AGREEMENTS GOVERNING THE NOTES AND OUR OTHER DEBT CONTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS AND IMPOSERESTRICTIONS ON OUR BUSINESS.     The indenture governing our 5.625% notes due 2013, 6.50% notes due 2017 and 7.35% notes due2018 contains restrictions on our ability to create liens, sell assets, enter into sale andleaseback transactions and consolidate or merge. In addition, our credit facility containscovenants that place restrictions on our ability to, among other things:  create liens;   enter into transactions with affiliates;   sell assets;   in the case of some of our subsidiaries, guarantee debt; and   consolidate or merge.     Our credit facility also requires that we meet certain financial tests and maintain certainfinancial ratios, including a maximum debt to capitalization and interest coverage ratios.     Other agreements that we may enter into in the future may contain covenants imposingsignificant restrictions on our business that are similar to, or in addition to, the covenantsunder our existing agreements. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our businessand may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.     Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control,including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. The breach of any of theserestrictions could result in a default under the indenture governing the notes or under our otherdebt agreements. An event of default under our debt agreements would permit some of our lenders todeclare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaidinterest. If we were unable to repay debt to our secured lenders or if we incur secured debt in thefuture, these lenders could proceed against the collateral securing that debt. In addition,acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on thenotes.15Table of ContentsFLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR RELATIVE TO OTHER CURRENCIES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OURBUSINESS.     Fluctuations in the value of the dollar can be expected to affect our business. In particularmajor changes in the rate of exchange of Chinas renminbi or the value of the euro to the U.S.dollar could negatively impact our business. A strong U.S. dollar makes imported metal productsless expensive, resulting in more imports of steel products into the United States by our foreigncompetitors while a weak U.S. dollar may have the opposite impact on imports. With the exception ofexports of non-ferrous scrap metal by our Americas Recycling segment we have not recently been asignificant exporter of metal products from our United States operations. Economic difficulties insome large steel producing regions of the world resulting in lower local demand for steel productshave historically encouraged greater steel exports to the United States at depressed prices and canbe exacerbated by a strong dollar. As a result, our products which are made in the United States,may become relatively more expensive as compared to imported steel, which has had and in the futurecould have a negative impact on our sales, revenues, profitability and cash flows.     A strong U.S. dollar hampers our international marketing and distribution business. Weak localcurrencies limit the amount of U.S. dollar denominated products that we can import for ourinternational operations and limits our ability to be competitive against local producers sellingin local currencies.OPERATING INTERNATIONALLY CARRIES RISKS AND UNCERTANTIES WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR RESULTSOF OPERATIONS.     We have our heaviest concentration of manufacturing facilities in the United States but alsohave significant facilities in Europe and Australia. Our marketing and trading offices are locatedin most major markets of the world with our suppliers and our customers located throughout theworld. Our marketing and distribution segment relies on substantial international shipments ofmaterials and products in the ordinary course of its business. Our stability, growth andprofitability are subject to a number of risks inherent in doing business internationally inaddition to the currency exchange risk discussed above, including:  political, military, terrorist or major pandemic events;   legal and regulatory requirements or limitations imposed by foreign governments(particularly those with significant steel consumption or steel related productionincluding China, Brazil, Russia and India) including quotas, tariffs or other protectionisttrade barriers, adverse tax law changes, nationalization or currency restrictions;   disruptions or delays in shipments caused by customs compliance or government agencies;and   potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations.WE RELY ON THE AVAILABILITY OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS FOR OUR MINIMILLOPERATIONS. DISRUPTIONS IN DELIVERY OR SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN ENERGY COSTS, INCLUDING CRUDE OILPRICES, COULD ADVERSLY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.     Minimills melt steel scrap in electric arc furnaces and use natural gas to heat steel billetsfor rolling into finished products. As large consumers of electricity and gas, often the largest inthe geographic area where our minimills are located, we must have dependable delivery ofelectricity and natural gas in order to operate. Accordingly, we are at risk in the event of anenergy disruption. Prolonged black-outs or brown-outs or disruptions caused by natural disasterssuch as hurricanes or by political considerations would substantially disrupt our production. Whilewe have not suffered prolonged production delays due to our inability to access electricity ornatural gas several of our competitors have experienced such occurrences. Prolonged substantialincreases in energy costs would have an adverse affect on the costs of operating our minimills andwould negatively impact our gross margins unless we were able to fully pass through the additionalexpense. Our finished steel products are typically delivered by truck. Rapid increases in the priceof fuel attributable to increases in crude oil prices will have a negative impact on our costs andmany of our customers financial results which could result in reduced margins and declining demandfor our products. Rapid increases in fuel costs may also negatively impact our ability to charterships for international deliveries at anticipated freight rates thereby decreasing our margins onthose transactions or causing our customers to look for alternative sources.16Table of ContentsIF WE LOSE THE SERVICES OF KEY EMPLOYEES WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR OPERATIONSAND MEET OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES.     Our future success depends, in large part, on the continued service of our officers and otherkey employees and our ability to continue to attract and retain additional highly qualifiedpersonnel. These employees are integral to our success based on their expertise and knowledge ofour business and products. We compete for such personnel with other companies including public andprivate company competitors who may periodically offer more favorable terms of employment. While wehave an employment agreement with our Chief Executive Officer, we typically do not have employmentagreements with other key employees. The loss or interruption of the services of a number of ourkey employees would reduce our ability to effectively manage our operations due to the fact that wemay not be able to find in a timely manner, appropriate replacement personnel should the needarise.WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY COMPETING WITH COMPANIES THAT HAVE A LOWER COST STRUCTURE OR ACCESS TOGREATER FINANCIAL RESOURCES.     We compete with regional, national and foreign manufacturers and traders. Consolidation amongparticipants in the steel manufacturing and recycling industries has resulted in fewer competitorsbut several which are significantly larger. Some of our larger competitors have greater financialresources and more diverse businesses than us. Some of our foreign competitors may be able topursue business opportunities without regard for the laws and regulations with which we mustcomply, such as environmental regulations. These companies may have a lower cost structure, moreoperating flexibility and consequently they may be able to offer better prices and more servicesthan we can. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with thesecompanies.OUR STEEL MINIMILL BUSINESS REQUIRES CONTINUOUS CAPITAL INVESTMENTS THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TOSUSTAIN.     We must make regular substantial capital investments in our steel minimills to lowerproduction costs and remain competitive. We cannot be certain that we will have sufficientinternally generated cash or acceptable external financing to make necessary substantial capitalexpenditures in the future. The availability of external financing depends on many factors outsideof our control, including capital market conditions and the overall performance of the economy. Iffunding is insufficient, we may be unable to develop or enhance our minimills, take advantage ofbusiness opportunities and respond to competitive pressures.SCRAP AND OTHER SUPPLIES FOR OUR BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT PRICE FLUCTUATIONS, WHICHMAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.     We depend on ferrous scrap, the primary feedstock for our steel minimills and other suppliessuch as graphite electrodes and ferroalloys for our steel minimill operations. Although we believethat the supply of scrap is adequate to meet future needs, the price of scrap and other supplieshave historically been subject to significant fluctuation. Our future profitability will beadversely affected if we are unable to pass on to our customers increased raw material and suppliescosts. We may not be able to adjust our product prices to recover the costs of rapid increases inmaterial prices, especially over the short-term and in our domestic fabrication segments fixedprice fabrication contracts.     The raw material used in manufacturing copper tubing is copper scrap, supplementedoccasionally by virgin copper ingot. Copper scrap has generally been readily available, and a smallportion of our copper scrap comes from our metal recycling yards. However, copper scrap is subjectto rapid price fluctuations related to the price and supply of virgin copper. Price increases forhigh quality copper scrap could adversely affect our business. Our Arkansas mill does not havemelting capacity, so it is dependent on an adequate supply of competitively priced used rail. Theavailability of used rail fluctuates with the pace of railroad abandonments, rail replacement byrailroads in the United States and abroad and demand for used rail from other domestic and foreignrail rerolling mills. Price increases for used rail could adversely affect our business.UNEXPECTED EQUIPMENT FAILURES MAY LEAD TO PRODUCTION CURTAILMENTS OR SHUTDOWNS.     Interruptions in our production capabilities will adversely affect our production costs, steelavailable for sales and earnings for the affected period. In addition to equipment failures, ourfacilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such asfires, explosions or violent weather conditions. Our manufacturing processes are dependent uponcritical pieces of steel-making equipment, such as our furnaces, continuous casters and rollingequipment, as well as electrical equipment, such as transformers. This equipment17Table of Contentsmay, on occasion, be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures. We have experiencedand may in the future experience material plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as aresult of such equipment failures.HEDGING TRANSACTIONS MAY EXPOSE US TO LOSS OR LIMIT OUR POTENTIAL GAINS.     Our product lines and worldwide operations expose us to risks associated with fluctuations inforeign currency exchange, commodity prices and interest rates. As part of our risk managementprogram, we use financial instruments, including commodity futures or forwards, foreign currencyexchange forward contracts and interest rate swaps. While intended to reduce the effects of thefluctuations, these transactions may limit our potential gains or expose us to loss. Should ourcounterparties to such transactions or the sponsors of the exchanges through which thesetransactions are offered, such as the London Metal Exchange, fail to honor their obligations due tofinancial distress we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipatedgains from these transactions.     We enter into the foreign currency exchange forwards as economic hedges of trade commitmentsor anticipated commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency to mitigatethe effects of changes in currency rates. Although we do not enter into these instruments fortrading purposes or speculation, and although our management believes all of these instruments areeconomically effective as hedges of underlying physical transactions, these foreign exchangecommitments are dependent on timely performance by our counterparties. Their failure to performcould result in our having to close these hedges without the anticipated underlying transaction andcould result in losses if foreign currency exchange rates have changed.WE ARE INVOLVED AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BECOME INVOLVED IN VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS THAT MAYRESULT IN FINES, PENALTIES OR JUDGMENTS BEING ASSESSED AGAINST US OR LIABILITY IMPOSED UPON USWHICH WE CANNOT PRESENTLY ESTIMATE OR REASONABLY FORESEE AND WHICH MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ONOUR EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS.     Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, calledCERCLA, or similar state statutes, we may have obligations to conduct investigation and remediationactivities associated with alleged releases of hazardous substances or to reimburse the EPA (orstate agencies as applicable) for such activities and to pay for natural resource damagesassociated with alleged releases. We have been named a potentially responsible party at severalfederal and state Superfund sites because the EPA or an equivalent state agency contends that weand other potentially responsible scrap metal suppliers are liable for the cleanup of those sitesas a result of having sold scrap metal to unrelated manufacturers for recycling as a raw materialin the manufacture of new products. We are involved in litigation or administrative proceedingswith regard to several of these sites in which we are contesting, or at the appropriate time maycontest, our liability at the sites. In addition, we have received information requests with regardto other sites which may be under consideration by the EPA as potential CERCLA sites.     Although we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure to loss inconnection with various environmental matters or the effect on our consolidated financial position,we make accruals as warranted. Due to inherent uncertainties, including evolving remediationtechnology, changing regulations, possible third-party contributions, the inherent shortcomings ofthe estimation process, the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors, the amounts weaccrue could vary significantly from the amounts we ultimately are required to pay.WE ARE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY.     We are involved in various litigation matters, including regulatory proceedings,administrative proceedings, governmental investigations, environmental matters and constructioncontract disputes. The nature of our operations also expose us to possible litigation claims in thefuture. Although we make every effort to avoid litigation, these matters are not totally within ourcontrol. We will contest these matters vigorously and have made insurance claims where appropriate,but because of the uncertain nature of litigation and coverage decisions, we cannot predict theoutcome of these matters. These matters could have a material adverse affect on our financialcondition and profitability. Litigation is very costly, and the costs associated with prosecutingand defending litigation matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditionand profitability. Although we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount ofexposure to loss in connection with litigation matters, we make accruals as warranted. However, theamounts that we accrue could vary significantly from the amounts we actually pay, due to inherentuncertainties and the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process, the uncertainties involvedin litigation and other factors.OUR SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS MUST BE AUDITED ANNUALLY AND THEOCCURRENCE OF A MATERIAL WEAKNESS MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OURBUSINESS REPUTATION, CREDIT RATINGS AND PARTICIPATION IN CAPITAL MARKETS.     Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act management must now assess the design and functioning of our system offinancial internal control. Our registered independent accountantsmust then certify the effectiveness of our internalcontrols. Discovery and disclosure of a material weakness, by definition may have a material adverse impact on ourfinancial statements. Such an occurrence may discourage certain customers or suppliers from doing business with us, may cause downgrades in our debtratings leading to higher borrowing costs, and may affect how ourstock trades. This may in turn negatively affect our ability to access public debt or equity markets for capital.18Table of Contents"
15,CMC,COMMERCIAL METALS,2008-10-30,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS     Before making an investment in our company, you should be aware of various risks, includingthose described below. You should carefully consider these risk factors together with all of theother information included in this annual report on Form 10-K. The risks described below are notthe only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those wecurrently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financialcondition, results of operations or cash flows. If any of these risks actually occur, our business,financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected andyou may lose all or part of your investment.RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRYOUR INDUSTRY IS AFFECTED BY CYCLICAL AND GLOBAL ECONOMIC FACTORS INCLUDING THE RISK OF A RECESSIONAND OUR CUSTOMERS ACCESS TO CREDIT FACILITIES.     Our financial results are substantially dependent upon the overall economic conditions in theUnited States and the European Union. A recession in the United States, the European Union, orglobally  or the public perception that a recession is likely  could substantially decrease thedemand for our products and adversely affect our business. Many of our products are commoditiessubject to cyclical fluctuations in supply and demand in metal consuming industries andconstruction. Metals industries have historically been vulnerable to significant declines inconsumption and product pricing during prolong periods of economic downturn. Likewise the pace ofconstruction has historically slowed significantly during economic downturns. Many of ourcustomers rely on access to credit to adequately fund their operations or to finance constructionprojects. The inability of our customers to access credit facilities will adversely affect ourbusiness by reducing our sales, increasing our exposure to accounts receivable bad debts andreducing our profitability. Our geographic concentration in the southern and southwestern UnitedStates as well as Central Europe, Australia and China exposes us to the local market conditions inthese regions. Economic downturns in these areas or decisions by governments that have an impact onthe level and pace of overall economic activity in a particular region could also adversely affectour sales and profitability.     Our business supports cyclical industries such as commercial and government construction,energy, metals service center, petrochemical and original equipment manufacturing. These industriesmay experience significant fluctuations in demand for our products based on economic conditions,energy prices, consumer demand and decisions by governments to fund infrastructure projects such ashighways, schools, energy plants and airports. Many of these factors are beyond our control. As aresult of the volatility in the industries we serve, we may have difficulty increasing ormaintaining our level of sales or profitability. If the industries we serve suffer a prolongeddownturn, then our business may be adversely affected. Although the residential housing market isnot a significant factor in our business, related commercial and infrastructure constructionactivities, such as shopping centers and roads could be impacted by a prolonged slump in newhousing construction.     Our industry is characterized by low backlogs, which means that our results of operations arepromptly affected by short-term economic fluctuations.A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN CHINAS STEEL CONSUMPTION OR INCREASED CHINESE STEEL PRODUCTIONSUBSTANTIALLY EXCEEDING LOCAL DEMAND MAY RESULT IN CHINA BECOMING A LARGE EXPORTER OF STEEL ANDDISRUPTION TO WORLD STEEL MARKETS.     Chinese economic expansion has affected the availability and heightened the volatility of manycommodities that we market and use in our manufacturing process, including steel. It is reportedthat in calendar year 2007 China produced approximately 489 million metric tons of crude steel,representing 37% of world production. Chinas estimated consumption was approximately 434 millionmetric tons and was a net exporter of approximately 46 million tons in 2007. Expansions andcontractions in Chinas economy can have major effects on the pricing of not only the price of ourfinished steel products but also many commodities that affect us such as secondary metals, energy,marine freight rates, steel making supplies such as ferroalloys and graphite electrodes andmaterials we market such as iron ore and coke. Should Chinese demand weaken or Chinese steelproduction be allowed to expand unchecked to the point that it significantly exceeds the countrysconsumption, prices for many of the products that we both sell to and export from China may fallcausing erosion in our gross margins and subjecting us to possible renegotiation of contracts orincreases in bad debts. Significant exports from China of steel in the product lines we manufacturein the United States would cause selling prices in the United States to decline and negativelyimpact our gross margins.10Table of ContentsRAPID AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF METALS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR INDUSTRY.     Prices for most metals in which we deal have experienced large increases accompanied withincreased volatility over the last several years. More recently steelprices have begun to sharply declinefrom their peaks but are at still relatively high levels. With a few exceptions, our markets havethus far been able to adapt to this changing pricing environment. However, should metals pricesexperience further substantial rapid decreases, increases or be subjected to sudden increases itwould impact us in several ways. Some of our operations, the fabrication operations for example,may benefit from rapidly decreasing steel prices as their material cost for previously contractedfixed price work declines. Others, such as our Americas Mills and International Mills segments,would likely experience reduced margins and may be forced to liquidate high cost inventory atreduced margins or losses until prices stabilized. Sudden increases could have the opposite effect.Overall, we believe that rapid substantial price changes, should theycontinue to occur, will not be to ourindustrys benefit. Our customer and supplier base would be impacted due to uncertainty as tofuture prices. A reluctance to purchase inventory in the face of extreme price decreases or sellquickly during a period of rapid price increases would likely reduce our volume of business.Marginal industry participants or speculators may attempt to participate to an unhealthy extentduring a period of rapid price escalation with a substantial risk of contract default should pricessuddenly reverse. Risks of default in contract performance by customers or suppliers as well as anincreased risk of bad debts and customer credit exposure would increase during periods of rapid andsubstantial price changes.EXCESS CAPACITY IN OUR INDUSTRY COULD INCREASE THE LEVEL OF STEEL IMPORTS INTO THE U.S. RESULTINGIN LOWER DOMESTIC PRICES WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SALES, MARGINS AND PROFITABILITY.     Steel-making capacity exceeds demand for steel products in some countries. Rather thanreducing employment by rationalizing capacity with consumption, steel manufacturers in thesecountries (often with local government assistance or subsidies in various forms) have traditionallyperiodically exported steel at prices significantly below their home market prices and which maynot reflect their costs of production or capital. This supply of imports can decrease thesensitivity of domestic steel prices to increases in demand or our ability to recover increasedmanufacturing costs.COMPLIANCE WITH AND CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND REMEDIATION REQUIREMENTS COULD RESULT INSUSTANTIALLY INCREASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OPERATING COSTS.     Existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, orfuture laws or regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations andfinancial condition. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is a significant factor inour business. We are subject to local, state, federal and international environmental laws andregulations concerning, among other matters, waste disposal, air emissions, waste and storm watereffluent and disposal and employee health. New facilities that we may build, especially steelminimills, are required to obtain several environmental permits before significant construction orcommencement of operations. Delays in obtaining permits or unanticipated conditions in suchpermits could delay the project or increase construction costs or operating expenses. Ourmanufacturing and recycling operations produce significant amounts of by-products, some of whichare handled as industrial waste or hazardous waste. For example, our minimills generate electricarc furnace dust (EAF dust), which the EPA and other regulatory authorities classify as hazardouswaste. EAF dust requires special handling, recycling or disposal.     In addition, the primary feed materials for the shredders operated by our scrap metalrecycling facilities are automobile hulks and obsolete household appliances. Approximately 20% ofthe weight of an automobile hulk consists of unrecyclable material known as shredder fluff. Afterthe segregation of ferrous and saleable non-ferrous metals, shredder fluff remains. We, along withothers in the recycling industry, interpret Federal regulations to require shredder fluff to meetcertain criteria and pass a toxic leaching test to avoid classification as a hazardous waste. Wealso endeavor to remove hazardous contaminants from the feed material prior to shredding. As aresult, we believe the shredder fluff we generate is not normally considered or properly classifiedas hazardous waste. If the laws, regulations or testing methods change with regard to EAF dust orshredder fluff, we may incur additional significant expenditures.11Table of Contents     Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws andregulations, legal requirements are changing frequently and are subject to interpretation. Newlaws, regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities, together with uncertaintyregarding adequate pollution control levels, testing and sampling procedures, new pollution controltechnology and cost benefit analysis based on market conditions are all factors that may increaseour future expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. Accordingly, we are unable topredict the ultimate cost of future compliance with these requirements or their effect on ouroperations. We cannot predict whether such costs can be passed on to customers through productprice increases. Competitors in various regions or countries where environmental regulation mightnot be so restrictive, subject to different interpretation or generally not enforced, may enjoy acompetitive advantage.     We may also be required to conduct additional clean up at sites where we have alreadyparticipated in remediation efforts or to take remediation action with regard to sites formerlyused in connection with our operations. We may be required to pay for a portion of the costs ofclean up or remediation at sites we never owned or on which we never operated if we are found tohave arranged for treatment or disposal of hazardous substances on the sites.RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMPANYPOTENTIAL LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS CREDIT FACILITIES MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS     Although we believe we have adequate access to several sources of contractually committedborrowings and other available credit facilities (see the discussion at page 34 of our liquidity),we could be adversely affected if our banks, the buyers of our commercial paper or other of thetraditional sources supplying our short term borrowing requirements refused to honor their contractcommitments or ceased lending. While we believe the lending institutions participating in ourcredit arrangements are financially capable, recent events in the global credit markets, includingthe failure, takeover or rescue by various government entities of major financial institutions,have created uncertainty of credit availability to an extent not experienced in recent decades.Our commercial paper program is ranked in the second highest category by Moodys Investors Service(P-2) and Standard & Poors Corporation (A-2). Our senior unsecured debt is investment grade ratedby Standard & Poors Corporation (BBB) and Moodys Investors Service (Baa2). In determining ourcredit ratings, the rating agencies consider a number of both quantitative and qualitative factors.These factors include earnings, fixed charges such as interest, cash flows, total debt outstanding,off balance sheet obligations and other commitments, total capitalization and various ratioscalculated from these factors. The rating agencies also consider predictability of cash flows,business strategy and diversity, industry conditions and contingencies. Lower ratings on ourcommercial paper program or our senior unsecured debt could impair our ability to obtain additionalfinancing and will increase the cost of the financing that we doobtain.WE HAVE INITIATED IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING SYSTEM WHICH, IF NOTEFFECTIVELY MANAGED AND CONTROLLED, COULD THREATEN THE ACHIEVEMENT OF OPERATION AND FINANCIALGOALS.     In 2006 we began planning and design of a new enterprise resource planning system whichcontinued through 2007 with phased implementation having commenced during 2008 and currentlyscheduled to continue through 2010 prior to completion. This is a significant project withexpenditures thus far of approximately $172 million of which$83 million has been capitalized. There arerisks that the effort may not result in a successful implementation resulting in resources beinginappropriately diverted, untimely completion, substantial cost overruns, or inadequate informationto manage our businesses and prepare accurate financial information. Should the project not besuccessfully completed the capitalized cost for this project might have to be expensed resulting inan unanticipated reduction in profitability.SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS MAY DEFAULT ON THE DEBTS THEY OWE TO US.     Should the recent constraints on access to credit continue for a prolonged period some of ourcustomers may struggle or fail to meet their obligations, especially if they in turn experiencedefaults on receivables due from their customers. A recession could result in our incurring baddebt costs in excess of our expectations and prior experience. In certain markets we haveexperienced a consolidation among those entities to whom we sell. This12Table of Contentsconsolidation, along with higher metals and other commodity prices, has resulted in anincreased credit risk spread among fewer customers often without a corresponding strengthening oftheir financial status. We have expanded our use of credit insurance for accounts receivable in ourbusinesses. While we believe the insurance companies with whom our accounts receivable are insuredare capable of meeting their contract obligations, it is possible that we may not be capable ofrecovering all of our insured losses should they experience significant losses threatening theirviability. Additionally, credit insurance policies typically have relatively short policy periodsand require pre-approval of customers with maximum insured limits established by customer. Shouldcredit insurers incur large losses the insurance may be more difficult to secure and when availablelikely only at increased costs with decreased coverage. While in many international salestransactions we require letters of credit from financial institutions which we believe to befinancially secure we may be at risk in the event the financial institution subsequently fails andthe customer is unable to pay for the products we sold. A substantial amount of our accountsreceivable are considered to be open account uninsured accounts receivable. We regularly maintaina substantial amount of accounts receivable, at year end $1.4 billion. We charged off accountsreceivable of $10.1 million during the past fiscal year offset by recoveries of $5 million and atyear end our allowance for collection losses was $17.7 million.THE AGREEMENTS GOVERNING THE NOTES AND OUR OTHER DEBT CONTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS AND IMPOSERESTRICTIONS ON OUR BUSINESS.     The indenture governing our 6.75% notes due 2009, 5.625% notes due 2013, 6.50% notes due 2017and 7.35% notes due 2018 contains restrictions on our ability to create liens, sell assets, enterinto sale and leaseback transactions and consolidate or merge. In addition, our credit facilitycontains covenants that place restrictions on our ability to, among other things:  create liens;   enter into transactions with affiliates;   sell assets;   in the case of some of our subsidiaries, guarantee debt; and   consolidate or merge.     Our credit facility also requires that we meet certain financial tests and maintain certainfinancial ratios, including a maximum debt to capitalization and interest coverage ratios.     Other agreements that we may enter into in the future may contain covenants imposingsignificant restrictions on our business that are similar to, or in addition to, the covenantsunder our existing agreements. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our businessand may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.     Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control,including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. The breach of any of theserestrictions could result in a default under the indenture governing the notes or under our otherdebt agreements. An event of default under our debt agreements would permit some of our lenders todeclare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaidinterest. If we were unable to repay debt to our secured lenders or if we incur secured debt in thefuture, these lenders could proceed against the collateral securing that debt. In addition,acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on thenotes.FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR RELATIVE TO OTHER CURRENCIES MAY ADVERSELYAFFECT OUR BUSINESS.     Fluctuations in the value of the dollar can be expected to affect our business. In particularmajor changes in the rate of exchange of Chinas Renminbi or the value of the Euro to the U.S.Dollar could negatively impact our business. A strong U.S. dollar makes imported metal productsless expensive, resulting in more imports of steel products into the U.S. by our foreigncompetitors while a weak U.S. dollar may have the opposite impact on13Table of Contentsimports. With the exception of exports of non-ferrous scrap metal by our Americas Recyclingsegment we have not recently been a significant exporter of metal products from our United Statesoperations. Economic difficulties in some large steel producingregions of the world resulting inlower local demand for steel products have historically encouraged greater steel exports to the U.S. atdepressed prices and can be exacerbated by a strong dollar. As a result, our products which are made in the U.S., may become relatively moreexpensive as compared to imported steel, which has had and in the future could have a negativeimpact on our sales, revenues, profitability and cash flows.     A strong U.S. dollar hampers our international marketing and distribution business. Weak localcurrencies limit the amount of U.S. dollar denominated products that we can import for ourinternational operations and limits our ability to be competitive against local producers sellingin local currencies.OPERATING INTERNATIONALLY CARRIES RISKS AND UNCERTANTIES WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR RESULTSOF OPERATIONS.     Wehave our heaviest concentration of manufacturing facilities in the United States but alsohave significant facilities in Europe and Australia. Our marketing and trading offices are locatedin most major markets of the world with our suppliers and our customers located throughout theworld. Our marketing and distribution segment relies on substantial international shipments ofmaterials and products in the ordinary course of its business. Our stability, growth andprofitability are subject to a number of risks inherent in doing business internationally inaddition to the currency exchange risk discussed above, including:  political, military, terrorist or major pandemic events;   legal and regulatory requirements or limitations imposed by foreign governments(particularly those with significant steel consumption or steel related productionincluding China, Brazil, Russia and India) including quotas, tariffs or other protectionisttrade barriers, adverse tax law changes, nationalization or currency restrictions;   disruptions or delays in shipments caused by customs compliance or government agencies;and   potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations.WE RELY ON THE AVAILABILITY OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS FOR OUR MINIMILLOPERATIONS.

You should carefully consider these risk factors together with allof the other information included in this annual report on Form 10-K. The risks described below arenot the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or thosewe currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financialcondition, results of operations or cash flows. If any of these risks actually occur, our business,financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected andyou may lose all or part of your investment.RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRYA SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN CHINAS STEEL CONSUMPTION OR INCREASED CHINESE STEEL PRODUCTIONSUBSTANTIALLY EXCEEDING LOCAL DEMAND MAY RESULT IN CHINA BECOMING A LARGE EXPORTER OF STEEL ANDDISRUPTION TO WORLD STEEL MARKETS.     Chinese economicexpansion has affected the availability and heightened the volatility ofmany commodities that we market and use in our manufacturing process, including steel. It isreported that in calendar year 2006 China produced 423 millionmetric tons of crude steel, representing 35% of world production. Chinas estimated consumption was356 million metric tons and was a net exporter of32 million tons in 2006. In 2006 China became the largestexporter of steel to the U.S. Expansions and contractions in Chinas economy can have major effects on the pricingof not only the price of our finished steel products but also many commodities that affect us suchas secondary metals, energy, marine freight rates, steel making supplies such as ferroalloys andgraphite electrodes and materials we market such as iron ore and coke. Should Chinese demand weakenor Chinese steel production be allowed to expand unchecked to the point that it significantlyexceeds the countrys consumption, prices for many of the products that we both sell to and exportfrom China may fall causing erosion in our gross margins and subjecting us to possiblerenegotiation of contracts or increases in bad debts. Significant exports from China of steel inthe9Table of Contentsproduct lines we manufacture in the United States would cause selling prices in the United Statesto decline and negatively impact our gross margins.RAPID AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF METALS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR INDUSTRY.     Prices for most metals in which we deal have experienced large increases and increasedvolatility in recent years. With a few exceptions, our markets have been able to adapt to thischanging pricing environment. However, should metals prices experience further unanticipated andeven more substantial rapid increases or be subjected to sudden substantial decreases it wouldimpact us in several ways. Some of our operations, the domestic fabrication segment for example,may benefit from rapidly decreasing steel prices as their material cost decline while others, suchas our domestic mill and CMCZ segments, would likely experience reduced margins until pricesstabilized. Sudden increases could have the opposite effect. Overall, we believe that rapidsubstantial price changes, should they occur, will not be to our industrys benefit. Our customerand supplier base would be impacted due to uncertainty as to future prices. A reluctance topurchase inventory in the face of extreme price decreases or sell quickly during a period of rapidprice increases would likely reduce our volume of business. Marginal industry participants orspeculators may attempt to participate to an unhealthy extent during a period of rapid priceescalation with a substantial risk of contract default should prices suddenly reverse. Risks ofdefault in contract performance by customers or suppliers as well as a increased risk of bad debtsand customer credit exposure would increase during periods of rapid and substantial price changes.EXCESS CAPACITY IN OUR INDUSTRY COULD INCREASE THE LEVEL OF STEEL IMPORTS INTO THE U.S. RESULTINGIN LOWER DOMESTIC PRICES WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SALES, MARGINS AND PROFITABILITY.     Steel-making capacity exceeds demand for steel products in some countries. Rather thanreducing employment by rationalizing capacity with consumption, steel manufacturers in thesecountries (often with local government assistance or subsidies in various forms) have traditionallyperiodically exported steel at prices significantly below their home market prices and which maynot reflect their costs of production or capital. This supply of imports can decrease thesensitivity of domestic steel prices to increases in demand or our ability to recover increasedmanufacturing costs.OUR INDUSTRY IS AFFECTED BY CYCLICAL AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC FACTORS INCLUDING THE RISK OF A SLOWDOWN IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY OR RECESSION.     Many of our products are commodities subject to cyclical fluctuations in supply anddemand in metal consuming industries. Metals industries have historically been vulnerable tosignificant declines in consumption and product pricing during prolong periods of economicdownturn. A recession in either the United States or the European Union or the public perceptionthat a slowdown or recession may occur, could decrease the demand for our products and adverselyaffect our business. Our overall financial results will be dependent substantially upon the extentto which economic conditions in both the United States and the European Union remain strong.Overall economic activity has historically been susceptible to declines following periods ofrapidly increased energy costs or interest rates. A slower expansion or recession will adverselyaffect our financial results. Our geographic concentration in the southern and southwestern UnitedStates as well as Central Europe, Australia and China exposes us to the local market conditions inthese regions. Economic downturns in these areas or decisions by governments that have an impact onthe level and pace of overall economic activity could adversely affect our sales and profitability.     Our business supports cyclical industries such as commercial construction, energy,service center, petrochemical and original equipment manufacturing. These industries may experiencesignificant fluctuations in demand for our products based on economic conditions, energy prices,consumer demand and decisions by governments to fund infrastructure projects such as highways,schools, energy plants and airports. Many of these factors are beyond our control. As a result ofthe volatility in the industries we serve, we may have difficulty increasing or maintaining ourlevel of sales or profitability. If the industries we serve suffer a prolonged downturn, then ourbusiness may be adversely affected. Although the residential housing market is not a significantfactor in our business related commercial and infrastructure construction activities, such asshopping centers and roads could be impacted by a prolonged slump in new housing construction.10Table of Contents     Our industry is characterized by low backlogs, which means that our results of operationsare promptly affected by short-term economic fluctuations.COMPLIANCE WITH AND CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND REMEDIATION REQUIREMENTS COULD RESULT INSUSTANTIALLY INCREASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OPERATING COSTS.     Existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, orfuture laws or regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations andfinancial condition. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is a significant factor inour business. We are subject to local, state, federal and international environmental laws andregulations concerning, among other matters, waste disposal, air emissions, waste and storm watereffluent and disposal and employee health. Our new micromill to be built in Arizona is required toobtain several environmental permits before significant construction or commencement of operations.While we believe that permitting process is proceeding as planned, delays in obtaining permits orunanticipated conditions in such permits could delay the project or increase construction costs oroperating expenses. Our manufacturing and recycling operations produce significant amounts ofby-products, some of which are handled as industrial waste or hazardous waste. For example, ourminimills generate electric arc furnace dust (EAF dust), which the EPA and other regulatoryauthorities classify as hazardous waste. EAF dust requires special handling, recycling or disposal.     In addition, the primary feed materials for the shredders operated by our scrap metalrecycling facilities are automobile hulks and obsolete household appliances. Approximately 20% ofthe weight of an automobile hulk consists of unrecyclable material known as shredder fluff. Afterthe segregation of ferrous and saleable non-ferrous metals, shredder fluff remains. We, along withothers in the recycling industry, interpret Federal regulations to require shredder fluff to meetcertain criteria and pass a toxic leaching test to avoid classification as a hazardous waste. Wealso endeavor to remove hazardous contaminants from the feed material prior to shredding. As aresult, we believe the shredder fluff we generate is not normally considered or properly classifiedas hazardous waste. If the laws, regulations or testing methods change with regard to EAF dust orshredder fluff, we may incur additional significant expenditures.     Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws andregulations, legal requirements are changing frequently and are subject to interpretation. Newlaws, regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities, together with uncertaintyregarding adequate pollution control levels, testing and sampling procedures, new pollution controltechnology and cost benefit analysis based on market conditions are all factors that may increaseour future expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. Accordingly, we are unable topredict the ultimate cost of future compliance with these requirements or their effect on ouroperations. We cannot predict whether such costs can be passed on to customers through productprice increases. Competitors in various regions or countries where environmental regulation mightnot be so restrictive, subject to different interpretation or generally not enforced may enjoy acompetitive advantage.     We may also be required to conduct additional clean up at sites where we have alreadyparticipated in remediation efforts or to take remediation action with regard to sites formerlyused in connection with our operations. We may be required to pay for a portion of the costs ofclean up or remediation at sites we never owned or on which we never operated if we are found tohave arranged for treatment or disposal of hazardous substances on the sites.RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMPANYFLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR RELATIVE TO OTHER CURRENCIES MAY ADVERSELYAFFECT OUR BUSINESS.     Fluctuations in the value of the dollar can be expected to affect our business. Inparticular major changes in the rate of exchange of Chinas Renminbi or continuing substantialincreases in the value of the Euro to the U.S. Dollar could negatively impact our business. Astrong U.S. dollar makes imported metal products less expensive, resulting in more imports of steelproducts into the U.S. by our foreign competitors while a weak U.S. dollar may have the oppositeimpact on imports. With the exception of exports of non-ferrous scrap metal exports by ourrecycling segment we have not recently been a significant exporter of metal products from ourUnited States operations. Past economic difficulties in Eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America haveresulted in lower local demand for steel11Table of Contentsproducts and have encouraged greater steel exports to the U.S. at depressed prices. As a result,our products which are made in the U.S., may become relatively more expensive as compared toimported steel, which has had and in the future could have a negative impact on our sales,revenues, profitability and cash flows.     A strong U.S. dollar hampers our international marketing and distribution business. Weaklocal currencies limit the amount of U.S. dollar denominated products that we can import for ourinternational operations and limits our ability to be competitive against local producers sellingin local currencies.OPERATING INTERNATIONALLY CARRIES RISKS AND UNCERTANTIES WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR RESULTSOF OPERATIONS.     We have our heaviest concentration of manufacturing operations in the United States butalso have significant facilities in Europe and Australia. Our marketing and trading offices arelocated in most major markets of the world with our suppliers and our customers located throughoutthe world. Our marketing and distribution segment relies on substantial international shipments ofmaterials and products in the ordinary course of its business. Our stability, growth andprofitability are subject to a number of risks inherent in doing business internationally inaddition to the currency exchange risk discussed above, including:  Political, military, terrorist or major pandemic events;   Legal and regulatory requirements or limitations imposed by foreign governments(particularly those with significant steel consumption or steel related productionincluding China, Brazil, Russia and India) including quotas, tariffs or other protectionisttrade barriers, adverse tax law changes, nationalization or currency restrictions;   Disruptions or delays in shipments caused by customs compliance or government agencies;and   Potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations.WE RELY ON THE AVAILABILITY OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS FOR OUR MINIMILLOPERATIONS. DISRUPTIONS IN DELIVERY OR SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN ENERGY COSTS, INCLUDING CRUDE OILPRICES, COULD ADVERSLY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.     Minimills melt steel scrap in electric arc furnaces and use natural gas to heat steel billetsfor rolling into finished products. As large consumers of electricity and gas, often the largest inthe geographic area where our minimills are located, we must have dependable delivery ofelectricity and natural gas in order to operate. Accordingly, we are at risk in the event of anenergy disruption. Prolonged black-outs or brown-outs or disruptions caused by natural disasterssuch as hurricanes would substantially disrupt our production. While we have not suffered prolongedproduction delays due to our inability to access electricity or natural gas several of ourcompetitors have experienced such occurrences. Prolonged substantial increases in energy costswould have an adverse affect on the costs of operating our minimills and would negatively impactour gross margins unless we were able to fully pass through the additional expense. Our finishedsteel products are typically delivered by truck. Rapid increases in the price of fuel attributableto increases in crude oil prices will have a negative impact on our costs and many of our customersfinancial results which could result in reduced margins and declining demand for our products.Rapid increases in fuel costs may also negatively impact our ability to charter ships forinternational deliveries at anticipated freight rates thereby decreasing our margins on thosetransactions or causing our customers to look for alternative sources.IF WE LOSE THE SERVICES OF KEY EMPLOYEES WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR OPERATIONSAND MEET OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES.     Our future success depends, in large part, on the continued service of our officers andother key employees and our ability to continue to attract and retain additional highly qualifiedpersonnel. These employees are integral to our success based on their expertise and knowledge ofour business and products. We compete for such personnel with other companies including public andprivate company competitors who may periodically offer more favorable terms of employment. While wehave an employment agreement with our Chief Executive Officer, we typically do not have employmentagreements with other key employees. The loss or interruption of the services of a number of12Table of Contentsour key employees would reduce our ability to effectively manage our operations due to the factthat we may not be able to find in a timely manner, appropriate replacement personnel should theneed arise.WE HAVE INITIATED IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING SYSTEM WHICH, IF NOTEFFECTIVELY MANAGED AND CONTROLLED, COULD THREATEN THE ACHIEVEMENT OF OPERATION AND FINANCIALGOALS.     Planning and design of a new enterprise resource planning system commenced in 2006 andcontinued through 2007 with phased implementation scheduled commencing in 2008 and continuing forseveral years thereafter prior to completion. This is a significant project with expenses thus farof approximately $68.5 million of which $33.5 have been capitalized. There are risks that thiseffort may not result in a successful implementation resulting in resources being inappropriatelydiverted, untimely completion, substantial cost overruns, or inadequate information to manage ourbusinesses and prepare accurate financial information. Should the project not be successfullycompleted the capitalized cost for this project might have to be expensed resulting in anunanticipated reduction in profitability.WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY COMPETING WITH COMPANIES THAT HAVE A LOWER COST STRUCTURE OR ACCESS TOGREATER FINANCIAL RESOURCES.     We compete with regional, national and foreign manufacturers and traders. Consolidationamong participants in the steel manufacturing and recycling industries has resulted in fewercompetitors but several which are significantly larger. Some of our larger competitors havegreater financial resources and more diverse businesses than us. Some of our foreign competitorsmay be able to pursue business opportunities without regard for the laws and regulations with whichwe must comply, such as environmental regulations. These companies may have a lower cost structure,more operating flexibility and consequently they may be able to offer better prices and moreservices than we can. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with thesecompanies.     Furthermore, over the past decade, many integrated domestic steel producers and scrapmetal recyclers entered bankruptcy proceedings. The companies that have reorganized and emergedfrom bankruptcy may have a more competitive capital cost structure than their predecessorsresulting in more effective competition. In addition, asset sales by these companies during thereorganization process tended to be at depressed prices, enabling some purchasers to acquireincreased capacity at a lower cost.OUR STEEL MINIMILL BUSINESS REQUIRES CONTINUOUS CAPITAL INVESTMENTS THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TOSUSTAIN.     We must make regular substantial capital investments in our steel minimills to lowerproduction costs and remain competitive. We cannot be certain that we will have sufficientinternally generated cash or acceptable external financing to make necessary substantial capitalexpenditures in the future. The availability of external financing depends on many factors outsideof our control, including capital market conditions and the overall performance of the economy. Iffunding is insufficient, we may be unable to develop or enhance our minimills, take advantage ofbusiness opportunities and respond to competitive pressures.SCRAP AND OTHER SUPPLIES FOR OUR BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT PRICE FLUCTUATIONS, WHICHMAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.     We depend on ferrous scrap, the primary feedstock for our steel minimills and othersupplies such as graphite electrodes and ferroalloys for our steel minimill operations. Although webelieve that the supply of scrap is adequate to meet future needs, the price of scrap and othersupplies have historically been subject to significant fluctuation. Our future profitability willbe adversely affected if we are unable to pass on to our customers increased raw material andsupplies costs. We may not be able to adjust our product prices to recover the costs of rapidincreases in material prices, especially over the short-term and in our domestic fabricationsegments fixed price fabrication contracts.     The raw material used in manufacturing copper tubing is copper scrap, supplementedoccasionally by virgin copper ingot. Copper scrap has generally been readily available, and a smallportion of our copper scrap comes from our metal recycling yards. However, copper scrap is subjectto rapid price fluctuations related to the price and supply of virgin copper. Price increases forhigh quality copper scrap could adversely affect our business. Finally,13Table of Contentsour Arkansas mill does not have melting capacity, so it is dependent on an adequate supply ofcompetitively priced used rail. The availability of used rail fluctuates with the pace of railroadabandonments, rail replacement by railroads in the United States and abroad and demand for usedrail from other domestic and foreign rail rerolling mills. Price increases for used rail couldadversely affect our business.UNEXPECTED EQUIPMENT FAILURES MAY LEAD TO PRODUCTION CURTAILMENTS OR SHUTDOWNS.     Interruptions in our production capabilities will adversely affect our production costs,steel available for sales and earnings for the affected period. In addition to equipment failures,our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events suchas fires, explosions or violent weather conditions. Our manufacturing processes are dependent uponcritical pieces of steel-making equipment, such as our furnaces, continuous casters and rollingequipment, as well as electrical equipment, such as transformers, and this equipment may, onoccasion, be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures. We have experienced and may inthe future experience material plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of suchequipment failures.HEDGING TRANSACTIONS MAY LIMIT OUR POTENTIAL GAINS OR EXPOSE US TO LOSS.     Our product lines and worldwide operations expose us to risks associated withfluctuations in foreign currency exchange, commodity prices and interest rates. As part of our riskmanagement program, we use financial instruments, including commodity futures or forwards, foreigncurrency exchange forward contracts and interest rate swaps. While intended to reduce the effectsof the fluctuations, these transactions may limit our potential gains or expose us to loss. Shouldour counterparties to such transactions or the sponsors of the exchanges through which thesetransactions are offered, such as the London Metal Exchange, fail to honor their obligations due tofinancial distress we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipatedgains from these transactions.     We enter into the foreign currency exchange forwards as economic hedges of tradecommitments or anticipated commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currencyto mitigate the effects of changes in currency rates. Although we do not enter into theseinstruments for trading purposes or speculation, and although our management believes all of theseinstruments are economically effective as hedges of underlying physical transactions, these foreignexchange commitments are dependent on timely performance by our counterparties. Their failure toperform could result in our having to close these hedges without the anticipated underlyingtransaction and could result in losses if foreign currency exchange rates have changed.WE ARE INVOLVED AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BECOME INVOLVED IN VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS THAT MAYRESULT IN FINES, PENALTIES OR JUDGMENTS BEING ASSESSED AGAINST US OR LIABILITY IMPOSED UPON USWHICH WE CANNOT PRESENTLY ESTIMATE OR REASONABLY FORESEE AND WHICH MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ONOUR EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS.     Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980,called CERCLA, or similar state statutes, we may have obligations to conduct investigation andremediation activities associated with alleged releases of hazardous substances or to reimburse theEPA (or state agencies as applicable) for such activities and to pay for natural resource damagesassociated with alleged releases. We have been named a potentially responsible party at severalfederal and state Superfund sites because the EPA or an equivalent state agency contends that weand other potentially responsible scrap metal suppliers are liable for the cleanup of those sitesas a result of having sold scrap metal to unrelated manufacturers for recycling as a raw materialin the manufacture of new products. We are involved in litigation or administrative proceedingswith regard to several of these sites in which we are contesting, or at the appropriate time maycontest, our liability at the sites. In addition, we have received information requests with regardto other sites which may be under consideration by the EPA as potential CERCLA sites.     Although we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure toloss in connection with various environmental matters or the effect on our consolidated financialposition, we make accruals as warranted. Due to inherent uncertainties, including evolvingremediation technology, changing regulations, possible third-party contributions, the inherentshortcomings of the estimation process, the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors,the amounts we accrue could vary significantly from the amounts we ultimately are required to pay.14Table of ContentsAN INABILITY TO FULLY AND EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATE FUTURE ACQUISITIONS COULD RESULT IN INCREASED COSTSWHILE DIVERTING MANAGEMENTS ATTENTION FROM OUR CORE OPERATIONS, AND WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WEWILL REALIZE THEIR FULL BENEFITS OR SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR COMBINED COMPANY, AND FUTUREACQUISITIONS MAY RESULT IN DILUTIVE EQUITY ISSUANCES OR INCREASES IN DEBT.     As part of our ongoing business strategy we regularly evaluate and may pursueacquisitions of and investments in complementary companies. We cannot assure you that we will beable to fully or successfully integrate recent or future acquisitions in a timely manner or at all.If we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions, we may incur costs and delays or otheroperational, technical or financial problems, any of which could adversely affect our business. Inaddition, managements attention may be diverted from core operations which could harm our abilityto timely meet the needs of our customers and damage our relationships with those customers. Tofinance future acquisitions, we may need to raise funds either by issuing equity securities orincurring or assuming debt. If we incur additional debt, the related interest expense maysignificantly reduce our profitability.WE ARE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY.     We are involved in various litigation matters, including regulatory proceedings,administrative proceedings, governmental investigations, environmental matters and constructioncontract disputes. The nature of our operations also expose us to possible litigation claims in thefuture. Although we make every effort to avoid litigation, these matters are not totally within ourcontrol. We will contest these matters vigorously and have made insurance claims where appropriate,but because of the uncertain nature of litigation and coverage decisions, we cannot predict theoutcome of these matters. These matters could have a material adverse affect on our financialcondition and profitability. Litigation is very costly, and the costs associated with prosecutingand defending litigation matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditionand profitability. Although we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount ofexposure to loss in connection with litigation matters, we make accruals as warranted. However, theamounts that we accrue could vary significantly from the amounts we actually pay, due to inherentuncertainties and the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process, the uncertainties involvedin litigation and other factors.SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS MAY DEFAULT ON THE DEBTS THEY OWE TO US.     Economic conditions are not consistent in all the markets we serve. Some areas are stillweak, and our customers may struggle to meet their obligations, especially if a significantcustomer of theirs defaults. We regularly maintain a substantial amount of accounts receivable, atyear end almost $1.1 billion. We charged off accounts receivable of $3.3 million during the pastfiscal year offset by recoveries of $4.0 million and at year end our allowance for collectionlosses was $16.5 million. Other factors such as management and accounting irregularities haveforced some companies into bankruptcy. A weakening of the general economy and corporate failurescould result in higher bad debt costs. In certain markets we have experienced a consolidation amongthose entities to whom we sell. This consolidation, along with substantially higher metals andother commodity prices, has resulted in an increased credit risk spread among fewer customerswithout a corresponding strengthening of their financial status. Although we have expanded our useof credit insurance for accounts receivable in our marketing and distribution segment and requireletters of credit from reputable financial institutions in many international sales transactions,the majority of our receivables in our other segments are considered to be open account uninsuredaccounts receivable.CREDIT RATINGS AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN FINANCING AND THE COST OF SUCH FINANCING.     Credit ratings affect our ability to obtain financing and the cost of such financing. Ourcommercial paper program is ranked in the second highest category by Moodys Investors Service(P-2) and Standard & Poors Corporation (A-2). Our senior unsecured debt is investment grade ratedby Standard & Poors Corporation (BBB) and Moodys Investors Service (Baa2). In determining ourcredit ratings, the rating agencies consider a number of both quantitative and qualitative factors.These factors include earnings, fixed charges such as interest, cash flows, total debt outstanding,off balance sheet obligations and other commitments, total capitalization and various ratioscalculated from these factors. The rating agencies also consider predictability of cash flows,business strategy and diversity, industry conditions and contingencies. Lower ratings on ourcommercial paper program or our senior unsecured debt could impair our ability to obtain additionalfinancing and will increase the cost of the financing that we do obtain.15Table of ContentsTHE AGREEMENTS GOVERNING THE NOTES AND OUR OTHER DEBT CONTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS AND IMPOSERESTRICTIONS ON OUR BUSINESS.     The indenture governing our 6.75% notes due 2009, 5.625% notes due 2013 and 6.50% notesdue 2017 contains restrictions on our ability to create liens, sell assets, enter into sale andleaseback transactions and consolidate or merge. In addition, our credit facility containscovenants that place restrictions on our ability to, among other things:   create liens;    enter into transactions with affiliates;    sell assets;    in the case of some of our subsidiaries, guarantee debt; and    consolidate or merge.     Our credit facility also requires that we meet certain financial tests and maintain certainfinancial ratios, including a maximum debt to capitalization and interest coverage ratios.     Other agreements that we may enter into in the future may contain covenants imposingsignificant restrictions on our business that are similar to, or in addition to, the covenantsunder our existing agreements. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our businessand may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.     Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control,including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. The breach of any of theserestrictions could result in a default under the indenture governing the notes or under our otherdebt agreements. An event of default under our debt agreements would permit some of our lenders todeclare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaidinterest. If we were unable to repay debt to our secured lenders if we incur secured debt in thefuture, these lenders could proceed against the collateral securing that debt. In addition,acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on thenotes.OUR SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS MUST BE AUDITED ANNUALLY AND THE OCCURRENCE OF A MATERIAL WEAKNESSMAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS REPUTATION, CREDIT RATINGS AND PARTICIPATION IN CAPITAL MARKETS     Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act management must now assess the design and functioning of oursystem of financial internal control.

It is reportedthat in calendar year 2005 China became a net exporter of steel, albeit only by 600,000 tons out ofa total estimated production capacity of 349 million tons. China now accounts for approximatelyone third of the worlds raw steel production and one third of the worlds steel consumption.Expansions and contractions in Chinas economy can have major effects on the pricing of not onlythe price of our finished steel products but also many commodities that affect us such as secondarymetals, energy, marine freight rates, steel making supplies such as ferroalloys and graphiteelectrodes and materials we market such as iron ore and coke. Should Chinese demand weaken orChinese steel production be allowed to expand unchecked to the point that it significantly exceedsthe countrys consumption, prices for many of the products that we both sell to and export fromChina may fall causing erosion in our gross margins and subjecting us to possible renegotiation ofcontracts or increases in bad debts. Significant exports from China of steel in the product lineswe manufacture in the United States would cause selling prices in the United States to decline andnegatively impact our gross margins.RAPID AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF METALS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR INDUSTRY.     Prices for most metals in which we deal have experienced large increases and increasedvolatility in recent years.

Marginal industryparticipants or speculators may attempt to participate to an unhealthy extent during a period ofrapid price escalation with a substantial risk of contract default should prices suddenly reverse.Risks of default in contract performance by customers or suppliers as well as a increased risk ofbad debts and customer credit exposure would increase during periods of rapid and substantial pricechanges.EXCESS CAPACITY IN OUR INDUSTRY COULD INCREASE THE LEVEL OF STEEL IMPORTS INTO THE U.S. RESULTINGIN LOWER DOMESTIC PRICES WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SALES, MARGINS AND PROFITABILITY.     Steel-making capacity exceeds demand for steel products in some countries. Rather thanreducing employment by rationalizing capacity with consumption, steel manufacturers in thesecountries (often with local government assistance or subsidies in various forms) havetraditionally periodically exported steel at prices that are significantly below their home marketprices and which may not reflect their costs of production or capital. This supply of imports candecrease the sensitivity of domestic steel prices to increases in demand or our ability to recoverincreased manufacturing costs.OUR INDUSTRY IS AFFECTED BY CYCLICAL AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC FACTORS INCLUDING THE RISK OF A SLOWDOWN IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY OR RECESSION.     Many of our products are commodities subject to cyclical fluctuations in supply and demand inmetal consuming industries. Metals industries have historically been vulnerable to significantdeclines in consumption and product pricing during prolong periods of economic downturn. Arecession in either the United States or the European Union or the public perception that aslowdown or recession may occur, could decrease the demand for our products and adversely affectour business. Our overall financial results will be dependent substantially upon the extent towhich economic conditions in both the United States and the European Union remain strong. Overalleconomic activity has historically been susceptible to declines following periods of rapidlyincreased energy costs or interest rates. A slower expansion or recession will adversely affect ourfinancial results. Our geographic concentration in the southern and southwestern United States aswell as Central Europe, Australia and China exposes us to the local market conditions in theseregions. Economic downturns in these areas or decisions by governments that have an impact on thelevel and pace of overall economic activity could adversely affect our sales and profitability.     Our business supports cyclical industries such as commercial construction, energy, servicecenter, petrochemical and original equipment manufacturing. These industries may experiencesignificant fluctuations in demand for our products based on economic conditions, energy prices,consumer demand and decisions by governments to fund infrastructure projects such as highways,schools, energy plants and airports. Many of these factors are beyond our control. As a result ofthe volatility in the industries we serve, we may have difficulty increasing or maintaining ourlevel of sales or profitability. If the industries we serve suffer a prolonged downturn, then ourbusiness may be adversely affected.     Our industry is characterized by low backlogs, which means that our results of operations arepromptly affected by short-term economic fluctuations.COMPLIANCE WITH AND CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND REMEDIATION REQUIREMENTS COULD RESULT INSUSTANTIALLY INCREASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OPERATING COSTS.     Existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, orfuture laws or regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations andfinancial condition. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is a significant factor inour business. We are subject to local, state, federal and international environmental laws andregulations concerning, among other matters, waste disposal, air emissions, waste and storm watereffluent and disposal and employee health. Our manufacturing and recycling operations producesignificant amounts of by-products, some of which are handled as industrial waste or11Table of Contentshazardous waste. For example, our minimills generate electric arc furnace dust (EAF dust),which the EPA, and other regulatory authorities classify as hazardous waste. EAF dust requiresspecial handling, recycling or disposal.     In addition, the primary feed materials for the shredders operated by our scrap metalrecycling facilities are automobile hulks and obsolete household appliances. Approximately 20% ofthe weight of an automobile hulk consists of unrecyclable material known as shredder fluff. Afterthe segregation of ferrous and saleable non-ferrous metals, shredder fluff remains. We, along withothers in the recycling industry, interpret Federal regulations to require shredder fluff to meetcertain criteria and pass a toxic leaching test to avoid classification as a hazardous waste. Wealso endeavor to remove hazardous contaminants from the feed material prior to shredding. As aresult, we believe the shredder fluff we generate is not normally considered or properly classifiedas hazardous waste. If the laws, regulations or testing methods change with regard to EAF dust orshredder fluff, we may incur additional significant expenditures.     Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws andregulations, legal requirements are changing frequently and are subject to interpretation. Newlaws, regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities, together with uncertaintyregarding adequate pollution control levels, testing and sampling procedures, new pollution controltechnology and cost benefit analysis based on market conditions are all factors that may increaseour future expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. Accordingly, we are unable topredict the ultimate cost of future compliance with these requirements or their effect on ouroperations. We cannot predict whether such costs can be passed on to customers through productprice increases. Competitors in various regions or countries where environmental regulation mightnot be so restrictive, subject to different interpretation or generally not enforced may enjoy acompetitive advantage.     We may also be required to conduct additional clean up at sites where we have alreadyparticipated in remediation efforts or to take remediation action with regard to sites formerlyused in connection with our operations. We may be required to pay for a portion of the costs ofclean up or remediation at sites we never owned or on which we never operated if we are found tohave arranged for treatment or disposal of hazardous substances on the sites.RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMPANYFLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR RELATIVE TO OTHER CURRENCIES MAY ADVERSELYAFFECT OUR BUSINESS.     Fluctuations in the value of the dollar can be expected to affect our business. In particularmajor changes in the rate of exchange of Chinas Renminbi or substantial increases in the value ofthe Euro to the U.S. Dollar could negatively impact our business. A strong U.S. dollar makesimported metal products less expensive, resulting in more imports of steel products into the U.S.by our foreign competitors. Past economic difficulties in Eastern Europe, Asia and Latin Americahave resulted in lower local demand for steel products and have encouraged greater steel exports tothe U.S. at depressed prices. As a result, our products which are made in the U.S., may becomerelatively more expensive as compared to imported steel, which has had and in the future could havea negative impact on our sales, revenues and profitability.     A strong U.S. dollar hampers our international marketing and distribution business. Weak localcurrencies limit the amount of U.S. dollar denominated products that we can import for ourinternational operations and limits our ability to be competitive against local producers sellingin local currencies.OPERATING INTERNATIONALLY CARRIES RISKS AND UNCERTANTIES WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY EFFECT OUR RESULTSOF OPERATIONS.     We have our heaviest concentration of manufacturing operations in the United States but alsohave significant facilities in Europe and Australia. Our marketing and trading offices are locatedin most major markets of the world with our suppliers and our customers located throughout theworld. Our marketing and distribution segment relies on substantial international shipments ofmaterials and products in the ordinary course of its business. Our stability, growth andprofitability are subject to a number of risks inherent in doing business internationally inaddition to the currency exchange risk discussed above, including:  Political, military, terrorist or major pandemic events;   Legal and regulatory requirements or limitations imposed by foreign governments(particularly those with significant steel consumption or steel related productionincluding China, Brazil, Russia and India) including quotas, tariffs or other protectionisttrade barriers, adverse tax law changes, nationalization or currency restrictions;12Table of Contents  Disruptions or delays in shipments caused by customs compliance or government agencies; and   Potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations.WE RELY ON THE AVAILABILITY OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS FOR OUR MINIMILLOPERATIONS. DISRUPTIONS IN DELIVERY OR SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN ENERGY COSTS, INCLUDING CRUDE OILPRICES, COULD ADVERSLY EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.Minimills melt steel scrap in electric arc furnaces and use natural gas to heat steel billets forrolling into finished products. As large consumers of electricity and gas, often the largest inthe geographic area where our minimills are located, we must have dependable delivery ofelectricity and natural gas in order to operate. Accordingly, we are at risk in the event of anenergy disruption. Prolonged black-outs or brown-outs or disruptions caused by natural disasterssuch as hurricanes would substantially disrupt our production. While we have not sufferedprolonged production delays due to our inability to access electricity or natural gas several ofour competitors have experienced such occurrences. Prolonged substantial increases in energy costswould have an adverse effect on the costs of operating our minimills and would negatively impactour gross margins unless we were able to fully pass through the additional expense. Our finishedsteel products are typically delivered by truck. Rapid increases in the price of fuelattributable to increases in crude oil prices will have a negative impact on our costs and many ofour customers financial results which could result in reduced margins and declining demand for ourproducts. Rapid increases in fuel costs may also negatively impact our ability to charter shipsfor international deliveries at anticipated freight rates thereby decreasing our margins on thosetransactions or causing our customers to look for alternative sources.IF WE LOSE THE SERVICES OF KEY EMPLOYEES WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR OPERATIONSAND MEET OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES.     Our future success depends, in large part, on the continued service of our officers and otherkey employees and our ability to continue to attract and retain additional highly qualifiedpersonnel. These employees are integral to our success based on their expertise and knowledge ofour business and products. We compete for such personnel with other companies including public andprivate company competitors who may periodically offer more favorable terms of employment. Whilewe have an employment agreement with our Chief Executive Officer, we typically do not haveemployment agreements with other key employees. The loss or interruption of the services of anumber of our key employees would reduce our ability to effectively manage our operations due tothe fact that we may not be able to find in a timely manner, appropriate replacement personnelshould the need arise.WE HAVE INITIATED IMPLEMENTATION OF ANENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING SYSTEM WHICH, IF NOT EFFECTIVELY MANAGED AND CONTROLLED, COULDTHREATEN THE ACHIEVEMENT OF OPERATION AND FINANCIAL GOALS.     Planning and design of a newenterprise resource planning system commenced in 2006 and will continue through 2007 with phasedimplementation scheduled commencing in 2008.  There are risks that this effort may not result ina successful implementation resulting in resources being inappropriately diverted, untimelycompletion and substantial cost overruns.WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY COMPETING WITH COMPANIES THAT HAVE A LOWER COST STRUCTURE THAN OURS.     We compete with regional, national and foreign manufacturers and traders. Some of thesecompetitors are larger, have greater financial resources and more diverse businesses than us. Someof our foreign competitors may be able to pursue business opportunities without regard for the lawsand regulations with which we must comply, such as environmental regulations. These companies mayhave a lower cost structure, more operating flexibility and consequently they may be able to offerbetter prices and more services than we can. We cannot assure you that we will be able to competesuccessfully with these companies.     Furthermore, over the past several years, many integrated domestic steel producers and scrapmetal recyclers have entered bankruptcy proceedings. The companies that reorganize and emerge frombankruptcy may have a more competitive capital cost structures. In addition, asset sales by thesecompanies during the reorganization process tended to be at depressed prices, enabling somepurchasers to acquire greater capacity at a lower cost.OUR STEEL MINIMILL BUSINESS REQUIRES CONTINUOUS CAPITAL INVESTMENTS THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TOSUSTAIN.     We must make regular substantial capital investments in our steel minimills to lowerproduction costs and remain competitive. We cannot be certain that we will have sufficientinternally generated cash or acceptable external financing to make necessary substantial capitalexpenditures in the future. The availability of external financing depends on many factors outsideof our control, including capital market conditions and the overall performance of the economy. Iffunding is insufficient, we may be unable to develop or enhance our minimills, take advantage ofbusiness opportunities and respond to competitive pressures.13Table of ContentsSCRAP AND OTHER SUPPLIES FOR OUR BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT PRICE FLUCTUATIONS, WHICHMAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.     We depend on ferrous scrap, the primary feedstock for our steel minimills and other suppliessuch as graphite electrodes and ferroalloys for our steel minimill operations. Although we believethat the supply of scrap is adequate to meet future needs, the price of scrap and other supplieshave historically been subject to significant fluctuation. Our future profitability will beadversely affected if we are unable to pass on to our customers increased raw material and suppliescosts. We may not be able to adjust our product prices to recover the costs of rapid increases inmaterial prices, especially over the short-term and in our domestic fabrication segments fixedprice fabrication contracts.     The raw material used in manufacturing copper tubing is copper scrap, supplementedoccasionally by virgin copper ingot. Copper scrap has generally been readily available, and a smallportion of our copper scrap comes from our metal recycling yards. However, copper scrap is subjectto rapid price fluctuations related to the price and supply of virgin copper. Price increases forhigh quality copper scrap could adversely affect our business. Finally, our Arkansas mill does nothave melting capacity, so it is dependent on an adequate supply of competitively priced used rail.The availability of used rail fluctuates with the pace of railroad abandonments, rail replacementby railroads in the United States and abroad and demand for used rail from other domestic andforeign rail rerolling mills. Price increases for used rail could adversely affect our business.UNEXPECTED EQUIPMENT FAILURES MAY LEAD TO PRODUCTION CURTAILMENTS OR SHUTDOWNS.     Interruptions in our production capabilities will adversely affect our production costs, steelavailable for sales and earnings for the affected period. In addition to equipment failures, ourfacilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such asfires, explosions or violent weather conditions. Our manufacturing processes are dependent uponcritical pieces of steel-making equipment, such as our furnaces, continuous casters and rollingequipment, as well as electrical equipment, such as transformers, and this equipment may, onoccasion, be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures. We have experienced and may inthe future experience material plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of suchequipment failures.HEDGING TRANSACTIONS MAY LIMIT OUR POTENTIAL GAINS OR EXPOSE US TO LOSS.     Our product lines and worldwide operations expose us to risks associated with fluctuations inforeign currency exchange, commodity prices and interest rates. As part of our risk managementprogram, we use financial instruments, including commodity futures or forwards, foreign currencyexchange forward contracts and interest rate swaps. While intended to reduce the effects of thefluctuations, these transactions may limit our potential gains or expose us to loss. Should ourcounterparties to such transactions or the sponsors of the exchanges through which thesetransactions are offered, such as the London Metal Exchange, fail to honor their obligations due tofinancial distress we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipatedgains from these transactions.     We enter into the foreign currency exchange forwards as economic hedges of trade commitmentsor anticipated commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency to mitigatethe effects of changes in currency rates. Although we do not enter into these instruments fortrading purposes or speculation, and although our management believes all of these instruments areeconomically effective as hedges of underlying physical transactions, these foreign exchangecommitments are dependent on timely performance by our counterparties. Their failure to performcould result in our having to close these hedges without the anticipated underlying transaction andcould result in losses if foreign currency exchange rates have changed.WE ARE INVOLVED AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BECOME INVOLVED IN VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS THAT MAYRESULT IN FINES, PENALTIES OR JUDGMENTS BEING ASSESSED AGAINST US OR LIABILITY IMPOSED UPON USWHICH WE CANNOT PRESENTLY ESTIMATE OR REASONABLY FORESEE AND WHICH MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ONOUR EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS.     Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, calledCERCLA, or similar state statutes, we may have obligations to conduct investigation and remediationactivities associated with alleged releases of hazardous substances or to reimburse the EPA (orstate agencies as applicable) for such activities and to pay for natural resource damagesassociated with alleged releases. We have been named a potentially responsible party at severalfederal and state Superfund sites because the EPA or an equivalent state agency contends that weand other potentially responsible scrap metal suppliers are liable for the cleanup of those sitesas a result of having sold scrap metal to unrelated manufacturers for recycling as a raw materialin the manufacture of new products. We are involved in litigation or administrative proceedingswith regard to several of these sites in which14Table of Contentswe are contesting, or at the appropriate time may contest, our liability at the sites. Inaddition, we have received information requests with regard to other sites which may be underconsideration by the EPA as potential CERCLA sites.     Although we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure to loss inconnection with various environmental matters or the effect on our consolidated financial position,we make accruals as warranted. Due to inherent uncertainties, including evolving remediationtechnology, changing regulations, possible third-party contributions, the inherent shortcomings ofthe estimation process, the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors, the amounts weaccrue could vary significantly from the amounts we ultimately are required to pay.AN INABILITY TO FULLY AND EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATE FUTURE ACQUISITIONS COULD RESULT IN INCREASED COSTSWHILE DIVERTING MANAGEMENTS ATTENTION FROM OUR CORE OPERATIONS, AND WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WEWILL REALIZE THEIR FULL BENEFITS OR SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR COMBINED COMPANY, AND FUTUREACQUISITIONS MAY RESULT IN DILUTIVE EQUITY ISSUANCES OR INCREASES IN DEBT.     As part of our ongoing business strategy we regularly evaluate and may pursue acquisitions ofand investments in complementary companies. We cannot assure you that we will be able to fully orsuccessfully integrate recent or future acquisitions in a timely manner or at all. If we are unableto successfully integrate acquisitions, we may incur costs and delays or other operational,technical or financial problems, any of which could adversely affect our business. In addition,managements attention may be diverted from core operations which could harm our ability to timelymeet the needs of our customers and damage our relationships with those customers. To financefuture acquisitions, we may need to raise funds either by issuing equity securities or incurring orassuming debt. If we incur additional debt, the related interest expense may significantly reduceour profitability.WE ARE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY.     We are involved in various litigation matters, including regulatory proceedings,administrative proceedings, governmental investigations, environmental matters and constructioncontract disputes. The nature of our operations also expose us to possible litigation claims in thefuture. Although we make every effort to avoid litigation, these matters are not totally within ourcontrol. We will contest these matters vigorously and have made insurance claims where appropriate,but because of the uncertain nature of litigation and coverage decisions, we cannot predict theoutcome of these matters. These matters could have a material adverse effect on our financialcondition and profitability. Litigation is very costly, and the costs associated with prosecutingand defending litigation matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditionand profitability. Although we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount ofexposure to loss in connection with litigation matters, we make accruals as warranted. However, theamounts that we accrue could vary significantly from the amounts we actually pay, due to inherentuncertainties and the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process, the uncertainties involvedin litigation and other factors.SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS MAY DEFAULT ON THE DEBTS THEY OWE TO US.     Economic conditions are not consistent in all the markets we serve. Some areas are still weak,and our customers may struggle to meet their obligations, especially if a significant customer oftheirs defaults. We regularly maintain a substantial amount of accounts receivable  at year endover $1.1 billion. We charged off accounts receivable net of recoveries of $3.8 million during thepast fiscal year and at year end our allowance for collection losses was $16 million. Other factorssuch as management and accounting irregularities have forced some companies into bankruptcy. Aweakening of the general economy and corporate failures could result in higher bad debt costs. Incertain markets we have experienced a consolidation among those entities to whom we sell. Thisconsolidation, along with substantially higher metals and other commodity prices, has resulted inan increased credit risk spread among fewer customers without a corresponding strengthening oftheir financial status. Although we have expanded our use of credit insurance for accountsreceivable in our marketing and distribution segment and require letters of credit from reputablefinancial institutions in many international sales transactions, the majority of our receivables inour other segments are considered to be open account uninsured accounts receivable.CREDIT RATINGS AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN FINANCING AND THE COST OF SUCH FINANCING.     Credit ratings affect our ability to obtain financing and the cost of such financing. Ourcommercial paper program is ranked in the second highest category by Moodys Investors Service(P-2) and Standard & Poors Corporation (A-2). Our senior unsecured debt is investment grade ratedby Standard & Poors Corporation (BBB) and Moodys Investors Service (Baa2). In determining ourcredit ratings, the rating agencies consider a number of both quantitative and qualitative factors.These factors include earnings, fixed charges such as interest, cash flows, total debt outstanding,off balance sheet obligations and other commitments, total capitalization15Table of Contentsand various ratios calculated from these factors. The rating agencies also considerpredictability of cash flows, business strategy and diversity, industry conditions andcontingencies. Lower ratings on our commercial paper program or our senior unsecured debt couldimpair our ability to obtain additional financing and will increase the cost of the financing thatwe do obtain.THE AGREEMENTS GOVERNING THE NOTES AND OUR OTHER DEBT CONTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS AND IMPOSERESTRICTIONS ON OUR BUSINESS.     The indenture governing our 6.80% notes due 2007, 6.75% notes due 2009 and 5.625% notes due2013 contains restrictions on our ability to create liens, sell assets, enter into sale andleaseback transactions and consolidate or merge. In addition, our credit facility containscovenants that place restrictions on our ability to, among other things:  create liens;   enter into transactions with affiliates;   sell assets;   in the case of some of our subsidiaries, guarantee debt; and   consolidate or merge.     Our credit facility also requires that we meet certain financial tests and maintain certainfinancial ratios, including a maximum debt to capitalization and interest coverage ratios.     Although the debt owed by CMCZ under a five-year term note is without recourse to CommercialMetals Company, our Swiss subsidiary that owns the CMCZ shares or any other of our subsidiaries,the note does contain certain covenants including minimum debt to EBITDA, debt to equity andtangible net worth requirements (as defined only by reference to CMCZs financial statements).     Other agreements that we may enter into in the future may contain covenants imposingsignificant restrictions on our business that are similar to, or in addition to, the covenantsunder our existing agreements. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our businessand may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.     Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control,including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. The breach of any of theserestrictions could result in a default under the indenture governing the notes or under our otherdebt agreements. An event of default under our debt agreements would permit some of our lenders todeclare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaidinterest. If we were unable to repay debt to our secured lenders if we incur secured debt in thefuture, these lenders could proceed against the collateral securing that debt. In addition,acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on thenotes.OUR SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS MUST BE AUDITED ANNUALLY AND THE OCCURRENCE OF A MATERIAL WEAKNESSMAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS REPUTATION, CREDIT RATINGS AND PARTICIPATION IN CAPITAL MARKETS     Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act management must now assess the design and functioning of oursystem of financial internal control. Our registered independent accountants must then certifysuch representation. Discovery and disclosure of a material weakness, by definition, may have amaterial adverse impact on our financial statements. Such an occurrence may discourage certaincustomers or suppliers from doing business with us, may cause downgrades in our debt ratingsleading to higher borrowing costs, and may affect how our stock trades. This may in turnnegatively affect our ability to access public debt or equity markets for capital"
