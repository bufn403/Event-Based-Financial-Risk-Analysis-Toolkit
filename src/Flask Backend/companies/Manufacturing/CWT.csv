5,CWT,CALIFORNIA WATER SERVICE GP,2024-02-29,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
.In evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the following discussion of material risks, events, and uncertainties that make an investment in us speculative or risky in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A manifestation of any of the following risks and uncertainties could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, materially and adversely affect our business, growth, reputation, prospects, operating and financial results, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity, and stock price. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors; our operations could also be affected by factors, events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. Therefore, you should not consider the following risks to be a complete statement of all the potential risks or uncertainties that we face.22Table of ContentsRisks Related to Our Regulatory EnvironmentOur business is heavily regulated by state and federal regulatory agencies and our financial viability depends upon our ability to recover costs and investments from our customers through rates that must be approved by state public utility commissions.Cal Water, New Mexico Water, Washington Water, and Hawaii Water are regulated public utilities, which provide water and water-related service to our customers. Additionally, Hawaii Water and Texas Water own in whole or in part other companies which are regulated public utilities. The rates that we charge our water customers are subject to the jurisdiction of the regulatory Commissions in the states in which we operate. These Commissions may set water and water-related rates for each operating district independently because the systems are not interconnected. The Commissions authorize us to charge rates that they consider sufficient to recover normal operating expenses, to provide funds for adding new or replacing water infrastructure, and to allow us the opportunity to earn what the Commissions consider to be a fair and reasonable return on invested capital.Our revenues and consequently our ability to meet our financial objectives are dependent upon the rates we are authorized to charge our customers by the Commissions and our ability to recover our costs in these rates. Our management uses forecasts, models and estimates in order to set rates that we believe will provide a fair and reasonable return on our invested capital. While our rates must be approved by the Commissions, no assurance can be given that our forecasts, models and estimates will be correct or that the Commissions will agree with our forecasts, models, and estimates. If our rates are set too low, our revenues may be insufficient to cover our operating expenses, capital expenditure requirements and desired dividend levels.We periodically file rate increase applications with the Commissions. The ensuing administrative and hearing process may be lengthy and costly. The decisions of the Commissions are beyond our control and we can provide no assurances that our rate increase requests will be granted by the Commissions. Even if approved, there is no guarantee that approval will be given in a timely manner or at a sufficient level to cover our expenses and provide a reasonable return on our investment. If the rate increase decisions are delayed or approved at a level that is lower than what we have requested, our earnings may be adversely affected. For example, the CPUC has not issued its final decision on our 2021 GRC, which has resulted in lower revenues in 2023 and is leading to financial and operating uncertainty for the Company. Our ability to execute on our business strategy is expected to be adversely impacted if the CPUC issues a final decision on our 2021 GRC that results in approving lower rate increases than what we have requested. Our evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets is subject to adjustment by regulatory agencies and any such adjustment could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Regulatory decisions may affect prospective revenues and earnings and the timing of the recognition of revenues and expenses and may overturn past decisions used in determining our revenues and expenses. While our management evaluates the anticipated recovery of regulatory assets and revenues subject to refund and provides for allowances and/or reserves as deemed necessary, no assurance can be given that any such allowances and/or reserves will be adequate to cover any loss or adjustment due to the absence of our limited recovery of regulatory assets and revenues as a result of regulatory decisions. Current accounting procedures allow us to defer certain costs if we believe it is probable that we will be allowed to recover those costs through future rate increases. If the Commissions determined that a portion of our assets were not recoverable in customer rates, we may suffer an asset impairment, which would require a write down in such asset's valuation that would be recorded through operations.If our assessment as to the probability of recovery through the ratemaking process is later determined to be incorrect, the associated regulatory asset would be adjusted to reflect the change in our assessment of any regulatory disallowances. A change in our evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets or a regulatory disallowance of all or a portion of our cost could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.Regulatory agencies may disagree with our valuation and characterization of certain of our assets.If we determine that assets are no longer used or useful for utility operations, we may remove them from our rate base and subsequently sell those assets with any gain on sales accruing to the stockholders, subject to certain conditions. If the Commissions disagree with our characterization, there is a risk that the Commissions could determine that realized appreciation in property value should be awarded to customers rather than our stockholders.23Table of ContentsChanges in laws, rules, and policies of our regulators or operating jurisdictions can significantly affect our business.Regulatory agencies may change their rules and policies for various reasons, including changes in the local political environment. Regulators are elected by popular vote or are appointed by elected officials, and the election of a new administration or the appointment of new officials due to the results of elections may result in dramatic change to the long-established rules and policies of an agency. For example, in 2020 regulation regarding full decoupling WRAMs changed in California. Since 2008, the CPUC allowed full decoupling WRAMs. However, in 2020, the CPUC precluded companies from proposing full decoupling WRAMs in their next GRC filings. As a result, we have been precluded from recording WRAM revenue since the conclusion of the WRAM as of December 31, 2022.We rely on policies and regulations promulgated by the various state commissions in order to recover capital expenditures, maintain favorable treatment on gains from the sale of real property, offset certain production and operating costs, recover the cost of debt, maintain an optimal equity structure without over-leveraging, and have financial and operational flexibility to engage in non-regulated operations. If any of the Commissions with jurisdiction over us implements policies and regulations that do not allow us to accomplish some or all of the items listed above, our future operating results may be adversely affected.In addition, legislatures may repeal, relax or tighten existing laws, or enact new laws that affect the regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over our business or affect our business directly. If changes in existing laws or the implementation of new laws limit our ability to accomplish some of our business objectives, or make accomplishing such objectives more expensive, our future operating results may be adversely affected.Finally, local jurisdictions may impose new ordinances, laws, fees, and regulations that could increase costs or limit our operations, which affect future operating results. Cities may impose or amend franchise requirements, impose conditions on underground construction or land use, impose various taxes and fees, or restrict our hours for construction, among other things. In the last decade, more cities have imposed excavation moratoria or paving rules, which has required more costly construction than anticipated.We expect environmental health and safety regulation to increase, resulting in higher operating costs in the future and the potential that the company fails to meet these regulatory standards.Our water and wastewater services are governed by various federal and state environmental protection, health and safety laws, and regulations. Although we have a water quality assurance program in place, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to comply with all standards. If we violate any federal or state regulations or laws governing health and safety, we could be subject to substantial fines or otherwise sanctioned, subject to potential civil liability for damages, and our customers' trust in our operations ability could be eroded.Environmental health and safety laws are complex and change frequently. They have tended to become more stringent over time. As new or stricter standards are introduced, our operating costs could increase. Although we would likely seek permission to recover these costs through rate increases, we can give no assurance that the Commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs.We are required to test our water quality for certain chemicals and potential contaminants on a regular basis. If the test results indicate that our water exceeds allowable limits, we may be required either to commence treatment to remove the contaminant or to develop an alternate water source. Either of these results may be costly. Although we would likely seek permission to recover these through rate increases, there can be no assurance that the Commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs.Past events in the utility sector, including those in Flint, Michigan and related to Pacific Gas and Electric Company in California, show that failure to meet one or more water quality, environmental, or safety standards can have severe effects on customer trust, reputation, regulatory treatment, or civil and criminal liability.New and/or more stringent water quality regulations could increase our operating costs.We are subject to water quality standards set by federal, state, and local authorities that have the power to issue new regulations. Compliance with new regulations that are more stringent than current regulations could increase our operating costs and capital expenditures, including requirements for increased monitoring, additional treatment of underground water supplies, fluoridation of all supplies, more stringent performance standards for treatment plants, additional procedures to further reduce levels of disinfection by-products, and more comprehensive measures to monitor, reduce or eliminate known or newly identified contaminants. There are currently limited regulatory mechanisms and procedures available to us for the recovery of such costs and there can be no assurance that such costs will be fully recovered and failure to do so may adversely affect our operating results.24Table of ContentsAttention is being given to contaminants of emerging concern, including, without limitation, chemicals and other substances that currently do not have any regulatory standard in drinking water or have been recently created or discovered. We believe these contaminants may form the basis for additional or increased federal or state regulatory initiatives and requirements in the future, which could significantly increase the cost of our operations.For example, while there are currently no federal MCLs or state MCLs in states in which we operate for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) compounds, we continue to closely monitor the regulatory process at state and federal levels, follow recommendations from our regulators, review existing and new treatment methods, and develop a response strategy to help prepare us to meet anticipated MCLs. Currently the federal government has proposed regulations for 6 PFAS compounds.  Where detections of PFAS in our California systems have exceeded the state-established response levels, we have implemented procedures for removing the source from service or installing treatment for PFAS. We also treat several affected water supplies for chromium-6, which experts suggest is harmful to human health and for which the California State Water Resources Control Board is developing a new MCL. To treat chromium-6, we use strong base anion exchange or reduction, coagulation, oxidation, and filtration treatment methods. We began treating water supplies in California for chromium-6 shortly after the state safe drinking water standard was set in 2014, which was subsequently remanded, and we have continued to meet the threshold for affected active water sources as regulations have evolved.While there are no known lead service lines within Cal Water systems, the Revised Lead and Copper Rule from the EPA includes expanded requirements to complete service line inventories on both the water utility's and the customer's side of the water meter to identify lead in drinking water. As part of our compliance strategy for this updated rule, we are currently conducting an inventory to identify potential lead service lines on the customer side of the water meter.Legislation and regulation designed to mitigate or adapt to climate change may affect our operations.Future legislation or regulation regarding climate change may restrict our operations or impose new costs on our business. Our operations depend on power provided by other public utilities and, in emergencies, power generated by our portable and fixed generators. If future legislation or regulation limits emissions from the power generation process, our cost of power may increase. Although any increase in the cost of power would be expected to be passed along to our California customers through the ICBA or included in our cost of service paid by our customers as requested in our GRC filings in California, we can give no assurance that such costs would be passed along to our California customers or that the CPUC would approve rate increases to enable us to recover such expenditures or costs. Legislation and regulation regarding greenhouse gas emissions may also impose new costs on our business. For example, in March 2022, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission proposed climate disclosure rules that would require public companies to significantly increase disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions and strategies, targets, costs and risks associated with climate change and the energy transition. Additionally, in October 2023, California enacted legislation addressing the disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions, climate-related risks, environmental claims, and the use or sale of voluntary carbon offsets. New and future laws and regulations could increase the complexity of and costs associated with compliance with such regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.We have been and may in the future be party to environmental and product-related lawsuits, which could result in us paying damages not covered by insurance.We have been and may be in the future, party to water contamination lawsuits, which may not be fully covered by insurance.The number of environmental and product-related lawsuits against other water utilities has increased in frequency in recent years. If we are subject to additional environmental or product-related lawsuits, we might incur significant legal costs and it is uncertain whether we would be able to recover the legal costs from customers or other third parties. In addition, if current California law regarding CPUC's preemptive jurisdiction over regulated public utilities for claims about compliance with California Department of Health Services and United States EPA water quality standards changes, our legal exposure may be significantly increased.Risks Related to Our Business OperationsWe are at risk for litigation under the principle of inverse condemnation for activities in the normal course of business that are deemed to have a damaging effect on private property.The California constitution may allow compensation to property owners for a public utility taking or damaging private property, even when damage occurs through no fault of the utility and regardless of whether the damage could be foreseen by the utility. As a result, this doctrine, which is known as inverse condemnation and is routinely invoked in California, imposes strict liability for damages, including legal fees, because of the design, construction, maintenance and operation of utility facilities. In addition to claims that our water or wastewater systems damaged property, Cal Water could be sued under inverse 25Table of Contentscondemnation if its facilities or operations damage private property, or if it is unable to timely deliver sufficient quantities of water for firefighting because of system capacity limitations or water supply disruptions, including as a result of action taken by an electric utility pursuant to a PSPS program or other loss of power. Although the imposition of liability is premised on the assumption that utilities have the ability to recover these costs from their customers, there is no assurance that the CPUC would allow Cal Water to recover any such damage awards from customers. For example, in December 2017, the CPUC denied recovery of costs that San Diego Gas & Electric Company incurred because of inverse condemnation, holding that the inverse condemnation principles of strict liability are not relevant to the CPUC's prudent manager standard.The effects of natural disasters, attacks by third parties, or poor water quality or contamination to our water supply may result in disruption in our services and litigation, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.We operate in areas that are prone to earthquakes, fires, mudslides, and other natural disasters. A significant seismic event or other natural disaster in California where our operations are concentrated could adversely affect our ability to deliver water and adversely affect our costs of operations. A major disaster could damage or destroy substantial capital assets. The CPUC has historically allowed utilities to establish a catastrophic event memorandum account as another possible mechanism to recover costs. However, we can give no assurance that the CPUC or any other commission would allow any such cost recovery mechanism in the future.Our water supplies are subject to contamination, including contamination from the development of naturally-occurring compounds, chemicals in groundwater systems, pollution resulting from fabricated sources, such as 1,2,3-Trichloropropane (TCP) and PFAS, seawater incursion, and possible third-party attacks, including physical attacks, terrorist attacks, and cyber-attacks. If our water supply is contaminated, we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water source. In addition, we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities, or development of new treatment methods. If we are unable to substitute water supply from an uncontaminated water source, or if we are unable to adequately treat the contaminated water source in a cost-effective manner, there may be an adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, and financial condition. The costs we incur to decontaminate a water source or an underground water system could be significant and may not be recoverable in rates. We could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances in our water supplies or other environmental damage. For example, private plaintiffs have the right to bring personal injury or other toxic tort claims arising from the presence of hazardous substances in our drinking water supplies. Our insurance policies may not be sufficient to cover the costs of these claims.We have taken steps to increase security measures at our facilities and heighten employee awareness of threats to our water supply, to protect against third-party attacks, including physical attacks, terrorist attacks, and cyber-attacks. We have also improved our security measures regarding the delivery and handling of certain chemicals used in our business. We have and will continue to bear increased costs for security precautions to protect our facilities, operations, and supplies. These costs may be significant. Despite these improved security measures, we may not be able to prevent or deter any third-party attacks or be in a position to control the outcome of third-party attacks should they occur.We depend upon our skilled and trained workforce for water delivery. Actual or threatened public health emergencies, including disease outbreaks, may also lead to the closure of our facilities or to the illness of our employees. We can give no assurance that we will be able to maintain sufficient human resources to provide service in all of the districts that we serve.If any of these catastrophic events were to occur, we can give no assurance that our emergency preparedness plans would be adequate and that we would respond effectively, which could result in public or employee harm or adversely affect our revenues, operating results, and financial condition.Failure of critical elements of our infrastructure could result in interruption of service, damage to others, or injuries, and could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.We own physical infrastructure, which was installed over a long period of time, both underground and above-ground. This infrastructure is subject to potential failure due to age, operating conditions, or other unknown factors. Failure of any of our facilities or infrastructure could cause flooding, loss of service to our customers, contamination from chemicals we use in operations, or other damages.We operate a dam. If the dam were to fail for any reason, we would lose a water supply and flooding likely would occur. Whether or not we were responsible for the dam's failure, we could be sued. We can give no assurance that we would be able to defend such a suit successfully.We operate several water and wastewater treatment plants. If a major failure of these facilities were to occur, we would have an interruption in service, potential flooding, and could release potentially harmful material into the environment.26Table of ContentsWe operate over 7,000 miles of underground pipeline. Some failures of underground pipelines could release disinfection chemicals into the environment, which have a negative impact on sensitive habitats.We rely on our information technology (IT), operational technology (OT), and a number of complex business systems to assist with the management of our business and customer and supplier relationships, and a disruption of these systems, including from cyber-attacks, could adversely affect our business.Our IT and OT systems are an integral part of our business, and a serious disruption of these systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently, which, in turn, could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and adversely affect our results of operations. We rely on our IT and OT networks and applications to bill customers, process orders, provide customer service, manage construction projects, manage our financial records, track assets, remotely monitor certain of our plants and facilities and manage human resources, inventory and accounts receivable collections. Our systems also enable us to purchase products from our suppliers and bill customers on a timely basis, maintain cost-effective operations, and provide service to our customers. Some of our mission and business critical systems are older and the steps we have taken to protect our systems may be insufficient to protect them from damage or interruption from:•power loss, computer systems failures, including hardware equipment and software applications, and internet, telecommunications or data network failures;•operator negligence or improper operation by, or supervision of, employees;•physical and electronic loss of customer data due to security breaches, cyber-attacks, misappropriation, acts of violence, war or terrorism, and similar events;•computer viruses;•intentional security breaches, hacking, denial of services actions, misappropriation of data, and similar events, including intentional cybersecurity breaches aimed at disrupting and interfering with water treatment processes; and•earthquakes, floods, fires, mudslides, and other natural disasters or physical attacks.These events may result in physical and/or electronic loss of customer or financial data; security breaches; misappropriation; disruption of service to our customers; loss of revenues, response costs, and other financial loss; loss of management time, attention, and resources from our regular business operations; damage to our reputation; and other adverse consequences, including liability or regulatory penalties under data privacy laws and regulations. In addition, the lack of redundancy for certain of our IT systems, including billing systems, could exacerbate the impact of any of these events on us, all of which could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, and cash flows. These types of events, either impacting our facilities or the industry in general, could also cause us to incur additional security and insurance related costs. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we collect and retain sensitive information, including personally identifiable information, about our customers, employees, and vendors. In many cases, we outsource the administration of certain functions to vendors that have been and will continue to be targets of cyber-attacks. Any theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer, employee, vendor, or proprietary data as a result of a cyber-attack on us or a vendor could also subject us to significant litigation, liability, and costs, as well as adversely impact our reputation with customers and regulators, among others.In addition, we may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our business, and we might lack sufficient resources to make the necessary upgrades or replacements of our outdated existing technology to allow us to continue to operate at our current level of efficiency, all of which could adversely impact our business and competitive position. We maintain cybersecurity insurance to provide coverage for a portion of the losses and damages that may result from a security breach, but such insurance is subject to a number of exclusions and may not cover the total loss caused by a breach. Other costs associated with cyber events may not be covered by insurance or recoverable in rates. The market for cybersecurity insurance continues to evolve and may affect the future availability of cyber insurance at reasonable rates.The adequacy of our water supplies depends upon a variety of factors beyond our control. Interruption in the water supply may adversely affect our reputation and earnings.We depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and future needs of our customers. Whether we have an adequate supply varies depending upon a variety of factors, many of which are partially or completely beyond our control, including:•the amount of rainfall;•the amount of water stored in reservoirs;27Table of Contents•underground water supply from which well water is pumped;•availability from water wholesalers;•changes in the amount of water used by our customers;•water quality and availability of appropriate treatment technology;•legal limitations on water use such as rationing restrictions during a drought;•changes in prevailing weather patterns and climate; and•population growth.We purchase our water supply from various governmental agencies and others, and, in many areas, purchased water is the only available source of water. Water supply availability may be affected by weather conditions, funding and other political and environmental considerations. In addition, our ability to use surface water is subject to regulations regarding water quality and volume limitations. If new regulations are imposed or existing regulations are changed or given new interpretations, the availability of surface water may be materially reduced. A reduction in surface water could result in the need to procure more costly water from other sources, thereby increasing our water production costs and adversely affecting our operating results if not recovered in rates on a timely basis.We have entered into long-term water supply agreements, which commit us to making certain minimum payments whether or not we purchase any water. Therefore, if demand were insufficient to use our required purchases we would have to pay for water we did not receive.From time to time, we enter into water supply agreements with third parties and our business is dependent upon such agreements in order to meet regional demand. For example, we have entered into a water supply contract with the SFPUC that expires on June 30, 2034. We can give no assurance that the SFPUC, or any of the other parties from whom we purchase water, will renew our contracts upon expiration, or that we will not be subject to significant price increases under any such renewed contracts.The parties from whom we purchase water maintain significant infrastructure and systems to deliver water to us. Maintenance of these facilities is beyond our control. If these facilities are not adequately maintained or if these parties otherwise default on their obligations to supply water to us, we may not have adequate water supplies to meet our customers' needs.If we are unable to access adequate water supplies, we may be unable to satisfy all customer demand, which could result in rationing. Rationing may have an adverse effect on cash flow from operations. We can make no guarantee that we will always have access to an adequate supply of water that will meet all required quality standards. Water shortages may affect us in a variety of ways. For example, shortages could:•adversely affect our supply mix by causing us to rely on more expensive purchased water;•adversely affect operating costs;•increase the risk of contamination to our systems due to our inability to maintain sufficient pressure; and•increase capital expenditures for building pipelines to connect to alternative sources of supply, new wells to replace those that are no longer in service or are otherwise inadequate to meet the needs of our customers and reservoirs and other facilities to conserve or reclaim water.We may or may not be able to recover increased operating and construction costs on a timely basis, or at all, for our regulated systems through the ratemaking process. We can give no assurance, as to whether we may be able to recover certain of these costs from third parties that may be responsible, or potentially responsible, for any groundwater contamination.Our water supplies and other aspects of our operations may be affected by climate change.There is strong scientific consensus that human activity including carbon and methane emissions is impacting many planetary systems such as the heat-trapping capacity of the atmosphere; ocean temperature, circulation, acidity, and volume; weather patterns including the severity and frequency of severe weather events; ambient temperatures; and planetary ice cover. Because scientific investigations have been focused globally, there is tremendous uncertainty over the timing, extent, and types of impacts global climate change may have on our service areas and in our water supplies. Moreover, studies of tree ring data show long periods of drought conditions have occurred prior to significant human impacts in California and prior to our operation. Finally, in the last fifty years, California has experienced at least three severe multi-year droughts. We can give no assurance that any of our plans for water reliability and water shortages, including incorporating projected and potential climate 28Table of Contentschange risks into our water supply planning activities, will be adequate or capable of effectively addressing any droughts or longer periods of drought conditions or other conditions affecting water quality and availability. Immediate physical risks could affect our operations and intensify over time as climate change worsens. More frequent flooding, wildfires, sea level rise, rising or falling groundwater levels, and uneven ground level sinking could damage our assets, including pressurized mains and other pipelines, wells, treatment facilities, and other infrastructure. Wildfires and changes in rainfall may also affect water quality, and both higher temperatures and wildfires can pose risks to employee safety. Farther into the mid-century and late-century horizon, temperature increases may cause declines in snowpack storage, and droughts could decrease surface water supply availability and groundwater recharge while causing increased outdoor demands, which, in each case, could adversely impact our ability to source adequate water supply to meet the needs of our customers.  Additional climate-related risks may influence our approach as we support the transition to a low-carbon economy. Transition risks include changes in the market and consumer demands, such as differences in generational behaviors, shifts in population locations due to different weather patterns, and variations in water needs and customer groups. Regulatory risks, such as emission trading systems and carbon taxes, may also financially affect our business. Additionally, federal and state regulations present requirements for managing water supplies and limiting impacts on local wildlife, while regional plans and legislation may directly affect how we address water issues.We also periodically review the climate change plans of our wholesalers to determine whether alternative supplies may be necessary in the future. However, we can give no assurance that replacement water supplies will be available at a reasonable cost or a cost acceptable to our customers and Commissions.Natural disasters, climate change, economic conditions, and other factors may change the population in our service areas.In the event that some outside factor such as a wildfire, flood, changed climate pattern, actual or threatened public health emergency, or change in the local economy reduces or eliminates our customer base in a service area, or negatively affects the ability of a customer to pay, we could face unrecoverable costs. In those circumstances, the remaining customers might not be able to pay for the operating costs or capital costs of the water system. We may not be able to recover capital costs of property that is no longer used or useful in utility service. We may also encounter an increase in bad debt expense in times of economic difficulty. For example, we experienced an increase in bad debt expense in 2022, which we believe was due to economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we would likely seek permission to recover any such future costs through rate increases on remaining customers or in statewide rates, we can give no assurance that the Commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these costs.Wastewater operations entail significant risks.Wastewater collection and treatment involve many risks associated with damage to the environment, and we anticipate that wastewater collection and treatment will become an increasing significant part of our business. If collection or treatment systems fail or do not operate properly, untreated or partially treated wastewater could discharge onto property or into nearby streams and rivers, causing damage or injury to property, aquatic life, or human life. Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by liabilities resulting from such damage.Demand for our water is subject to various factors and is affected by seasonal fluctuations.Demand for our water during the warmer, dry months is generally greater than during cooler or rainy months due primarily to additional requirements for water in connection with irrigation systems, swimming pools, cooling systems, and other outside water use. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically warmer months, demand will vary with temperature and rainfall levels. If temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal, or if there is more rainfall than normal, the demand for our water may decrease. Under the MWRAM mechanism, lower water usage in our California operations affects our cash flows in the year of usage, but results in higher cash flows in the following years.In addition, governmental restrictions on water usage during drought conditions may result in a decreased demand for our water, even if our water reserves are sufficient to serve our customers during these drought conditions. The Commissions may not allow surcharges to collect lost revenues caused by customers' conservation during a drought. Regardless of whether we may surcharge our customers during a conservation period, they may use less water even after a drought has passed because of conservation patterns developed during the drought. Furthermore, our customers may wish to use recycled water as a substitute for potable water. If rights are granted to others to serve our customers recycled water, there will likely be a decrease in demand for our water.29Table of ContentsFinally, changes in prevailing weather patterns due to climate change may affect customer demand. If increased ambient temperatures affect our service areas, water used for irrigation and cooling may increase. If rainfall patterns change, our customers may change their patterns of water use including the amount of outdoor irrigation and the type of landscape they install. Government agencies may also mandate changes to customer irrigation or landscape patterns in response to changes in weather and climate.Changes in water supply costs affect our operations.The cost to obtain water for delivery to our customers varies depending on the sources of supply, wholesale suppliers' prices, the quality of water required to be treated and the quantity of water produced to fulfill customer water demand. Our source of supply varies among our operating districts. Certain districts obtain all of their supply from wells; some districts purchase all of the supply from wholesale suppliers; and other districts obtain the supply from a combination of wells and wholesale suppliers. A small portion of supply comes from surface sources and is processed through Company-owned water treatment plants. On average, slightly more than half of the water we deliver to our customers is pumped from wells or received from a surface supply with the remainder purchased from wholesale suppliers. Water purchased from suppliers usually costs us more than surface supplied or well pumped water. The cost of purchased water for delivery to customers represented 31.2% of our total operating costs in 2023 and in 2022. Water purchased from suppliers will require renewal of our contracts upon expiration and may result in significant price increases under any such renewed contracts.Wholesale water suppliers may increase their prices for water delivered to us based on factors that affect their operating costs. Purchased water rate increases are beyond our control. In California, our ability to recover increases in the cost of purchased water is expected to change with the adoption of the ICBA, which is pending approval of the 2021 GRC. With this change, actual per-unit purchased water costs are expected to be compared to authorized per-unit purchased water costs, with variances added to or netted against the variances in purchased power and pump taxes being recorded as a cost recovery. The balance in the ICBA is expected to be collected in the future by billing the ICBA accounts receivable balances over future periods, which may have a short-term negative impact on cash flow. Dependency upon adequate supply of electricity, certain chemicals, and third-party suppliers of parts and skilled labor could adversely affect our results of operations.Purchased electrical power is required to operate the wells and pumps needed to supply water to our customers. Although there are back-up power generators to operate a number of wells and pumps in emergencies, an extended interruption in power could affect the ability to supply water. In the past, California has been subject to rolling power blackouts due to insufficient power supplies. There is no assurance we will not be subject to power blackouts in the future. Additionally, we require sufficient amounts of certain chemicals in order to treat the water we supply. There are multiple sources for these chemicals but an extended interruption of supply could adversely affect our ability to adequately treat our water.Purchased power is a significant operating expense. During 2023 and 2022, purchased power expense represented 6.4% and 6.2%, respectively, of our total operating costs. These costs are beyond our control and can change unpredictably and substantially. As with purchased water, purchased power costs are expected to be included in the ICBA. Cash flows between rate filings may be adversely affected until the Commission authorizes a rate change, but earnings will be minimally impacted. Cost of chemicals used in the delivery of water is not an element of the ICBA, and therefore, variances in quantity or cost could affect the results of operations.We rely on outside contractors to supply us with materials and parts critical to the operation of our systems. Should parts and material become unavailable, or should the cost of necessary supplies rise substantially, it could adversely affect our ability to operate or have financial effects that are not recoverable through a regulatory process.We also rely on outside contractors to complete large construction projects and provide emergency maintenance services. In the event these contractors are unavailable or cannot meet the demands imposed on them, we may face significantly lengthy interruptions of service or delays in constructing capital projects. We may face additional costs to acquire more resources to complete these activities. Our business requires significant capital expenditures to replace or improve aging infrastructure that are dependent on our ability to secure appropriate funding. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital or if the rates at which we borrow increase, there would be a negative impact on our results of operations.The water utility business is capital-intensive. We invest significant funds to replace or improve aging infrastructure such as property, plant, and equipment. In addition, water shortages may adversely affect us by causing us to rely on more purchased water. This could cause increases in capital expenditures needed to build pipelines to secure alternative water sources. In addition, we require capital to grow our business through acquisitions. We fund our capital requirements from cash received from operations, from funds received from developers, by raising equity through common stock issuances or by issuing debt 30Table of Contentsobligations. We cannot give any assurance that these sources will continue to be adequate or that the cost of funds will remain at levels permitting us to earn a reasonable rate of return. In the event we are unable to obtain sufficient capital, our expansion efforts could be curtailed, which may affect our growth and may affect our future results of operations.Our ability to access the capital markets is affected by the ratings of certain of our debt securities. Standard & Poor's Rating Agency issues a rating on California Water Service Company's ability to repay certain debt obligations. The credit rating agency could downgrade our credit rating based on reviews of our financial performance and projections or upon the occurrence of other events that could affect our business outlook. Lower ratings by the agency could restrict our ability to access equity and debt capital. We can give no assurance that the rating agency will maintain ratings that allow us to borrow under advantageous conditions and at reasonable interest rates. A future downgrade by the agency could also increase our cost of capital by causing potential investors to require a higher interest rate due to a perceived risk related to our ability to repay outstanding debt obligations.While the majority of our debt is long term at fixed rates, we do have interest rate exposure in our short-term borrowings, which have variable interest rates. We are also subject to interest rate risks on new financings. However, if interest rates were to increase on a long-term basis, our management believes that customer rates would increase accordingly, subject to approval by the appropriate commission. We can give no assurance that the Commission would approve such an increase in customer rates.We are obligated to comply with specified debt covenants under certain of our loan and debt agreements. Failure to maintain compliance with these covenants could limit future borrowing, and we could face increased borrowing costs, litigation, acceleration of maturity schedules, and cross default issues. Such actions by our creditors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Our inability to access the capital or financial markets could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to meet long-term commitments. Changes in economic conditions in our markets could affect our customers' ability to pay for water services. Any of these could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.We rely on our current credit facilities to fund short-term liquidity needs if internal funds are not available from operations. Specifically, given the seasonal fluctuations in demand for our water we commonly draw on our credit facilities to meet our cash requirements at times in the year when demand is relatively low. We also may occasionally use letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facilities. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to draw on our credit facilities. Our access to funds under our credit facilities is dependent on the ability of our banks to meet their funding commitments.Many of our customers and suppliers also have exposure to risks that could affect their ability to meet payment and supply commitments. We operate in geographic areas that may be particularly susceptible to declines in the price of real property, which could result in significant declines in demand for our products and services. In the event that any of our significant customers or suppliers, or a significant number of smaller customers and suppliers, are adversely affected by these risks, we may face disruptions in supply, significant reductions in demand for our products and services, inability of customers to pay invoices when due, and other adverse effects that could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.Our operations and certain contracts for water distribution and treatment depend on the financial capability of state and local governments, and other municipal entities such as water districts. Major disruptions in the financial strength or operations of such entities, such as liquidity limitations, bankruptcy or insolvency, could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business and/or enforce our rights under contracts to which such entities are a party.We are a holding company that depends on cash flow from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock.As a holding company, we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries and our only significant assets are investments in those subsidiaries. In 2023, 90.6% of our total consolidated operating revenue was derived from the operations of California Water Service Company. As a result, we are dependent on cash flow from our subsidiaries, and California Water Service Company in particular, to meet our obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock.Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and generally have no obligation to pay any amounts due on California Water Service Group's debt or to provide California Water Service Group with funds for dividends. Although there are no contractual or regulatory restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us, the reasonableness of our capital structure is one of the factors considered by state and local regulatory agencies in their ratemaking determinations. Therefore, transfer of funds from our subsidiaries to us for the payment of our obligations or dividends may have an adverse effect on ratemaking determinations. Furthermore, our right to receive cash or other assets upon the liquidation or 31Table of Contentsreorganization of a subsidiary is generally subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary. If we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries in a timely manner, we may be unable to meet our obligations or pay dividends.We can make dividend payments only from our surplus (the excess, if any, of our net assets over total paid-in capital) or if there is no surplus, the net profits for the current fiscal year or the fiscal year before which the dividend is declared. In addition, we can pay cash dividends only if after paying those dividends we would be able to pay our liabilities as they become due. Owners of our capital stock cannot force us to pay dividends and dividends will only be paid if and when declared by our board of directors (Board). Our Board can elect at any time, and for an indefinite duration, not to declare dividends on our capital stock.An important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems. Risks associated with potential acquisitions, divestitures or restructurings may adversely affect us.We seek to acquire or invest in other companies, technologies, services, or products that complement our business from time to time. The execution of our growth strategy exposes us to different risks than those associated with our utility operations. We can give no assurance that we will succeed in finding attractive acquisition candidates or investments, or that we would be able to reach mutually agreeable terms with such parties. In addition, as consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water and wastewater industries, the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase to unacceptable levels and limit our ability to grow through acquisitions. If we are unable to find acquisition candidates or investments, our ability to grow may be limited.Acquisition and investment transactions may result in the issuance of our equity securities that could be dilutive if the acquisition or business opportunity does not develop in accordance with our business plan. They may also result in significant write-offs and an increase in our debt. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Any of these transactions could involve numerous additional risks, including one or more of the following:•problems integrating the acquired operations, personnel, technologies, physical and cybersecurity processes, or products with our existing businesses and products;•liabilities inherited from the acquired companies' prior business operations;•diversion of management time and attention from our core business to the acquired business;•failure to retain key technical, management, and other personnel of the acquired business;•difficulty in retaining relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired business; and•difficulty in obtaining required regulatory approvals.In addition, the businesses and other assets we acquire may not achieve the sales and profitability expected. The occurrence of one or more of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these or any other significant risks encountered.We may not be able to increase or sustain our recent growth rate, and we may not be able to manage our future growth effectively.We may be unable to continue to expand our business or manage future growth. To successfully manage our growth and handle the responsibilities of being a public company, we must effectively:•hire, train, integrate, and manage additional qualified engineers for engineering design and construction activities, new business personnel, and financial and information technology personnel;•retain key management, augment our management team, and retain qualified and certified water and wastewater system operators;•implement and improve additional and existing administrative, financial and operations systems, procedures and controls;•expand our technological capabilities; and•manage multiple relationships with our customers, regulators, suppliers, and other third parties.If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities, satisfy customer requirements, execute our business plan, or respond to competitive pressures.32Table of ContentsWe have a number of large-volume commercial and industrial customers and a significant decrease in consumption by one or more of these customers could have an adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows.Our billed revenues and cash flows from operations will decrease if a significant business or industrial customer terminates or materially reduces its use of our water. Approximately $187.1 million, or 23.7%, of our 2023 water utility revenues was derived from business and industrial customers. In Hawaii, we serve a number of large resorts, which if their water usage was reduced or ceased could have a material impact to our Hawaii operation. The delay between such date and the effective date of the rate relief may be significant and could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.Our operating cost and costs of providing services may rise faster than our revenues.Our ability to increase rates over time is dependent upon approval of such rate increases by the Commissions, or in the case of the City of Hawthorne and the City of Commerce, the City Council, which may be inclined, for political or other reasons, to limit rate increases. However, our costs, which are subject to market conditions and other factors, may increase significantly. The second largest component of our operating costs after water production is made up of salaries and wages. These costs are affected by the local supply and demand for qualified labor. Other large components of our costs are general insurance, workers compensation insurance, employee benefits, and health insurance costs. These costs may increase disproportionately to rate increases authorized by the Commissions and may have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.Demand for our stock may fluctuate due to circumstances beyond our control.We believe that stockholders invest in public utility stocks, in part, because they seek reliable dividend payments. If there is an over-supply of stock of public utilities in the market relative to demand by such investors, the trading price of our securities could decrease. Additionally, if interest rates rise above the dividend yield offered by our equity securities, demand for our stock, and consequently its market price, may decrease. Additional factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our stock include regulatory developments, such as the CPUC's ultimate decision regarding the 2021 GRC; general economic conditions and trends, including inflationary pressures, general economic slowdown or a recession, changes in monetary policy, adverse capital markets activity or macroeconomic conditions as a result of geopolitical conflicts, and the prospect of a shutdown of the U.S. federal government; price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market; actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations; actual or anticipated changes in the expectations of investors or securities analysts; actual or anticipated developments in other utilities' businesses or the competitive landscape generally; litigation involving us or our industry; major catastrophic events, or sales of large blocks of our stock. A decline in demand for our stock may have a negative impact on our ability to finance capital projects.Adverse investment returns and other factors may increase our pension liability and pension funding requirements.A substantial number of our employees are covered by a defined benefit pension plan. At present, the pension plan is underfunded because our projected pension benefit obligation exceeds the aggregate fair value of plan assets. Under applicable law, we are required to make cash contributions to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding levels imposed by regulatory requirements. The amount of such required cash contribution is based on an actuarial valuation of the plan. The funded status of the plan can be affected by investment returns on plan assets, discount rates, mortality rates of plan participants, pension reform legislation, and a number of other factors. There can be no assurance that the value of our pension plan assets will be sufficient to cover future liabilities. Although we contributed to our pension plan in recent years, it is possible that we could incur a pension liability adjustment, or could be required to make additional cash contributions to our pension plan, which would reduce the cash available for business and other needs.Labor relations matters could adversely affect our operating results.At December 31, 2023, 757 of our 1,266 total employees were union employees. Most of our unionized employees are represented by the UWUA, AFL-CIO, except certain engineering and laboratory employees who are represented by the IFPTE, AFL-CIO.We believe our labor relations are good, but in light of rising costs for health care, pensions, and general inflation, our future contract negotiations may be difficult. Furthermore, changes in applicable law or regulations could have an adverse effect on management's negotiating position with respect to our currently unionized employees and/or employees that decide to unionize in the future. We are subject to a risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters as we negotiate with the unions to address these issues, which could affect our results of operations and financial condition. We can give no assurance that issues with our labor forces will be resolved favorably to us in the future or that we will not experience work stoppages.33Table of ContentsOur operations are geographically concentrated in California and this lack of diversification may negatively affect our operating results.Although we own facilities in a number of states, 90.6% of our total consolidated operating revenue was generated by our operations located in California in 2023. As a result, we are largely subject to political, regulatory, economic, water supply, weather, labor, and energy cost risks affecting California.We are also affected by the real property market in California. In order to grow our business, we may need to acquire additional real estate or rights to use real property owned by third parties, the cost of which tends to be higher and more volatile in California than in other states. The value of our assets in California may decline if there is a decline in the California real estate market that results in a significant decrease in real property values.Our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by high inflation and other macroeconomic conditions.Inflation has the potential to adversely affect our liquidity, business, financial condition, and results of operations by increasing our overall cost structure, particularly if we are unable to achieve increases in the rates we charge our customers. There is no guarantee that any future rate increase requests will be approved and granted in a timely manner and/or will be sufficient to cover costs for the impact of high inflation. The existence of inflation in the economy has resulted in, and may continue to result in, higher interest rates and capital costs, shipping costs, supply shortages, increased costs of labor, and other similar effects. As a result of inflation, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, cost increases. Although we may take measures to mitigate the impact of this inflation, if these measures are not effective, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. Even if such measures are effective, there could be a difference between the timing of when these beneficial actions impact our results of operations and when the cost of inflation is incurred. We may also be similarly impacted by stagnating or worsening business and economic conditions, including general economic slowdown or a recession, higher interest rates for a prolonged period of time, instability of certain financial institutions, changes in monetary policy, adverse capital markets activity or macroeconomic conditions as a result of geopolitical conflicts, and the prospect of a shutdown of the U.S. federal government.Municipalities, water districts, and other public agencies may condemn our property by eminent domain action.State statutes allow municipalities, water districts and other public agencies to own and operate water systems. These agencies are empowered to condemn water systems or real property owned by privately owned public utilities in certain circumstances and in compliance with California and federal law. Additionally, whenever a public agency constructs facilities to extend its utility system into the service area of a privately owned public utility, such an act may constitute the taking of property and require reimbursement to the public utility for its loss. If a public agency were to file an eminent domain lawsuit against us, we would incur substantial attorney's fees, consultant and expert fees, and other costs in considering a challenge to the right to take our utility property and/or its valuation for just compensation, as well as such fees and costs in any subsequent litigation if necessary. If the public agency prevailed and acquired our utility property, we would be entitled to just compensation for our loss, but we would no longer have access to the condemned property or water system. Neither would we be entitled to any portion of revenue generated from the use of such asset going forward.General Risk Factors
We depend significantly on the services of the members of our management team, and the departure of any of those persons could cause our operating results to suffer.Our success depends significantly on the continued individual and collective contributions of our management team. The loss of the services of any member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business as our management team has knowledge of our industry and customers and would be difficult to replace.34Table of ContentsWe retain certain risks not covered by our insurance policies.We evaluate our risks and insurance coverage annually or more frequently if circumstances dictate. Our evaluation considers the costs, risks, and benefits of retaining versus insuring various risks as well as the availability of certain types of insurance coverage. Accordingly, we have determined or may determine to self-insure or to not obtain insurance in certain cases, or insurance may not be available at commercially acceptable terms or at all. Furthermore, we are also affected by increases in prices for insurance coverage; in particular, we have been, and will continue to be, affected by rising health insurance costs. Retained risks are associated with deductible limits, partial self-insurance programs, and insurance policy coverage ceilings. If we suffer an uninsured loss, we may be unable to pass all or any portion of the loss on to customers, because our rates are regulated by regulatory commissions. Consequently, uninsured losses may negatively affect our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will not face uninsured losses pertaining to the risks we have retained.Our enterprise risk management processes may not be effective in identifying and mitigating the risks to which we are subject, or in reducing the potential for losses in connection with such risks.Our enterprise risk management processes are designed to minimize or mitigate the risks to which we are subject, as well as any losses stemming from such risks. Although we seek to identify, measure, monitor, report, and control our exposure to such risks, and employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques in the process, those techniques are inherently limited in their ability to anticipate the existence or development of risks that are currently unknown and unanticipated. The ineffectiveness of our enterprise risk management processes in mitigating the impact of known risks or the emergence of previously unknown or unanticipated risks may result in our incurring losses in the future that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.The accuracy of our judgments and estimates about financial and accounting matters will affect our operating results and financial condition.We make certain estimates and judgments in preparing our financial statements regarding, among others:•the useful life of intangible rights;•the number of years to depreciate certain assets;•amounts to set aside for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory obsolescence, and uninsured losses;•our legal exposure and the appropriate accrual for claims, including medical claims and workers' compensation claims;•future costs and assumptions for pensions and other postretirement benefits;•regulatory recovery of regulatory assets;•possible tax uncertainties; and•projected collections of WRAM and MCBA receivables or receivables under subsequent recovery mechanisms, such as MWRAM and ICBA.The quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments may have an impact on our operating results and financial condition.In addition, we must estimate unbilled revenues and costs as of the end of each accounting period. If our estimates are not accurate, we would be required to make an adjustment in a future period. Accounting rules permit us to use expense balancing accounts and memorandum accounts that include cost changes to us that are different from amounts incorporated into the rates approved by the Commissions. These accounts result in expenses and revenues being recognized in periods other than in which they occurred.Our commitments and stakeholder expectations relating to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations may expose us to liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on our business.We have announced, and may from time to time announce, certain initiatives, including goals, targets, and other objectives, related to ESG matters. These statements reflect our current plans and do not constitute a guarantee that they will be achieved. Our failure to accomplish or accurately track and report on these goals on a timely basis, or at all, could adversely affect our reputation, financial performance, and growth, and expose us to increased scrutiny from the investment community as well as enforcement authorities. In addition, statements about our sustainability goals, targets, and other objectives, and progress against those goals, targets, and other objectives, are or may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still 35Table of Contentsdeveloping, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. Our selection of voluntary disclosure frameworks and standards, and the interpretation or application of those frameworks and standards, have changed and may change from time to time, or differ from those of others. Methodologies for reporting this data have been and may from time to time be updated and previously reported data has been or may be adjusted, as applicable, to reflect improvement in availability and quality of third-party data, changing assumptions, changes in the nature and scope of our operations, and other changes in circumstances, which could result in significant revisions to our current goals, reported progress in achieving such goals, or ability to achieve such goals in the future.Investor and political advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, other market participants, stockholders, and customers have focused increasingly on ESG initiatives, including the goals, targets, and objectives that we announce, and our methodologies and timelines for pursuing them. At the same time, stakeholders and regulators have increasingly expressed or pursued opposing views, legislation, and investment expectations with respect to sustainability initiatives, including the enactment or proposal of ""anti-ESG"" legislation or policies. Implementing our ESG programs involves risks and uncertainties, including increased costs, requires investments and often depends on third-party performance or data that is outside our control. For example, as a regulated utility, we must obtain approval from our state utilities commissions for our cost structure and capital investments, including capital expenditures for implementing ESG programs, and any changes that may affect customer rates need to be approved within the rate case process with the state public utilities commissions. In our experience, U.S. state utilities commissions have prioritized water affordability and physical climate change risk adaptation over emissions reductions. Additionally, in many areas, purchased water, which is a contributor to our emissions inventory, is the only available water source, and a large majority of these single-source suppliers have not published emission reduction targets. We cannot guarantee that we will achieve our announced ESG targets and commitments, satisfy all stakeholder expectations, or that the benefits of implementing or achieving these goals and initiatives will not surpass their projected costs. Any failure, or perceived failure, to achieve ESG goals and initiatives, as well as to manage ESG risks, adhere to public statements, comply with federal or state ESG laws and regulations or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against us and materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price. Even if we achieve our goals, targets, and objectives, we may not realize all of the benefits that we expected at the time they were established.Our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable laws and regulations could be impaired by a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, which could result in loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and materially adversely affect our results of operations and stock price.The accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls. We are required to provide a report from management to our stockholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls. As disclosed in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2022 due to a material weakness in our internal control over the completeness of our accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities, specifically controls over the identification of regulatory filings by the Company during the period that are then reviewed to determine their potential accounting impact. This material weakness has since been remediated.Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, and fraud. Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, we could suffer harm to our reputation, incur incremental compliance costs, fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis, be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations, or be required to restate our financial statements, which could result in loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses, and our results of operations and our stock price could be materially adversely affected"
11,CWT,CALIFORNIA WATER SERVICE GP,2023-03-01,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
.In evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the following discussion of material risks, events and uncertainties that make an investment in us speculative or risky in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A manifestation of any of the following risks and uncertainties could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, materially and adversely affect our business, growth, reputation, prospects, operating and financial results, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity, and stock price. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors; our operations could also be affected by factors, events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. Therefore, you should not consider the following risks to be a complete statement of all the potential risks or uncertainties that we face.21Table of ContentsRisks Related to Our Regulatory EnvironmentOur business is heavily regulated by state and federal regulatory agencies and our financial viability depends upon our ability to recover costs from our customers through rates that must be approved by state public utility commissions.California Water Service Company, New Mexico Water Service Company, Washington Water Service Company, and Hawaii Water Service Company, Inc. are regulated public utilities, which provide water and water-related service to our customers. Additionally, Hawaii Water Service Company, Inc. and TWSC, Inc. own in whole or in part other companies which are regulated public utilities. The rates that we charge our water customers are subject to the jurisdiction of the regulatory Commissions in the states in which we operate. These Commissions may set water and water-related rates for each operating district independently because the systems are not interconnected. The Commissions authorize us to charge rates that they consider sufficient to recover normal operating expenses, to provide funds for adding new or replacing water infrastructure, and to allow us to earn what the Commissions consider to be a fair and reasonable return on invested capital.Our revenues and consequently our ability to meet our financial objectives are dependent upon the rates we are authorized to charge our customers by the Commissions and our ability to recover our costs in these rates. Our management uses forecasts, models and estimates in order to set rates that we believe will provide a fair and reasonable return on our invested capital. While our rates must be approved by the Commissions, no assurance can be given that our forecasts, models and estimates will be correct or that the Commissions will agree with our forecasts, models and estimates. If our rates are set too low, our revenues may be insufficient to cover our operating expenses, capital expenditure requirements and desired dividend levels.We periodically file rate increase applications with the Commissions. The ensuing administrative and hearing process may be lengthy and costly. The decisions of the Commissions are beyond our control and we can provide no assurances that our rate increase requests will be granted by the Commissions. Even if approved, there is no guarantee that approval will be given in a timely manner or at a sufficient level to cover our expenses and provide a reasonable return on our investment. If the rate increase decisions are delayed, our earnings may be adversely affected. For example, the CPUC did not issue its decision on our 2018 GRC until December 2020, approximately one year later than expected, which caused some financial and operating uncertainty for the Company until that time.Our evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets is subject to adjustment by regulatory agencies and any such adjustment could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Regulatory decisions may affect prospective revenues and earnings, affect the timing of the recognition of revenues and expenses and may overturn past decisions used in determining our revenues and expenses. While, our management continually evaluates the anticipated recovery of regulatory assets and revenues subject to refund and provides for allowances and/or reserves as deemed necessary, no assurance can be given that any such allowances and/or reserves will be adequate to cover any loss or adjustment due to the absence of our limited recovery of regulatory assets and revenues as a result of regulatory decisions. Current accounting procedures allow us to defer certain costs if we believe it is probable that we will be allowed to recover those costs through future rate increases. If the Commissions determined that a portion of our assets were not recoverable in customer rates, we may suffer an asset impairment, which would require a write down in such asset's valuation that would be recorded through operations.If our assessment as to the probability of recovery through the ratemaking process is later determined to be incorrect, the associated regulatory asset would be adjusted to reflect the change in our assessment or any regulatory disallowances. A change in our evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets or a regulatory disallowance of all or a portion of our cost could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.Regulatory agencies may disagree with our valuation and characterization of certain of our assets.If we determine that assets are no longer used or useful for utility operations, we may remove them from our rate base and subsequently sell those assets with any gain on sales accruing to the stockholders, subject to certain conditions. If the Commissions disagree with our characterization, there is a risk that the Commissions could determine that realized appreciation in property value should be awarded to customers rather than our stockholders.22Table of ContentsChanges in laws, rules, and policies of our regulators or operating jurisdictions can significantly affect our business.Regulatory agencies may change their rules and policies for various reasons, including changes in the local political environment. Regulators are elected by popular vote or are appointed by elected officials, and the election of a new administration or the appointment of new officials due to the results of elections may result in dramatic change to the long-established rules and policies of an agency. For example, in 2020 regulation regarding full decoupling WRAMs changed in California. Since 2008, the CPUC allowed full decoupling WRAMs. However, in 2020, the CPUC precluded companies from proposing full decoupling WRAMs in their next GRC filings. The decision by the CPUC to change its policy began to affect our business in 2023.We rely on policies and regulations promulgated by the various state commissions in order to recover capital expenditures, maintain favorable treatment on gains from the sale of real property, offset certain production and operating costs, recover the cost of debt, maintain an optimal equity structure without over-leveraging, and have financial and operational flexibility to engage in non-regulated operations. If any of the Commissions with jurisdiction over us implements policies and regulations that do not allow us to accomplish some or all of the items listed above, our future operating results may be adversely affected.In addition, legislatures may repeal, relax or tighten existing laws, or enact new laws that affect the regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over our business or affect our business directly. If changes in existing laws or the implementation of new laws limit our ability to accomplish some of our business objectives, our future operating results may be adversely affected.Finally, local jurisdictions may impose new ordinances, laws, fees, and regulations that could increase costs or limit our operations in ways, which affect future operating results. Cities may impose or amend franchise requirements, impose conditions on underground construction or land use, impose various taxes and fees, or restrict our hours for construction, among other things. In the last decade, more cities have imposed excavation moratoria or paving rules, which has required more costly construction than anticipated.We expect environmental health and safety regulation to increase, resulting in higher operating costs in the future and the potential that the company fails to meet these regulatory standards.Our water and wastewater services are governed by various federal and state environmental protection, health and safety laws, and regulations. Although we have a water quality assurance program in place, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to comply with all standards. If we violate any federal or state regulations or laws governing health and safety, we could be subject to substantial fines or otherwise sanctioned, subject to potential civil liability for damages, and our customers' trust in our operations ability could be eroded.Environmental health and safety laws are complex and change frequently. They have tended to become more stringent over time. As new or stricter standards are introduced, they could increase our operating costs. Although we would likely seek permission to recover these costs through rate increases, we can give no assurance that the Commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs.We are required to test our water quality for certain chemicals and potential contaminants on a regular basis. If the test results indicate that our water exceeds allowable limits, we may be required either to commence treatment to remove the contaminant or to develop an alternate water source. Either of these results may be costly. Although we would likely seek permission to recover these through rate increases, there can be no assurance that the Commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs.Past events in the utility sector, including those in Flint, Michigan and related to Pacific Gas and Electric Company in California, show that failure to meet one or more water quality, environmental, or safety standards can have severe effects on customer trust, reputation, regulatory treatment, or civil and criminal liability.New and/or more stringent water quality regulations could increase our operating costs.We are subject to water quality standards set by federal, state, and local authorities that have the power to issue new regulations. Compliance with new regulations that are more stringent than current regulations could increase our operating costs. In August of 2009, the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment within the California Environmental Protection Agency changed the water quality standard for TCP in our water supply. The standard implemented requires us to have 0.0007 parts per billion or less of TCP in our California water supply. We have incurred costs associated with the compliance of this TCP standard and expect to continue to incur costs in the future. Although we would likely seek permission to recover these additional costs through the GRC process, we can give no assurance that the CPUC would approve the recovery of these additional compliance costs.23Table of ContentsPerfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are two water contaminants of emerging concern. Although a water quality standard has yet to be set by federal or state regulators, preliminary testing, and guidance from the California Environmental Protection Agency has affected our operations of some wells in California. We expect that a water quality standard will be set in the future and that we will incur costs to comply with the water quality standard. Cal Water has requested and been approved to use a memorandum account to track the incremental compliance costs in the future and we would likely seek permission to recover additional costs of compliance through rate increases; however, we can give no assurance that the CPUC would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs.Legislation and regulation designed to mitigate or adapt to climate change may affect our operations.Future legislation or regulation regarding climate change may restrict our operations or impose new costs on our business. Our operations depend on power provided by other public utilities and, in emergencies, power generated by our portable and fixed generators. If future legislation or regulation limits emissions from the power generation process, our cost of power may increase. Although any increase in the cost of power would be expected to be passed along to our California customers through the ICBA or included in our cost of service paid by our customers as requested in our GRC filings in California, we can give no assurance that such costs would be passed along to our California customers or that the CPUC would approve rate increases to enable us to recover such expenditures or costs. We have been and may in the future be party to environmental and product-related lawsuits, which could result in us paying damages not covered by insurance.We have been and may be in the future, party to water contamination lawsuits, which may not be fully covered by insurance.The number of environmental and product-related lawsuits against other water utilities has increased in frequency in recent years. If we are subject to additional environmental or product-related lawsuits, we might incur significant legal costs and it is uncertain whether we would be able to recover the legal costs from customers or other third parties. In addition, if current California law regarding CPUC's preemptive jurisdiction over regulated public utilities for claims about compliance with California Department of Health Services and United States EPA water quality standards changes, our legal exposure may be significantly increased.Risks Related to Our Business OperationsWe may be at risk for litigation under the principle of inverse condemnation for activities in the normal course of business, which have a damaging effect on private property.The California constitution may allow compensation to property owners for a public utility taking or damaging private property, even when damage occurs through no fault of the utility and regardless of whether the damage could be foreseen by the utility. As a result, this doctrine, which is known as inverse condemnation and is routinely invoked in California, imposes strict liability for damages, including legal fees, because of the design, construction, and maintenance of utility facilities. In addition to claims that our water or wastewater systems damaged property, Cal Water could be sued under inverse condemnation if its facilities or operations damage private property, or if it is unable to timely deliver sufficient quantities of water for firefighting because of system capacity limitations or water supply disruptions, including as a result of action taken by an electric utility pursuant to a PSPS program or other loss of power. Although the imposition of liability is premised on the assumption that utilities have the ability to recover these costs from their customers, there is no assurance that the CPUC would allow Cal Water to recover any such damage awards from customers. For example, in December 2017, the CPUC denied recovery of costs that San Diego Gas & Electric Company incurred because of inverse condemnation, holding that the inverse condemnation principles of strict liability are not relevant to the CPUC’s prudent manager standard.The effects of natural disasters, attacks by third parties, pandemics, or poor water quality or contamination to our water supply may result in disruption in our services and litigation, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.We operate in areas that are prone to earthquakes, fires, mudslides and other natural disasters. A significant seismic event or other natural disaster in California where our operations are concentrated could adversely affect our ability to deliver water and adversely affect our costs of operations. A major disaster could damage or destroy substantial capital assets. The CPUC has historically allowed utilities to establish a catastrophic event memorandum account as another possible mechanism to recover costs. However, we can give no assurance that the CPUC or any other commission would allow any such cost recovery mechanism in the future.24Table of ContentsOur water supplies are subject to contamination, including contamination from the development of naturally-occurring compounds, chemicals in groundwater systems, pollution resulting from fabricated sources, such as TCP, seawater incursion and possible third-party attacks, including physical attacks, terrorist attacks, and cyber-attacks. If our water supply is contaminated, we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water source. In addition, we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities, or development of new treatment methods. If we are unable to substitute water supply from an uncontaminated water source, or if we are unable to adequately treat the contaminated water source in a cost-effective manner, there may be an adverse effect on our revenues, operating results and financial condition. The costs we incur to decontaminate a water source or an underground water system could be significant and may not be recoverable in rates. We could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances in our water supplies or other environmental damage. For example, private plaintiffs have the right to bring personal injury or other toxic tort claims arising from the presence of hazardous substances in our drinking water supplies. Our insurance policies may not be sufficient to cover the costs of these claims.We have taken steps to increase security measures at our facilities and heighten employee awareness of threats to our water supply, to protect against third-party attacks, including physical attacks, terrorist attacks, and cyber-attacks. We have also tightened our security measures regarding the delivery and handling of certain chemicals used in our business. We have and will continue to bear increased costs for security precautions to protect our facilities, operations, and supplies. These costs may be significant. Despite these tightened security measures, we may not be able to prevent or deter any third-party attacks or be in a position to control the outcome of third-party attacks should they occur.We depend upon our skilled and trained workforce to ensure water delivery. We can give no assurance that we will be able to maintain sufficient human resources to ensure uninterrupted service in all of the districts that we serve.If any of these catastrophic events were to occur, we can give no assurance that our emergency preparedness plans would be adequate and that we would respond effectively, which could result in public or employee harm or adversely affect our revenues, operating results and financial condition.Failure of critical elements of our infrastructure could result in interruption of service, damage to others, or injuries, and could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.We own physical infrastructure, which was installed over a long period of time, both underground and above-ground. This infrastructure is subject to potential failure due to age, operating conditions, or other unknown factors. Failure of any of our facilities or infrastructure could cause flooding, loss of service to our customers, contamination from chemicals we use in operations, or other damages.We operate a dam. If the dam were to fail for any reason, we would lose a water supply and flooding likely would occur. Whether or not we were responsible for the dam's failure, we could be sued. We can give no assurance that we would be able to defend such a suit successfully.We operate several water and wastewater treatment plants. If a major failure of these facilities were to occur, we would have an interruption in service, potential flooding, and could release potentially harmful material into the environment.We operate over 7,000 miles of underground pipeline. Some failures of underground pipelines could release chemicals into the environment, which have a negative impact on sensitive habitats.We rely on our information technology (""IT"") and a number of complex business systems to assist with the management of our business and customer and supplier relationships, and a disruption of these systems could adversely affect our business.Our IT systems are an integral part of our business, and a serious disruption of our IT systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently, which, in turn, could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and adversely affect our results of operations. We depend on our IT systems to bill customers, process orders, provide customer service, manage construction projects, manage our financial records, track assets, remotely monitor certain of our plants and facilities and manage human resources, inventory and accounts receivable collections. Our IT systems also enable us to purchase products from our suppliers and bill customers on a timely basis, maintain cost-effective operations, and provide service to our customers. Some of our mission and business critical IT systems are older, such as our Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system. The steps we have taken to protect our IT systems may be insufficient to protect them from damage or interruption from:•power loss, computer systems failures, including hardware equipment and software applications, and internet, telecommunications or data network failures;•operator negligence or improper operation by, or supervision of, employees;25Table of Contents•physical and electronic loss of customer data due to security breaches, cyber-attacks, misappropriation and similar events;•computer viruses;•intentional security breaches, hacking, denial of services actions, misappropriation of data, and similar events, including intentional cyber security breaches aimed at disrupting and interfering with water treatment processes; and•earthquakes, floods, fires, mudslides and other natural disasters or physical attacks.These events may result in physical and/or electronic loss of customer or financial data, security breaches, misappropriation and other adverse consequences, including liability or regulatory penalties under data privacy laws and regulations. In addition, the lack of redundancy for certain of our IT systems, including billing systems, could exacerbate the impact of any of these events on us.In addition, we may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our business, and we might lack sufficient resources to make the necessary upgrades or replacements of our outdated existing technology to allow us to continue to operate at our current level of efficiency, all of which could adversely impact our business and competitive position.The adequacy of our water supplies depends upon a variety of factors beyond our control. Interruption in the water supply may adversely affect our reputation and earnings.We depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and future needs of our customers. Whether we have an adequate supply varies depending upon a variety of factors, many of which are partially or completely beyond our control, including:•the amount of rainfall;•the amount of water stored in reservoirs;•underground water supply from which well water is pumped;•availability from water wholesalers;•changes in the amount of water used by our customers;•water quality and availability of appropriate treatment technology;•legal limitations on water use such as rationing restrictions during a drought;•changes in prevailing weather patterns and climate; and•population growth.We purchase our water supply from various governmental agencies and others. Water supply availability may be affected by weather conditions, funding and other political and environmental considerations. In addition, our ability to use surface water is subject to regulations regarding water quality and volume limitations. If new regulations are imposed or existing regulations are changed or given new interpretations, the availability of surface water may be materially reduced. A reduction in surface water could result in the need to procure more costly water from other sources, thereby increasing our water production costs and adversely affecting our operating results if not recovered in rates on a timely basis.We have entered into long-term water supply agreements, which commit us to making certain minimum payments whether or not we purchase any water. Therefore, if demand were insufficient to use our required purchases we would have to pay for water we did not receive.From time to time, we enter into water supply agreements with third parties and our business is dependent upon such agreements in order to meet regional demand. For example, we have entered into a water supply contract with the SFPUC that expires on June 30, 2034. We can give no assurance that the SFPUC, or any of the other parties from whom we purchase water, will renew our contracts upon expiration, or that we will not be subject to significant price increases under any such renewed contracts.The parties from whom we purchase water maintain significant infrastructure and systems to deliver water to us. Maintenance of these facilities is beyond our control. If these facilities are not adequately maintained or if these parties otherwise default on their obligations to supply water to us, we may not have adequate water supplies to meet our customers' needs.26Table of ContentsIf we are unable to access adequate water supplies, we may be unable to satisfy all customer demand, which could result in rationing. Rationing may have an adverse effect on cash flow from operations. We can make no guarantee that we will always have access to an adequate supply of water that will meet all required quality standards. Water shortages may affect us in a variety of ways. For example, shortages could:•adversely affect our supply mix by causing us to rely on more expensive purchased water;•adversely affect operating costs;•increase the risk of contamination to our systems due to our inability to maintain sufficient pressure; and•increase capital expenditures for building pipelines to connect to alternative sources of supply, new wells to replace those that are no longer in service or are otherwise inadequate to meet the needs of our customers and reservoirs and other facilities to conserve or reclaim water.We may or may not be able to recover increased operating and construction costs on a timely basis, or at all, for our regulated systems through the ratemaking process. We can give no assurance, as to whether we may be able to recover certain of these costs from third parties that may be responsible, or potentially responsible, for any groundwater contamination.Our water supplies and other aspects of our operations may be affected by climate change.There is strong scientific consensus that human activity including carbon and methane emissions is impacting many planetary systems such as the heat-trapping capacity of the atmosphere; ocean temperature, circulation, acidity, and volume; weather patterns including the severity and frequency of severe weather events; ambient temperatures; and planetary ice cover. Because scientific investigations have been focused globally, there is tremendous uncertainty over the timing, extent, and types of impacts global climate change may have on our service areas and in our water supplies. Moreover, studies of tree ring data show long periods of drought conditions have occurred prior to significant human impacts in California and prior to our operation. Finally, in the last fifty years, California has experienced at least three severe multi-year droughts. We can give no assurance that any of our plans for water reliability and water shortages, including incorporating projected and potential climate change risks into our water supply planning activities, will be adequate or capable of effectively addressing any droughts or longer periods of drought conditions or other conditions affecting water quality and availability. Immediate physical risks could affect our operations and intensify over time as climate change worsens. More frequent flooding, wildfires, sea level rise, rising groundwater, and uneven ground level sinking could damage our assets, including pressurized mains and other pipelines, wells, treatment facilities, and other infrastructure. Wildfires and changes in rainfall may also affect water quality, and both higher temperatures and wildfires can pose risks to employee safety. Farther into the mid-century and late-century horizon, temperature increases may cause declines in snowpack storage, and droughts could decrease surface water supply availability and groundwater recharge while causing increased outdoor demands.  Additional climate-related risks may influence our approach as we support the transition to a low-carbon economy. Transition risks include changes in the market and consumer demands, such as differences in generational behaviors, shifts in population locations due to the pandemic and different weather patterns, and variations in water needs and customer groups. Regulatory risks, such as emission trading systems and carbon taxes, may also financially affect our business. Additionally, federal and state regulations present requirements for managing water supplies and limiting impacts on local wildlife, while regional plans and legislation may directly affect how we address water issues.We also periodically review the climate change plans of our wholesalers to determine whether alternative supplies may be necessary in the future. However, we can give no assurance that replacement water supplies will be available at a reasonable cost or a cost acceptable to our customers and Commissions.Natural disasters, climate change, economic conditions and other factors may change the population in our service areas.In the event that some outside factor such as a wildfire, flood, changed climate pattern, actual or threatened public health emergency, or change in the local economy reduces or eliminates our customer base in a service area, or negatively affects the ability of a customer to pay, we could face unrecoverable costs. In those circumstances, the remaining customers might not be able to pay for the operating costs or capital costs of the water system. We may not be able to recover capital costs of property that is no longer used and useful in utility service. We may also encounter an increase in bad debt expense in times of economic difficulty. For example, we experienced an increase in bad debt expense in 2022, which we believe is due to economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we would likely seek permission to recover these costs through rate increases on remaining customers or in statewide rates, we can give no assurance that the Commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these costs.27Table of ContentsWastewater operations entail significant risks.Wastewater collection and treatment involve many risks associated with damage to the environment, and we anticipate that wastewater collection and treatment will become an increasing significant part of our business. If collection or treatment systems fail or do not operate properly, untreated or partially treated wastewater could discharge onto property or into nearby streams and rivers, causing damage or injury to property, aquatic life, or human life. Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by liabilities resulting from such damage.Demand for our water is subject to various factors and is affected by seasonal fluctuations.Demand for our water during the warmer, dry months is generally greater than during cooler or rainy months due primarily to additional requirements for water in connection with irrigation systems, swimming pools, cooling systems and other outside water use. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically warmer months, demand will vary with temperature and rainfall levels. If temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal, or if there is more rainfall than normal, the demand for our water may decrease. Under the MWRAM mechanism, lower water usage in our California operations affects our cash flows in the year of usage, but results in higher cash flows in the following years.In addition, governmental restrictions on water usage during drought conditions may result in a decreased demand for our water, even if our water reserves are sufficient to serve our customers during these drought conditions. The Commissions may not allow surcharges to collect lost revenues caused by customers' conservation during a drought. Regardless of whether we may surcharge our customers during a conservation period, they may use less water even after a drought has passed because of conservation patterns developed during the drought. Furthermore, our customers may wish to use recycled water as a substitute for potable water. If rights are granted to others to serve our customers recycled water, there will likely be a decrease in demand for our water.Finally, changes in prevailing weather patterns due to climate change may affect customer demand. If increased ambient temperatures affect our service areas, water used for irrigation and cooling may increase. If rainfall patterns change, our customers may change their patterns of water use including the amount of outdoor irrigation and the type of landscape they install. Government agencies may also mandate changes to customer irrigation or landscape patterns in response to changes in weather and climate.Changes in water supply costs affect our operations.The cost to obtain water for delivery to our customers varies depending on the sources of supply, wholesale suppliers' prices, the quality of water required to be treated and the quantity of water produced to fulfill customer water demand. Our source of supply varies among our operating districts. Certain districts obtain all of their supply from wells; some districts purchase all of the supply from wholesale suppliers; and other districts obtain the supply from a combination of wells and wholesale suppliers. A small portion of supply comes from surface sources and is processed through Company-owned water treatment plants. On average, slightly more than half of the water we deliver to our customers is pumped from wells or received from a surface supply with the remainder purchased from wholesale suppliers. Water purchased from suppliers usually costs us more than surface supplied or well pumped water. The cost of purchased water for delivery to customers represented 31.2% and 33.9% of our total operating costs in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Water purchased from suppliers will require renewal of our contracts upon expiration and may result in significant price increases under any such renewed contracts.Wholesale water suppliers may increase their prices for water delivered to us based on factors that affect their operating costs. Purchased water rate increases are beyond our control. In California, our ability to recover increases in the cost of purchased water is expected to change with the adoption of the ICBA, which is effective as of January 1, 2023. With this change, actual per-unit purchased water costs are expected to be compared to authorized per-unit purchased water costs, with variances added to or netted against the variances in purchased power and pump taxes being recorded as a cost recovery. The balance in the ICBA is expected to be collected in the future by billing the ICBA accounts receivable balances over future periods, which may have a short-term negative impact on cash flow.Dependency upon adequate supply of electricity, certain chemicals, and third-party suppliers of parts and skilled labor could adversely affect our results of operations.Purchased electrical power is required to operate the wells and pumps needed to supply water to our customers. Although there are back-up power generators to operate a number of wells and pumps in emergencies, an extended interruption in power could affect the ability to supply water. In the past, California has been subject to rolling power blackouts due to insufficient power supplies. There is no assurance we will not be subject to power blackouts in the future. Additionally, we require sufficient amounts of certain chemicals in order to treat the water we supply. There are multiple sources for these chemicals but an extended interruption of supply could adversely affect our ability to adequately treat our water.28Table of ContentsPurchased power is a significant operating expense. During 2022 and 2021, purchased power expense represented 6.2% and 5.6%, respectively, of our total operating costs. These costs are beyond our control and can change unpredictably and substantially as occurred in California during 2001 when rates paid for electricity increased 48%. As with purchased water, purchased power costs are expected to be included in the ICBA. Cash flows between rate filings may be adversely affected until the Commission authorizes a rate change, but earnings will be minimally impacted. Cost of chemicals used in the delivery of water is not an element of the ICBA, and therefore, variances in quantity or cost could affect the results of operations.We rely on outside contractors to supply us with materials and parts critical to the operation of our systems. Should parts and material become unavailable, or should the cost of necessary supplies rise substantially, it could adversely affect our ability to operate or have financial affects that are not recoverable through a regulatory process.We also rely on outside contractors to complete large construction projects and provide emergency maintenance services. In the event these contractors are unavailable or cannot meet the demands imposed on them, we may face significantly lengthy interruptions of service or delays in constructing capital projects. We may face additional costs to acquire more resources to complete these activities. Our business requires significant capital expenditures to replace or improve aging infrastructure that are dependent on our ability to secure appropriate funding. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital or if the rates at which we borrow increase, there would be a negative impact on our results of operations.The water utility business is capital-intensive. We invest significant funds to replace or improve aging infrastructure such as property, plant, and equipment. In addition, water shortages may adversely affect us by causing us to rely on more purchased water. This could cause increases in capital expenditures needed to build pipelines to secure alternative water sources. In addition, we require capital to grow our business through acquisitions. We fund our short-term capital requirements from cash received from operations and funds received from developers. We seek to meet our long-term capital needs by raising equity through common or preferred stock issues or issuing debt obligations. We cannot give any assurance that these sources will continue to be adequate or that the cost of funds will remain at levels permitting us to earn a reasonable rate of return. In the event we are unable to obtain sufficient capital, our expansion efforts could be curtailed, which may affect our growth and may affect our future results of operations.Our ability to access the capital markets is affected by the ratings of certain of our debt securities. Standard & Poor's Rating Agency issues a rating on California Water Service Company's ability to repay certain debt obligations. The credit rating agency could downgrade our credit rating based on reviews of our financial performance and projections or upon the occurrence of other events that could affect our business outlook. Lower ratings by the agency could restrict our ability to access equity and debt capital. We can give no assurance that the rating agency will maintain ratings that allow us to borrow under advantageous conditions and at reasonable interest rates. A future downgrade by the agency could also increase our cost of capital by causing potential investors to require a higher interest rate due to a perceived risk related to our ability to repay outstanding debt obligations.While the majority of our debt is long term at fixed rates, we do have interest rate exposure in our short-term borrowings, which have variable interest rates. We are also subject to interest rate risks on new financings. However, if interest rates were to increase on a long-term basis, our management believes that customer rates would increase accordingly, subject to approval by the appropriate commission. We can give no assurance that the Commission would approve such an increase in customer rates.We are obligated to comply with specified debt covenants under certain of our loan and debt agreements. Failure to maintain compliance with these covenants could limit future borrowing, and we could face increased borrowing costs, litigation, acceleration of maturity schedules, and cross default issues. Such actions by our creditors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Our inability to access the capital or financial markets could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to meet long-term commitments. Changes in economic conditions in our markets could affect our customers' ability to pay for water services. Any of these could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.We rely on our current credit facilities to fund short-term liquidity needs if internal funds are not available from operations. Specifically, given the seasonal fluctuations in demand for our water we commonly draw on our credit facilities to meet our cash requirements at times in the year when demand is relatively low. We also may occasionally use letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facilities. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to draw on our credit facilities. Our access to funds under our credit facilities is dependent on the ability of our banks to meet their funding commitments.29Table of ContentsMany of our customers and suppliers also have exposure to risks that could affect their ability to meet payment and supply commitments. We operate in geographic areas that may be particularly susceptible to declines in the price of real property, which could result in significant declines in demand for our products and services. In the event that any of our significant customers or suppliers, or a significant number of smaller customers and suppliers, are adversely affected by these risks, we may face disruptions in supply, significant reductions in demand for our products and services, inability of customers to pay invoices when due, and other adverse effects that could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.Our operations and certain contracts for water distribution and treatment depend on the financial capability of state and local governments, and other municipal entities such as water districts. Major disruptions in the financial strength or operations of such entities, such as liquidity limitations, bankruptcy or insolvency, could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business and/or enforce our rights under contracts to which such entities are a party.We are a holding company that depends on cash flow from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock.As a holding company, we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries and our only significant assets are investments in those subsidiaries. 91.6% of our revenues are derived from the operations of California Water Service Company. As a result, we are dependent on cash flow from our subsidiaries, and California Water Service Company in particular, to meet our obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock.Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and generally have no obligation to pay any amounts due on California Water Service Group's debt or to provide California Water Service Group with funds for dividends. Although there are no contractual or regulatory restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us, the reasonableness of our capital structure is one of the factors considered by state and local regulatory agencies in their ratemaking determinations. Therefore, transfer of funds from our subsidiaries to us for the payment of our obligations or dividends may have an adverse effect on ratemaking determinations. Furthermore, our right to receive cash or other assets upon the liquidation or reorganization of a subsidiary is generally subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary. If we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries in a timely manner, we may be unable to meet our obligations or pay dividends.We can make dividend payments only from our surplus (the excess, if any, of our net assets over total paid-in capital) or if there is no surplus, the net profits for the current fiscal year or the fiscal year before which the dividend is declared. In addition, we can pay cash dividends only if after paying those dividends we would be able to pay our liabilities as they become due. Owners of our capital stock cannot force us to pay dividends and dividends will only be paid if and when declared by our board of directors. Our board of directors can elect at any time, and for an indefinite duration, not to declare dividends on our capital stock.An important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems. Risks associated with potential acquisitions, divestitures or restructurings may adversely affect us.We may seek to acquire or invest in other companies, technologies, services, or products that complement our business. The execution of our growth strategy may expose us to different risks than those associated with our utility operations. We can give no assurance that we will succeed in finding attractive acquisition candidates or investments, or that we would be able to reach mutually agreeable terms with such parties. In addition, as consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water and wastewater industries, the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase to unacceptable levels and limit our ability to grow through acquisitions. If we are unable to find acquisition candidates or investments, our ability to grow may be limited.Acquisition and investment transactions may result in the issuance of our equity securities that could be dilutive if the acquisition or business opportunity does not develop in accordance with our business plan. They may also result in significant write-offs and an increase in our debt. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Any of these transactions could involve numerous additional risks, including one or more of the following:•problems integrating the acquired operations, personnel, technologies, physical and cyber security processes, or products with our existing businesses and products;•liabilities inherited from the acquired companies' prior business operations;•diversion of management time and attention from our core business to the acquired business;•failure to retain key technical, management, and other personnel of the acquired business;•difficulty in retaining relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired business; and30Table of Contents•difficulty in obtaining required regulatory approvals.In addition, the businesses and other assets we acquire may not achieve the sales and profitability expected. The occurrence of one or more of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these or any other significant risks encountered.We may not be able to increase or sustain our recent growth rate, and we may not be able to manage our future growth effectively.We may be unable to continue to expand our business or manage future growth. To successfully manage our growth and handle the responsibilities of being a public company, we must effectively:•hire, train, integrate and manage additional qualified engineers for engineering design and construction activities, new business personnel, and financial and information technology personnel;•retain key management, augment our management team, and retain qualified and certified water and wastewater system operators;•implement and improve additional and existing administrative, financial and operations systems, procedures and controls;•expand our technological capabilities; and•manage multiple relationships with our customers, regulators, suppliers and other third parties.If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities, satisfy customer requirements, execute our business plan, or respond to competitive pressures.We have a number of large-volume commercial and industrial customers and a significant decrease in consumption by one or more of these customers could have an adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows.Our billed revenues and cash flows from operations will decrease if a significant business or industrial customer terminates or materially reduces its use of our water. Approximately $180.2 million, or 23.3%, of our 2022 water utility revenues was derived from business and industrial customers. In Hawaii, we serve a number of large resorts, which if their water usage was reduced or ceased could have a material impact to our Hawaii operation. The delay between such date and the effective date of the rate relief may be significant and could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.Our operating cost and costs of providing services may rise faster than our revenues.Our ability to increase rates over time is dependent upon approval of such rate increases by the Commissions, or in the case of the City of Hawthorne and the City of Commerce, the City Council, which may be inclined, for political or other reasons, to limit rate increases. However, our costs, which are subject to market conditions and other factors, may increase significantly. The second largest component of our operating costs after water production is made up of salaries and wages. These costs are affected by the local supply and demand for qualified labor. Other large components of our costs are general insurance, workers compensation insurance, employee benefits and health insurance costs. These costs may increase disproportionately to rate increases authorized by the Commissions and may have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.Demand for our stock may fluctuate due to circumstances beyond our control.We believe that stockholders invest in public utility stocks, in part, because they seek reliable dividend payments. If there is an over-supply of stock of public utilities in the market relative to demand by such investors, the trading price of our securities could decrease. Additionally, if interest rates rise above the dividend yield offered by our equity securities, demand for our stock, and consequently its market price, may decrease. A decline in demand for our stock may have a negative impact on our ability to finance capital projects.31Table of ContentsAdverse investment returns and other factors may increase our pension liability and pension funding requirements.A substantial number of our employees are covered by a defined benefit pension plan. At present, the pension plan is underfunded because our projected pension benefit obligation exceeds the aggregate fair value of plan assets. Under applicable law, we are required to make cash contributions to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding levels imposed by regulatory requirements. The amount of such required cash contribution is based on an actuarial valuation of the plan. The funded status of the plan can be affected by investment returns on plan assets, discount rates, mortality rates of plan participants, pension reform legislation and a number of other factors. There can be no assurance that the value of our pension plan assets will be sufficient to cover future liabilities. Although we contributed to our pension plan in recent years, it is possible that we could incur a pension liability adjustment, or could be required to make additional cash contributions to our pension plan, which would reduce the cash available for business and other needs.Labor relations matters could adversely affect our operating results.At December 31, 2022, 744 of our 1,225 total employees were union employees. Most of our unionized employees are represented by the Utility Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO, except certain engineering and laboratory employees who are represented by the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, AFL-CIO.We believe our labor relations are good, but in light of rising costs for health care and pensions, our current contract negotiations and those in the future may be difficult. Furthermore, changes in applicable law or regulations could have an adverse effect on management's negotiating position with respect to our currently unionized employees and/or employees that decide to unionize in the future. We are subject to a risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters as we negotiate with the unions to address these issues, which could affect our results of operations and financial condition. We can give no assurance that issues with our labor forces will be resolved favorably to us in the future or that we will not experience work stoppages.Our operations are geographically concentrated in California and this lack of diversification may negatively affect our operations.Although we own facilities in a number of states, over 91.6% of our operations are located in California. As a result, we are largely subject to weather, political, water supply, labor, energy cost, regulatory, and economic risks affecting California.We are also affected by the real property market in California. In order to grow our business, we may need to acquire additional real estate or rights to use real property owned by third parties, the cost of which tends to be higher and more volatile in California than in other states. The value of our assets in California may decline if there is a decline in the California real estate market that results in a significant decrease in real property values.Municipalities, water districts and other public agencies may condemn our property by eminent domain action.State statutes allow municipalities, water districts and other public agencies to own and operate water systems. These agencies are empowered to condemn water systems or real property owned by privately owned public utilities in certain circumstances and in compliance with California and federal law. Additionally, whenever a public agency constructs facilities to extend its utility system into the service area of a privately owned public utility, such an act may constitute the taking of property and require reimbursement to the public utility for its loss. If a public agency were to file an eminent domain lawsuit against us, we would incur substantial attorney’s fees, consultant and expert fees, and other costs in considering a challenge to the right to take our utility property and/or its valuation for just compensation, as well as such fees and costs in any subsequent litigation if necessary. If the public agency prevailed and acquired our utility property, we would be entitled to just compensation for our loss, but we would no longer have access to the condemned property or water system. Neither would we be entitled to any portion of revenue generated from the use of such asset going forward.The Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic May Adversely Affect Our OperationsAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a significant impact on our business in 2022, we are unable to accurately predict the full impact that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration and severity of the outbreak, potential resurgence and /or mutations of the virus, and the development, distribution and public acceptance of treatments and vaccines. As an “essential business” during times of emergencies pursuant to the U.S. Critical Infrastructures Protection Act of 2001, we are working to continue to provide water and wastewater services to our two million customers. If we close any of our facilities due to a COVID-19 outbreak or if a critical number of our employees become too ill to work, our business operations could be materially adversely affected in a rapid manner.32Table of ContentsGeneral Risk Factors
We depend significantly on the services of the members of our management team, and the departure of any of those persons could cause our operating results to suffer.Our success depends significantly on the continued individual and collective contributions of our management team. The loss of the services of any member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business as our management team has knowledge of our industry and customers and would be difficult to replace.We retain certain risks not covered by our insurance policies.We evaluate our risks and insurance coverage annually or more frequently if circumstances dictate. Our evaluation considers the costs, risks, and benefits of retaining versus insuring various risks as well as the availability of certain types of insurance coverage. Accordingly, we have determined or may determine to self-insure or to not obtain insurance in certain cases, or insurance may not be available at commercially acceptable terms or at all. Furthermore, we are also affected by increases in prices for insurance coverage; in particular, we have been, and will continue to be, affected by rising health insurance costs. Retained risks are associated with deductible limits, partial self-insurance programs, and insurance policy coverage ceilings. If we suffer an uninsured loss, we may be unable to pass all or any portion of the loss on to customers, because our rates are regulated by regulatory commissions. Consequently, uninsured losses may negatively affect our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will not face uninsured losses pertaining to the risks we have retained.Our enterprise risk management processes may not be effective in identifying and mitigating the risks to which we are subject, or in reducing the potential for losses in connection with such risks.Our enterprise risk management processes are designed to minimize or mitigate the risks to which we are subject, as well as any losses stemming from such risks. Although we seek to identify, measure, monitor, report, and control our exposure to such risks, and employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques in the process, those techniques are inherently limited in their ability to anticipate the existence or development of risks that are currently unknown and unanticipated. The ineffectiveness of our enterprise risk management processes in mitigating the impact of known risks or the emergence of previously unknown or unanticipated risks may result in our incurring losses in the future that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.The accuracy of our judgments and estimates about financial and accounting matters will affect our operating results and financial condition.We make certain estimates and judgments in preparing our financial statements regarding, among others:•the useful life of intangible rights;•the number of years to depreciate certain assets;•amounts to set aside for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory obsolescence and uninsured losses;•our legal exposure and the appropriate accrual for claims, including medical claims and workers' compensation claims;•future costs and assumptions for pensions and other postretirement benefits;•regulatory recovery of regulatory assets;•possible tax uncertainties; and•projected collections of WRAM and MCBA receivables or receivables under subsequent recovery mechanisms, such as MWRAM and ICBA.The quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments may have an impact on our operating results and financial condition.In addition, we must estimate unbilled revenues and costs as of the end of each accounting period. If our estimates are not accurate, we would be required to make an adjustment in a future period. Accounting rules permit us to use expense balancing accounts and memorandum accounts that include cost changes to us that are different from amounts incorporated into the rates approved by the Commissions. These accounts result in expenses and revenues being recognized in periods other than in which they occurred.33Table of ContentsWe identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, and, if not remediated effectively, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable laws and regulations could be impaired, which could result in loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and materially adversely affect our results of operations and stock price.The accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls. We are required to provide a report from management to our stockholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls. As disclosed in Part II, Item 9A, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2022 due to a material weakness in our internal control over the completeness of our accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities, specifically controls over the identification of regulatory filings by the Company during the period that are then reviewed to determine their potential accounting impact. This material weakness has not yet been remediated and remained at the time of the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022. We can provide no assurance that our remediation plan to address this material weakness, including, but not limited to, revising the design of existing controls and implementing new controls, will be successful. Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, and fraud. Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud. If we are unable to remediate the material weakness in a timely manner, or are otherwise unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, we could suffer harm to our reputation, incur incremental compliance costs, fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis, be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations, or be required to restate our financial statements, which could result in loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses, and our results of operations and our stock price could be materially adversely affected"
10,CWT,CALIFORNIA WATER SERVICE GP,2022-02-24,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
.In evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the following discussion of material risks, events and uncertainties that make an investment in us speculative or risky in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A manifestation of any of the following risks and uncertainties could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, materially and adversely affect our business, growth, reputation, prospects, operating and financial results, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity, and stock price. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors; our operations could also be affected by factors, events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. Therefore, you should not consider the following risks to be a complete statement of all the potential risks or uncertainties that we face.Risks Related to Our Regulatory EnvironmentOur business is heavily regulated by state and federal regulatory agencies and our financial viability depends upon our ability to recover costs from our customers through rates that must be approved by state public utility commissions.California Water Service Company, New Mexico Water Service Company, Washington Water Service Company, and Hawaii Water Service Company, Inc. are regulated public utilities, which provide water and water-related service to our customers. Additionally, Hawaii Water Service Company, Inc. and TWSC, Inc. own in whole or in part other companies, which are regulated public utilities. The rates that we charge our water customers are subject to the jurisdiction of the regulatory commissions in the states in which we operate. These Commissions may set water and water-related rates for each operating district independently because the systems are not interconnected. The Commissions authorize us to charge rates that they consider sufficient to recover normal operating expenses, to provide funds for adding new or replacing water infrastructure, and to allow us to earn what the Commissions consider to be a fair and reasonable return on invested capital.19Table of ContentsOur revenues and consequently our ability to meet our financial objectives are dependent upon the rates we are authorized to charge our customers by the Commissions and our ability to recover our costs in these rates. Our management uses forecasts, models and estimates in order to set rates that will provide a fair and reasonable return on our invested capital. While our rates must be approved by the Commissions, no assurance can be given that our forecasts, models and estimates will be correct or that the Commissions will agree with our forecasts, models and estimates. If our rates are set too low, our revenues may be insufficient to cover our operating expenses, capital expenditure requirements and desired dividend levels.We periodically file rate increase applications with the Commissions. The ensuing administrative and hearing process may be lengthy and costly. The decisions of the Commissions are beyond our control and we can provide no assurances that our rate increase requests will be granted by the Commissions. Even if approved, there is no guarantee that approval will be given in a timely manner or at a sufficient level to cover our expenses and provide a reasonable return on our investment. If the rate increase decisions are delayed, our earnings may be adversely affected. For example, the CPUC did not issue its decision on our 2018 GRC until December 2020, approximately one year later than expected, which caused some financial and operating uncertainty for the Company until that time.Our evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets is subject to adjustment by regulatory agencies and any such adjustment could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Regulatory decisions may also affect prospective revenues and earnings, affect the timing of the recognition of revenues and expenses and may overturn past decisions used in determining our revenues and expenses. Our management continually evaluates the anticipated recovery of regulatory assets and revenues subject to refund and provides for allowances and/or reserves as deemed necessary. Current accounting procedures allow us to defer certain costs if we believe it is probable that we will be allowed to recover those costs through future rate increases. If the Commissions determined that a portion of our assets were not recoverable in customer rates, we may suffer an asset impairment, which would require a write down in such asset's valuation that would be recorded through operations.If our assessment as to the probability of recovery through the ratemaking process were incorrect, the associated regulatory asset would be adjusted to reflect the change in our assessment or any regulatory disallowances. A change in our evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets or a regulatory disallowance of all or a portion of our cost could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.Regulatory agencies may disagree with our valuation and characterization of certain of our assets.If we determine that assets are no longer used or useful for utility operations, we may remove them from our rate base and subsequently sell those assets with any gain on sales accruing to the stockholders, subject to certain conditions. If the Commissions disagree with our characterization, there is a risk that the Commissions could determine that realized appreciation in property value should be awarded to customers rather than our stockholders.Changes in laws, rules, and policies of our regulators or operating jurisdictions can significantly affect our business.Regulatory agencies may change their rules and policies for various reasons, including changes in the local political environment. Regulators are elected by popular vote or are appointed by elected officials, and the results of elections may change the long-established rules and policies of an agency dramatically. For example, in 2020 regulation regarding full decoupling WRAMs changed in California. Since 2008, the CPUC allowed full decoupling WRAMs. However, in 2020, the CPUC precluded companies from proposing full decoupling WRAMs in their next GRC filings. The decision by the CPUC to change its policy will affect our business beginning in 2023.We rely on policies and regulations promulgated by the various state commissions in order to recover capital expenditures, maintain favorable treatment on gains from the sale of real property, offset certain production and operating costs, recover the cost of debt, maintain an optimal equity structure without over-leveraging, and have financial and operational flexibility to engage in non-regulated operations. If any of the Commissions with jurisdiction over us implements policies and regulations that do not allow us to accomplish some or all of the items listed above, our future operating results may be adversely affected.In addition, legislatures may repeal, relax or tighten existing laws, or enact new laws that affect the regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over our business or affect our business directly. If changes in existing laws or the implementation of new laws limit our ability to accomplish some of our business objectives, our future operating results may be adversely affected.20Table of ContentsFinally, local jurisdictions may impose new ordinances, laws, fees, and regulations that could increase costs or limit our operations in ways, which affect future operating results. Cities may impose or amend franchise requirements, impose conditions on underground construction or land use, impose various taxes and fees, or restrict our hours for construction, among other things. In the last decade, more cities have imposed excavation moratoria or paving rules, which has required more costly construction than anticipated.We expect environmental health and safety regulation to increase, resulting in higher operating costs in the future and the potential that the company fails to meet these regulatory standards.Our water and wastewater services are governed by various federal and state environmental protection, health and safety laws, and regulations. Although we have a rigorous water quality assurance program in place, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to comply with all standards. If we violate any federal or state regulations or laws governing health and safety, we could be subject to substantial fines or otherwise sanctioned, subject to potential civil liability for damages, and our customers' trust in our operations ability could be eroded.Environmental health and safety laws are complex and change frequently. They tend to become more stringent over time. As new or stricter standards are introduced, they could increase our operating costs. Although we would likely seek permission to recover these costs through rate increases, we can give no assurance that the Commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs.We are required to test our water quality for certain chemicals and potential contaminants on a regular basis. If the test results indicate that our water exceeds allowable limits, we may be required either to commence treatment to remove the contaminant or to develop an alternate water source. Either of these results may be costly. Although we would likely seek permission to recover these through rate increases, there can be no assurance that the Commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs.Past events in the utility sector, including those in Flint, Michigan and related to Pacific Gas and Electric Company in California, show that failure to meet one or more water quality, environmental, or safety standards can have severe effects on customer trust, reputation, regulatory treatment, or civil and criminal liability.New and/or more stringent water quality regulations could increase our operating costs.We are subject to water quality standards set by federal, state, and local authorities that have the power to issue new regulations. Compliance with new regulations that are more stringent than current regulations could increase our operating costs. In August of 2009, the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment within the California Environmental Protection Agency changed the water quality standard for TCP in our water supply. The new standard requires us to have 0.0007 parts per billion or less of TCP in our California water supply. We have incurred costs associated with the compliance of the new TCP standard and expect to continue to incur costs in the future. In 2018, we received proceeds from a TCP settlement (see note 15 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements) that has been used to offset some of the compliance costs that we have incurred. Although we would likely seek permission to these additional costs through the GRC process, we can give no assurance that the CPUC would approve the recovery of these additional compliance costs.Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are two water contaminants of emerging concern. Although a water quality standard has yet to be set by federal or state regulators, preliminary testing, and guidance from the California Environmental Protection Agency has affected our operations of some wells in California. We expect that a water quality standard will be set in the future and that we will incur costs to comply with the water quality standard. Cal Water has requested and been approved to use a memorandum account to track the incremental compliance costs in the future and we would likely seek permission to recover additional costs of compliance through rate increases; however, we can give no assurance that the CPUC would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs.Legislation and regulation designed to mitigate or adapt to climate change may affect our operations.Future legislation or regulation regarding climate change may restrict our operations or impose new costs on our business. Our operations depend on power provided by other public utilities and, in emergencies, power generated by our portable and fixed generators. If future legislation or regulation limits emissions from the power generation process, our cost of power may increase. Any increase in the cost of power will be passed along to our California customers through the MCBA or included in our cost of service paid by our customers as requested in our GRC filings in California.21Table of ContentsWe have been and may in the future be party to environmental and product-related lawsuits, which could result in us paying damages not covered by insurance.We have been and may be in the future, party to water contamination lawsuits, which may not be fully covered by insurance.The number of environmental and product-related lawsuits against other water utilities has increased in frequency in recent years. If we are subject to additional environmental or product-related lawsuits, we might incur significant legal costs and it is uncertain whether we would be able to recover the legal costs from customers or other third parties. In addition, if current California law regarding CPUC's preemptive jurisdiction over regulated public utilities for claims about compliance with California Department of Health Services and United States EPA water quality standards changes, our legal exposure may be significantly increased.Risks Related to Our Business OperationsThe Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic May Adversely Affect Our OperationsAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a significant impact on our business in 2021, we are unable to accurately predict the full impact that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration and severity of the outbreak, potential resurgence and /or mutations of the virus, and the development, distribution and public acceptance of treatments and vaccines. As an “essential business” during times of emergencies pursuant to the U.S. Critical Infrastructures Protection Act of 2001, we are working to continue to provide high quality water and wastewater services to our two million customers. During the course of 2021, shelter-in-place and social distancing ordinances of varying durations and scope were in effect in all of the states in which we operate. Such governmental orders resulted in temporary closures of non-essential businesses and self-quarantining on non-essential workers. If we close any of our facilities due to a COVID-19 outbreak or if a critical number of our employees become too ill to work, our business operations could be materially adversely affected in a rapid manner. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant disruption to economic activity and the states in which the Company operates have experienced significant increases in unemployment claims and business closures. The Company has also ceased all shutoffs for nonpayment during the pandemic. If a significant number of customers are unable to pay utility bills for an extended period of time our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be materially adversely affected.We may be at risk for litigation under the principle of inverse condemnation for activities in the normal course of business, which have a damaging effect on private property.The California constitution may allow compensation to property owners for a public utility taking or damaging private property, even when damage occurs through no fault of the utility and regardless of whether the damage could be foreseen by the utility. As a result, this doctrine, which is known as inverse condemnation and is routinely invoked in California, imposes strict liability for damages, including legal fees, because of the design, construction, and maintenance of utility facilities. In addition to claims that our water or wastewater systems damaged property, Cal Water could be sued under inverse condemnation if its facilities or operations damage private property, or if it is unable to timely deliver sufficient quantities of water for firefighting because of system capacity limitations or water supply disruptions, including as a result of action taken by an electric utility pursuant to a PSPS program or other loss of power. Although the imposition of liability is premised on the assumption that utilities have the ability to recover these costs from their customers, there is no assurance that the CPUC would allow Cal Water to recover any such damage awards from customers. For example, in December 2017, the CPUC denied recovery of costs that San Diego Gas & Electric Company incurred because of inverse condemnation, holding that the inverse condemnation principles of strict liability are not relevant to the CPUC’s prudent manager standard.The effects of natural disasters, attacks by third parties, pandemics, or poor water quality or contamination to our water supply may result in disruption in our services and litigation, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.We operate in areas that are prone to earthquakes, fires, mudslides and other natural disasters. A significant seismic event or other natural disaster in California where our operations are concentrated could adversely affect our ability to deliver water and adversely affect our costs of operations. A major disaster could damage or destroy substantial capital assets. The CPUC has historically allowed utilities to establish a catastrophic event memorandum account as another possible mechanism to recover costs. However, we can give no assurance that the CPUC or any other commission would allow any such cost recovery mechanism in the future.22Table of ContentsOur water supplies are subject to contamination, including contamination from the development of naturally-occurring compounds, chemicals in groundwater systems, pollution resulting from fabricated sources, such as TCP, seawater incursion and possible third-party attacks, including physical attacks, terrorist attacks, and cyber-attacks. If our water supply is contaminated, we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water source. In addition, we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities, or development of new treatment methods. If we are unable to substitute water supply from an uncontaminated water source, or if we are unable to adequately treat the contaminated water source in a cost-effective manner, there may be an adverse effect on our revenues, operating results and financial condition. The costs we incur to decontaminate a water source or an underground water system could be significant and may not be recoverable in rates. We could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances in our water supplies or other environmental damage. For example, private plaintiffs have the right to bring personal injury or other toxic tort claims arising from the presence of hazardous substances in our drinking water supplies. Our insurance policies may not be sufficient to cover the costs of these claims.We have taken steps to increase security measures at our facilities and heighten employee awareness of threats to our water supply, to protect against third-party attacks, including physical attacks, terrorist attacks, and cyber-attacks. We have also tightened our security measures regarding the delivery and handling of certain chemicals used in our business. We have and will continue to bear increased costs for security precautions to protect our facilities, operations, and supplies. These costs may be significant. Despite these tightened security measures, we may not be in a position to control the outcome of third-party attacks should they occur.We depend upon our skilled and trained workforce to ensure water delivery. Were a pandemic to occur, we can give no assurance that we would be able to maintain sufficient human resources to ensure uninterrupted service in all of the districts that we serve.If any of these catastrophic events were to occur, we can give no assurance that our emergency preparedness plans would be adequate and that we would respond effectively, which could result in public or employee harm.Failure of critical elements of our infrastructure could result in interruption of service, damage to others, or injuries, and could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.We own physical infrastructure, which was installed over a long period of time, both underground and above-ground. This infrastructure is subject to potential failure due to age, operating conditions, or other unknown factors. Failure of any of our facilities could cause flooding, loss of service to our customers, contamination from chemicals we use in operations, or other damages.We operate a dam. If the dam were to fail for any reason, we would lose a water supply and flooding likely would occur. Whether or not we were responsible for the dam's failure, we could be sued. We can give no assurance that we would be able to defend such a suit successfully.We operate several water and wastewater treatment plants. If a major failure of these facilities were to occur, we would have an interruption in service, potential flooding, and could release potentially harmful material into the environment.We operate over 7,000 miles of underground pipeline. Some failures of underground pipelines could release chemicals into the environment, which have a negative impact on sensitive habitats.We rely on our information technology (""IT"") and a number of complex business systems to assist with the management of our business and customer and supplier relationships, and a disruption of these systems could adversely affect our business.Our IT systems are an integral part of our business, and a serious disruption of our IT systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently, which, in turn, could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and adversely affect our results of operations. We depend on our IT systems to bill customers, process orders, provide customer service, manage construction projects, manage our financial records, track assets, remotely monitor certain of our plants and facilities and manage human resources, inventory and accounts receivable collections. Our IT systems also enable us to purchase products from our suppliers and bill customers on a timely basis, maintain cost-effective operations, and provide service to our customers. Some of our mission and business critical IT systems are older, such as our Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system. The steps we have taken to protect our IT systems may be insufficient to protect them from damage or interruption from:•power loss, computer systems failures, and internet, telecommunications or data network failures;•operator negligence or improper operation by, or supervision of, employees;23Table of Contents•physical and electronic loss of customer data due to security breaches, cyber-attacks, misappropriation and similar events;•computer viruses;•intentional security breaches, hacking, denial of services actions, misappropriation of data, and similar events, including intentional cyber security breaches aimed at disrupting and interfering with water treatment processes; and•earthquakes, floods, fires, mudslides and other natural disasters or physical attacks.These events may result in physical and/or electronic loss of customer or financial data, security breaches, misappropriation and other adverse consequences, including liability or regulatory penalties under data privacy laws and regulations. In addition, the lack of redundancy for certain of our IT systems, including billing systems, could exacerbate the impact of any of these events on us.In addition, we may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our business, and we might lack sufficient resources to make the necessary upgrades or replacements of our outdated existing technology to allow us to continue to operate at our current level of efficiency.The adequacy of our water supplies depends upon a variety of factors beyond our control. Interruption in the water supply may adversely affect our reputation and earnings.We depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and future needs of our customers. Whether we have an adequate supply varies depending upon a variety of factors, many of which are partially or completely beyond our control, including:•the amount of rainfall;•the amount of water stored in reservoirs;•underground water supply from which well water is pumped;•availability from water wholesalers;•changes in the amount of water used by our customers;•water quality and availability of appropriate treatment technology;•legal limitations on water use such as rationing restrictions during a drought;•changes in prevailing weather patterns and climate; and•population growth.We purchase our water supply from various governmental agencies and others. Water supply availability may be affected by weather conditions, funding and other political and environmental considerations. In addition, our ability to use surface water is subject to regulations regarding water quality and volume limitations. If new regulations are imposed or existing regulations are changed or given new interpretations, the availability of surface water may be materially reduced. A reduction in surface water could result in the need to procure more costly water from other sources, thereby increasing our water production costs and adversely affecting our operating results if not recovered in rates on a timely basis.We have entered into long-term water supply agreements, which commit us to making certain minimum payments whether or not we purchase any water. Therefore, if demand were insufficient to use our required purchases we would have to pay for water we did not receive.From time to time, we enter into water supply agreements with third parties and our business is dependent upon such agreements in order to meet regional demand. For example, we have entered into a water supply contract with the SFPUC that expires on June 30, 2034. We can give no assurance that the SFPUC, or any of the other parties from whom we purchase water, will renew our contracts upon expiration, or that we will not be subject to significant price increases under any such renewed contracts.The parties from whom we purchase water maintain significant infrastructure and systems to deliver water to us. Maintenance of these facilities is beyond our control. If these facilities are not adequately maintained or if these parties otherwise default on their obligations to supply water to us, we may not have adequate water supplies to meet our customers' needs.24Table of ContentsIf we are unable to access adequate water supplies, we may be unable to satisfy all customer demand, which could result in rationing. Rationing may have an adverse effect on cash flow from operations. We can make no guarantee that we will always have access to an adequate supply of water that will meet all required quality standards. Water shortages may affect us in a variety of ways. For example, shortages could:•adversely affect our supply mix by causing us to rely on more expensive purchased water;•adversely affect operating costs;•increase the risk of contamination to our systems due to our inability to maintain sufficient pressure; and•increase capital expenditures for building pipelines to connect to alternative sources of supply, new wells to replace those that are no longer in service or are otherwise inadequate to meet the needs of our customers and reservoirs and other facilities to conserve or reclaim water.We may or may not be able to recover increased operating and construction costs on a timely basis, or at all, for our regulated systems through the ratemaking process. Although we can give no assurance, we may be able to recover certain of these costs from third parties that may be responsible, or potentially responsible, for groundwater contamination.Our water supplies and other aspects of our operations may be affected by climate change.There is strong scientific consensus that human activity including carbon and methane emissions is impacting many planetary systems such as the heat-trapping capacity of the atmosphere; ocean temperature, circulation, acidity, and volume; weather patterns including the severity and frequency of severe weather events; ambient temperatures; and planetary ice cover. Because scientific investigations have been focused globally, there is tremendous uncertainty over the timing, extent, and types of impacts global climate change may have on our service areas and in our water supplies. Moreover, studies of tree ring data show long periods of drought conditions have occurred prior to significant human impacts in California and prior to our operation. Finally, in the last fifty years, California has experienced at least three severe multi-year droughts. Thus, we plan for water reliability and water shortages including projected and potential climate change risks in our water supply planning activities. Immediate physical risks could affect our operations and intensify over time as climate change worsens. More frequent flooding, wildfires, sea level rise, rising groundwater, and uneven ground level sinking could damage our assets, including pressurized mains, wells, treatment facilities, and other infrastructure. Wildfires and changes in rainfall may also affect water quality, and both higher temperatures and wildfires can pose risks to employee safety. Farther into the mid-century and late-century horizon, temperature increases may cause declines in snowpack storage, and droughts could decrease surface water supply availability and groundwater recharge while causing increased outdoor demands.  Additional climate-related risks may influence our approach as we support the transition to a low-carbon economy. Transition risks include changes in the market and consumer demands, such as differences in generational behaviors, shifts in population locations due to the pandemic and different weather patterns, and variations in water needs and customer groups. Regulatory risks, such as emission trading systems and carbon taxes, may also financially affect our business. Additionally, federal and state regulations present requirements for managing water supplies and limiting impacts on local wildlife, while regional plans and legislation may directly affect how we address water issues.We also periodically review the climate change plans of our wholesalers to determine whether alternative supplies may be necessary in the future. However, we can give no assurance that replacement water supplies will be available at a reasonable cost or a cost acceptable to our customers and Commissions.Natural disasters, climate change, and other factors may change the population in our service areas.In the event that some outside factor such as a wildfire, flood, changed climate pattern, actual or threatened public health emergency, or change in the local economy reduces or eliminates our customer base in a service area, we could face unrecoverable costs. In those circumstances, the remaining customers might not be able to pay for the operating costs or capital costs of the water system. The company may not be able to recover capital costs of property that is no longer used and useful in utility service. Although we would likely seek permission to recover these costs through rate increases on remaining customers or in statewide rates, we can give no assurance that the Commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these costs.25Table of ContentsWastewater operations entail significant risks.Wastewater collection and treatment involve many risks associated with damage to the environment, and we anticipate that wastewater collection and treatment will become an increasing significant part of our business. If collection or treatment systems fail or do not operate properly, untreated or partially treated wastewater could discharge onto property or into nearby streams and rivers, causing property damage or injury to aquatic life, or even human life. Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by liabilities resulting from such damage.Demand for our water is subject to various factors and is affected by seasonal fluctuations.Demand for our water during the warmer, dry months is generally greater than during cooler or rainy months due primarily to additional requirements for water in connection with irrigation systems, swimming pools, cooling systems and other outside water use. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically warmer months, demand will vary with temperature and rainfall levels. If temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal, or if there is more rainfall than normal, the demand for our water may decrease. Under the WRAM mechanism, lower water usage in our California operations affects our cash flows in the year of usage, but results in higher cash flows in the following years.In addition, governmental restrictions on water usage during drought conditions may result in a decreased demand for our water, even if our water reserves are sufficient to serve our customers during these drought conditions. The Commissions may not allow surcharges to collect lost revenues caused by customers' conservation during a drought. Regardless of whether we may surcharge our customers during a conservation period, they may use less water even after a drought has passed because of conservation patterns developed during the drought. Furthermore, our customers may wish to use recycled water as a substitute for potable water. If rights are granted to others to serve our customers recycled water, there will likely be a decrease in demand for our water.Finally, changes in prevailing weather patterns due to climate change may affect customer demand. If increased ambient temperatures affect our service areas, water used for irrigation and cooling may increase. If rainfall patterns change, our customers may change their patterns of water use including the amount of outdoor irrigation and the type of landscape they install. Government agencies may also mandate changes to customer irrigation or landscape patterns in response to changes in weather and climate.Changes in water supply costs affect our operations.The cost to obtain water for delivery to our customers varies depending on the sources of supply, wholesale suppliers' prices, the quality of water required to be treated and the quantity of water produced to fulfill customer water demand. Our source of supply varies among our operating districts. Certain districts obtain all of their supply from wells; some districts purchase all of the supply from wholesale suppliers; and other districts obtain the supply from a combination of wells and wholesale suppliers. A small portion of supply comes from surface sources and is processed through Company-owned water treatment plants. On average, slightly more than half of the water we deliver to our customers is pumped from wells or received from a surface supply with the remainder purchased from wholesale suppliers. Water purchased from suppliers usually costs us more than surface supplied or well pumped water. The cost of purchased water for delivery to customers represented 33.9% and 35.0% of our total operating costs in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Water purchased from suppliers will require renewal of our contracts upon expiration and may result in significant price increases under any such renewed contracts.Wholesale water suppliers may increase their prices for water delivered to us based on factors that affect their operating costs. Purchased water rate increases are beyond our control. In California, effective July 1, 2008, our ability to recover increases in the cost of purchased water changed with the adoption of the MCBA. With this change, actual purchased water costs are compared to authorized purchased water costs, with variances netted against the variances in purchased power, pump tax, and metered revenue, being recorded to revenue. The balance in the MCBA will be collected in the future by billing the net WRAM and MCBA accounts receivable balances over 12, 18, and 18+ month periods, which may have a short-term negative impact on cash flow.Dependency upon adequate supply of electricity, certain chemicals, and third-party suppliers of parts and skilled labor could adversely affect our results of operations.Purchased electrical power is required to operate the wells and pumps needed to supply water to our customers. Although there are back-up power generators to operate a number of wells and pumps in emergencies, an extended interruption in power could affect the ability to supply water. In the past, California has been subject to rolling power blackouts due to insufficient power supplies. There is no assurance we will not be subject to power blackouts in the future. Additionally, we require sufficient amounts of certain chemicals in order to treat the water we supply. There are multiple sources for these chemicals but an extended interruption of supply could adversely affect our ability to adequately treat our water.26Table of ContentsPurchased power is a significant operating expense. During 2021 and 2020, purchased power expense represented 5.6% and 5.2%, respectively, of our total operating costs. These costs are beyond our control and can change unpredictably and substantially as occurred in California during 2001 when rates paid for electricity increased 48%. As with purchased water, purchased power costs are included in the MCBA. Cash flows between rate filings may be adversely affected until the Commission authorizes a rate change, but earnings will be minimally impacted. Cost of chemicals used in the delivery of water is not an element of the MCBA, and therefore, variances in quantity or cost could affect the results of operations.We rely on outside contractors to supply us with materials and parts critical to the operation of our systems. Should parts and material become unavailable, or should the cost of necessary supplies rise substantially, it could adversely affect our ability to operate or have financial affects that are not recoverable through a regulatory process.We also rely on outside contractors to complete large construction projects and provide emergency maintenance services. In the event these contractors are unavailable or cannot meet the demands imposed on them, we may face significantly lengthy interruptions of service or delays in constructing capital projects. We may face additional costs to acquire more resources to complete these activities. Our business requires significant capital expenditures to replace or improve aging infrastructure that are dependent on our ability to secure appropriate funding. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital or if the rates at which we borrow increase, there would be a negative impact on our results of operations.The water utility business is capital-intensive. We invest significant funds to replace or improve aging infrastructure such as property, plant, and equipment. In addition, water shortages may adversely affect us by causing us to rely on more purchased water. This could cause increases in capital expenditures needed to build pipelines to secure alternative water sources. In addition, we require capital to grow our business through acquisitions. We fund our short-term capital requirements from cash received from operations and funds received from developers. We also borrow funds from banks under short-term bank lending arrangements. We seek to meet our long-term capital needs by raising equity through common or preferred stock issues or issuing debt obligations. We cannot give any assurance that these sources will continue to be adequate or that the cost of funds will remain at levels permitting us to earn a reasonable rate of return. In the event we are unable to obtain sufficient capital, our expansion efforts could be curtailed, which may affect our growth and may affect our future results of operations.Our ability to access the capital markets is affected by the ratings of certain of our debt securities. Standard & Poor's Rating Agency issues a rating on California Water Service Company's ability to repay certain debt obligations. The credit rating agency could downgrade our credit rating based on reviews of our financial performance and projections or upon the occurrence of other events that could affect our business outlook. Lower ratings by the agency could restrict our ability to access equity and debt capital. We can give no assurance that the rating agency will maintain ratings that allow us to borrow under advantageous conditions and at reasonable interest rates. A future downgrade by the agency could also increase our cost of capital by causing potential investors to require a higher interest rate due to a perceived risk related to our ability to repay outstanding debt obligations.While the majority of our debt is long term at fixed rates, we do have interest rate exposure in our short-term borrowings, which have variable interest rates. We are also subject to interest rate risks on new financings. However, if interest rates were to increase on a long-term basis, our management believes that customer rates would increase accordingly, subject to approval by the appropriate commission. We can give no assurance that the Commission would approve such an increase in customer rates.We are obligated to comply with specified debt covenants under certain of our loan and debt agreements. Failure to maintain compliance with these covenants could limit future borrowing, and we could face increased borrowing costs, litigation, acceleration of maturity schedules, and cross default issues. Such actions by our creditors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Our inability to access the capital or financial markets could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to meet long-term commitments. Changes in economic conditions in our markets could affect our customers' ability to pay for water services. Any of these could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.We rely on our current credit facilities to fund short-term liquidity needs if internal funds are not available from operations. Specifically, given the seasonal fluctuations in demand for our water we commonly draw on our credit facilities to meet our cash requirements at times in the year when demand is relatively low. We also may occasionally use letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facilities. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to draw on our credit facilities. Our access to funds under our credit facilities is dependent on the ability of our banks to meet their funding commitments.27Table of ContentsMany of our customers and suppliers also have exposure to risks that could affect their ability to meet payment and supply commitments. We operate in geographic areas that may be particularly susceptible to declines in the price of real property, which could result in significant declines in demand for our products and services. In the event that any of our significant customers or suppliers, or a significant number of smaller customers and suppliers, are adversely affected by these risks, we may face disruptions in supply, significant reductions in demand for our products and services, inability of customers to pay invoices when due, and other adverse effects that could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.Our operations and certain contracts for water distribution and treatment depend on the financial capability of state and local governments, and other municipal entities such as water districts. Major disruptions in the financial strength or operations of such entities, such as liquidity limitations, bankruptcy or insolvency, could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business and/or enforce our rights under contracts to which such entities are a party.We are a holding company that depends on cash flow from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock.As a holding company, we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries and our only significant assets are investments in those subsidiaries. 91.9% of our revenues are derived from the operations of California Water Service Company. As a result, we are dependent on cash flow from our subsidiaries, and California Water Service Company in particular, to meet our obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock.Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and generally have no obligation to pay any amounts due on California Water Service Group's debt or to provide California Water Service Group with funds for dividends. Although there are no contractual or regulatory restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us, the reasonableness of our capital structure is one of the factors considered by state and local regulatory agencies in their ratemaking determinations. Therefore, transfer of funds from our subsidiaries to us for the payment of our obligations or dividends may have an adverse effect on ratemaking determinations. Furthermore, our right to receive cash or other assets upon the liquidation or reorganization of a subsidiary is generally subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary. If we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries in a timely manner, we may be unable to meet our obligations or pay dividends.We can make dividend payments only from our surplus (the excess, if any, of our net assets over total paid-in capital) or if there is no surplus, the net profits for the current fiscal year or the fiscal year before which the dividend is declared. In addition, we can pay cash dividends only if after paying those dividends we would be able to pay our liabilities as they become due. Owners of our capital stock cannot force us to pay dividends and dividends will only be paid if and when declared by our board of directors. Our board of directors can elect at any time, and for an indefinite duration, not to declare dividends on our capital stock.An important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems. Risks associated with potential acquisitions, divestitures or restructurings may adversely affect us.We may seek to acquire or invest in other companies, technologies, services, or products that complement our business. The execution of our growth strategy may expose us to different risks than those associated with our utility operations. We can give no assurance that we will succeed in finding attractive acquisition candidates or investments, or that we would be able to reach mutually agreeable terms with such parties. In addition, as consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water and wastewater industries, the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase to unacceptable levels and limit our ability to grow through acquisitions. If we are unable to find acquisition candidates or investments, our ability to grow may be limited.Acquisition and investment transactions may result in the issuance of our equity securities that could be dilutive if the acquisition or business opportunity does not develop in accordance with our business plan. They may also result in significant write-offs and an increase in our debt. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Any of these transactions could involve numerous additional risks, including one or more of the following:•problems integrating the acquired operations, personnel, technologies, physical and cyber security processes, or products with our existing businesses and products;•liabilities inherited from the acquired companies' prior business operations;•diversion of management time and attention from our core business to the acquired business;•failure to retain key technical, management, sales and other personnel of the acquired business;•difficulty in retaining relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired business; and28Table of Contents•difficulty in obtaining required regulatory approvals.In addition, the businesses and other assets we acquire may not achieve the sales and profitability expected. The occurrence of one or more of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these or any other significant risks encountered.We may not be able to increase or sustain our recent growth rate, and we may not be able to manage our future growth effectively.We may be unable to continue to expand our business or manage future growth. To successfully manage our growth and handle the responsibilities of being a public company, we must effectively:•hire, train, integrate and manage additional qualified engineers for engineering design and construction activities, new business personnel, and financial and information technology personnel;•retain key management, augment our management team, and retain qualified and certified water and wastewater system operators;•implement and improve additional and existing administrative, financial and operations systems, procedures and controls;•expand our technological capabilities; and•manage multiple relationships with our customers, regulators, suppliers and other third parties.If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities, satisfy customer requirements, execute our business plan, or respond to competitive pressures.We have a number of large-volume commercial and industrial customers and a significant decrease in consumption by one or more of these customers could have an adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows.Our billed revenues and cash flows from operations will decrease if a significant business or industrial customer terminates or materially reduces its use of our water. Approximately $171.1 million, or 22.3%, of our 2021 water utility revenues was derived from business and industrial customers. However, if any of our large business or industrial customers in California reduce or cease its consumption of our water, the affect to net operating income would be minimal to our operations due to the WRAM and MCBA, but could impact our cash flows. In Hawaii, we serve a number of large resorts, which if their water usage was reduced or ceased could have a material impact to our Hawaii operation. The delay between such date and the effective date of the rate relief may be significant and could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.Our operating cost and costs of providing services may rise faster than our revenues.Our ability to increase rates over time is dependent upon approval of such rate increases by the Commissions, or in the case of the City of Hawthorne and the City of Commerce, the City Council, which may be inclined, for political or other reasons, to limit rate increases. However, our costs, which are subject to market conditions and other factors, may increase significantly. The second largest component of our operating costs after water production is made up of salaries and wages. These costs are affected by the local supply and demand for qualified labor. Other large components of our costs are general insurance, workers compensation insurance, employee benefits and health insurance costs. These costs may increase disproportionately to rate increases authorized by the Commissions and may have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.Demand for our stock may fluctuate due to circumstances beyond our control.We believe that stockholders invest in public utility stocks, in part, because they seek reliable dividend payments. If there is an over-supply of stock of public utilities in the market relative to demand by such investors, the trading price of our securities could decrease. Additionally, if interest rates rise above the dividend yield offered by our equity securities, demand for our stock, and consequently its market price, may decrease. A decline in demand for our stock may have a negative impact on our ability to finance capital projects.29Table of ContentsAdverse investment returns and other factors may increase our pension liability and pension funding requirements.A substantial number of our employees are covered by a defined benefit pension plan. At present, the pension plan is underfunded because our projected pension benefit obligation exceeds the aggregate fair value of plan assets. Under applicable law, we are required to make cash contributions to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding levels imposed by regulatory requirements. The amount of such required cash contribution is based on an actuarial valuation of the plan. The funded status of the plan can be affected by investment returns on plan assets, discount rates, mortality rates of plan participants, pension reform legislation and a number of other factors. There can be no assurance that the value of our pension plan assets will be sufficient to cover future liabilities. Although we contributed to our pension plan in recent years, it is possible that we could incur a pension liability adjustment, or could be required to make additional cash contributions to our pension plan, which would reduce the cash available for business and other needs.Labor relations matters could adversely affect our operating results.At December 31, 2021, 727 of our 1,182 total employees were union employees. Most of our unionized employees are represented by the Utility Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO, except certain engineering and laboratory employees who are represented by the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, AFL-CIO.We believe our labor relations are good, but in light of rising costs for health care and pensions, our current contract negotiations and those in the future may be difficult. Furthermore, changes in applicable law or regulations could have an adverse effect on management's negotiating position with respect to our currently unionized employees and/or employees that decide to unionize in the future. We are subject to a risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters as we negotiate with the unions to address these issues, which could affect our results of operations and financial condition. We can give no assurance that issues with our labor forces will be resolved favorably to us in the future or that we will not experience work stoppages.Our operations are geographically concentrated in California and this lack of diversification may negatively affect our operations.Although we own facilities in a number of states, over 91.9% of our operations are located in California. As a result, we are largely subject to weather, political, water supply, labor, energy cost, regulatory, and economic risks affecting California.We are also affected by the real property market in California. In order to grow our business, we may need to acquire additional real estate or rights to use real property owned by third parties, the cost of which tends to be higher and more volatile in California than in other states. The value of our assets in California may decline if there is a decline in the California real estate market that results in a significant decrease in real property values.Municipalities, water districts and other public agencies may condemn our property by eminent domain action.State statutes allow municipalities, water districts and other public agencies to own and operate water systems. These agencies are empowered to condemn water systems or real property owned by privately owned public utilities in certain circumstances and in compliance with California and federal law. Additionally, whenever a public agency constructs facilities to extend its utility system into the service area of a privately owned public utility, such an act may constitute the taking of property and require reimbursement to the public utility for its loss. If a public agency were to file an eminent domain lawsuit against us, we would incur substantial attorney’s fees, consultant and expert fees, and other costs in considering a challenge to the right to take our utility property and/or its valuation for just compensation, as well as such fees and costs in any subsequent litigation if necessary. If the public agency prevailed and acquired our utility property, we would be entitled to just compensation for our loss, but we would no longer have access to the condemned property or water system. Neither would we be entitled to any portion of revenue generated from the use of such asset going forward.General Risk Factors
We depend significantly on the services of the members of our management team, and the departure of any of those persons could cause our operating results to suffer.Our success depends significantly on the continued individual and collective contributions of our management team. The loss of the services of any member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business as our management team has knowledge of our industry and customers and would be difficult to replace.30Table of ContentsWe retain certain risks not covered by our insurance policies.We evaluate our risks and insurance coverage annually or more frequently if circumstances dictate. Our evaluation considers the costs, risks, and benefits of retaining versus insuring various risks as well as the availability of certain types of insurance coverage. Furthermore, we are also affected by increases in prices for insurance coverage; in particular, we have been, and will continue to be, affected by rising health insurance costs. Retained risks are associated with deductible limits, partial self-insurance programs, and insurance policy coverage ceilings. If we suffer an uninsured loss, we may be unable to pass all or any portion of the loss on to customers, because our rates are regulated by regulatory commissions. Consequently, uninsured losses may negatively affect our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will not face uninsured losses pertaining to the risks we have retained.Our enterprise risk management processes may not be effective in identifying and mitigating the risks to which we are subject, or in reducing the potential for losses in connection with such risks.Our enterprise risk management processes are designed to minimize or mitigate the risks to which we are subject, as well as any losses stemming from such risks. Although we seek to identify, measure, monitor, report, and control our exposure to such risks, and employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques in the process, those techniques are inherently limited in their ability to anticipate the existence or development of risks that are currently unknown and unanticipated. The ineffectiveness of our enterprise risk management processes in mitigating the impact of known risks or the emergence of previously unknown or unanticipated risks may result in our incurring losses in the future that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.The accuracy of our judgments and estimates about financial and accounting matters will affect our operating results and financial condition.We make certain estimates and judgments in preparing our financial statements regarding, among others:•the useful life of intangible rights;•the number of years to depreciate certain assets;•amounts to set aside for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory obsolescence and uninsured losses;•our legal exposure and the appropriate accrual for claims, including medical claims and workers' compensation claims;•future costs and assumptions for pensions and other postretirement benefits;•regulatory recovery of regulatory assets;•possible tax uncertainties; and•projected collections of WRAM and MCBA receivables.The quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments will have an impact on our operating results and financial condition.In addition, we must estimate unbilled revenues and costs as of the end of each accounting period. If our estimates are not accurate, we will be required to make an adjustment in a future period. Accounting rules permit us to use expense balancing accounts and memorandum accounts that include cost changes to us that are different from amounts incorporated into the rates approved by the Commissions. These accounts result in expenses and revenues being recognized in periods other than in which they occurred"
0,CWT,CALIFORNIA WATER SERVICE GP,2021-02-25,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
.In evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the following discussion of material risks, events and uncertainties that make an investment in us speculative or risky in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A manifestation of any of the following risks and uncertainties could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, materially and adversely affect our business, growth, reputation, prospects, operating and financial results, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and stock price. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors; our operations could also be affected by factors, events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. Therefore, you should not consider the following risks to be a complete statement of all the potential risks or uncertainties that we face.20Table of ContentsRisks Related to Our Regulatory EnvironmentOur business is heavily regulated by state and federal regulatory agencies and our financial viability depends upon our ability to recover costs from our customers through rates that must be approved by state public utility commissions.California Water Service Company, New Mexico Water Service Company, Washington Water Service Company and Hawaii Water Service Company, Inc., are regulated public utilities which provide water and water-related service to our customers. The rates that we charge our water customers are subject to the jurisdiction of the regulatory commissions in the states in which we operate. These Commissions may set water and water-related rates for each operating district independently because the systems are not interconnected. The Commissions authorize us to charge rates that they consider to be sufficient to recover normal operating expenses, to provide funds for adding new or replacing water infrastructure, and to allow us to earn what the Commissions consider to be a fair and reasonable return on invested capital.Our revenues and consequently our ability to meet our financial objectives are dependent upon the rates we are authorized to charge our customers by the Commissions and our ability to recover our costs in these rates. Our management uses forecasts, models and estimates in order to set rates that will provide a fair and reasonable return on our invested capital. While our rates must be approved by the Commissions, no assurance can be given that our forecasts, models and estimates will be correct or that the Commissions will agree with our forecasts, models and estimates. If our rates are set too low, our revenues may be insufficient to cover our operating expenses, capital expenditure requirements and desired dividend levels.We periodically file rate increase applications with the Commissions. The ensuing administrative and hearing process may be lengthy and costly. The decisions of the Commissions are beyond our control and we can provide no assurances that our rate increase requests will be granted by the Commissions. Even if approved, there is no guarantee that approval will be given in a timely manner or at a sufficient level to cover our expenses and provide a reasonable return on our investment. If the rate increase decisions are delayed, our earnings may be adversely affected. For example, the CPUC did not issue its decision on our 2018 GRC until December 2020, approximately one year later than expected, which caused some financial and operating uncertainty for the Company during 2020.Our evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets is subject to adjustment by regulatory agencies and any such adjustment could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Regulatory decisions may also impact prospective revenues and earnings, affect the timing of the recognition of revenues and expenses and may overturn past decisions used in determining our revenues and expenses. Our management continually evaluates the anticipated recovery of regulatory assets and revenues subject to refund and provides for allowances and/or reserves as deemed necessary. Current accounting procedures allow us to defer certain costs if we believe it is probable that we will be allowed to recover those costs through future rate increases. If the Commissions determined that a portion of our assets were not recoverable in customer rates, we may suffer an asset impairment which would require a write down in such asset's valuation which would be recorded through operations.If our assessment as to the probability of recovery through the ratemaking process is incorrect, the associated regulatory asset would be adjusted to reflect the change in our assessment or any regulatory disallowances. A change in our evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets or a regulatory disallowance of all or a portion of our cost could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.Regulatory agencies may disagree with our valuation and characterization of certain of our assets.If we determine that assets are no longer used or useful for utility operations, we may remove them from our rate base and subsequently sell those assets with any gain on sales accruing to the stockholders, subject to certain conditions. If the Commissions disagree with our characterization, there is a risk that the Commissions could determine that realized appreciation in property value should be awarded to customers rather than our stockholders.Changes in laws, rules and policies of our regulators or operating jurisdictions can significantly affect our business.Regulatory agencies may change their rules and policies for various reasons, including changes in the local political environment. Regulators are elected by popular vote or are appointed by elected officials, and the results of elections may change the long-established rules and policies of an agency dramatically. For example, in 2020 regulation regarding full decoupling WRAMs changed in California. Since 2008, the CPUC allowed full decoupling WRAMs. However, in 2020, the CPUC precluded companies from proposing full decoupling WRAMs in their next GRC filings. The decision by the CPUC to change its policy will affect our business beginning in 2023.21Table of ContentsWe rely on policies and regulations promulgated by the various state commissions in order to recover capital expenditures, maintain favorable treatment on gains from the sale of real property, offset certain production and operating costs, recover the cost of debt, maintain an optimal equity structure without over-leveraging, and have financial and operational flexibility to engage in non-regulated operations. If any of the Commissions with jurisdiction over us implements policies and regulations that do not allow us to accomplish some or all of the items listed above, our future operating results may be adversely affected.In addition, legislatures may repeal, relax or tighten existing laws, or enact new laws that impact the regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over our business or affect our business directly. If changes in existing laws or the implementation of new laws limit our ability to accomplish some of our business objectives, our future operating results may be adversely affected.Finally, local jurisdictions may impose new ordinances, laws, fees, and regulations that could increase costs or limit our operations in ways which impact future operating results. Cities may impose or amend franchise requirements, impose conditions on underground construction or land use, impose various taxes and fees, or restrict our hours for construction, among other things. In the last decade, more cities have imposed excavation moratoria or paving rules which has required more costly construction than anticipated.We expect environmental health and safety regulation to increase, resulting in higher operating costs in the future and the potential that the company fails to meet these regulatory standards.Our water and wastewater services are governed by various federal and state environmental protection, health and safety laws and regulations. Although we have a rigorous water quality assurance program in place, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to comply with all standards. If we violate any federal or state regulations or laws governing health and safety, we could be subject to substantial fines or otherwise sanctioned, subject to potential civil liability for damages, and our customers' trust in our operations ability could be eroded.Environmental health and safety laws are complex and change frequently. They tend to become more stringent over time. As new or stricter standards are introduced, they could increase our operating costs. Although we would likely seek permission to recover these costs through rate increases, we can give no assurance that the Commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs.We are required to test our water quality for certain chemicals and potential contaminants on a regular basis. If the test results indicate that our water exceeds allowable limits, we may be required either to commence treatment to remove the contaminant or to develop an alternate water source. Either of these results may be costly. Although we would likely seek permission to recover these through rate increases, there can be no assurance that the Commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs.Recent events in the utility sector, including those in Flint, Michigan and related to Pacific Gas and Electric Company in California, show that failure to meet one or more water quality, environmental, or safety standards can have severe effects on customer trust, regulatory treatment, or civil and criminal liability.New and/or more stringent water quality regulations could increase our operating costs.We are subject to water quality standards set by federal, state and local authorities that have the power to issue new regulations. Compliance with new regulations that are more stringent than current regulations could increase our operating costs. In August of 2009, the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment within the California Environmental Protection Agency changed the water quality standard for TCP in our water supply. The new standard requires us to have 0.0007 parts per billion or less of TCP in our California water supply. We have incurred costs associated with the compliance of the new TCP standard and expect to continue to incur costs in the future. In 2018, we received proceeds from a TCP settlement (see note 15 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements) that has been used to offset some of the compliance costs that we have incurred. Although we would likely seek permission to these additional costs through the GRC process, we can give no assurance that the CPUC would approve the recovery of these additional compliance costs.Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are two water contaminants of emerging concern. Although a water quality standard has yet to be set by federal or state regulators, preliminary testing and guidance from the California Environmental Protection Agency has affected our operations of some wells in California. We expect that a water quality standard will be set in the future and that we will incur costs to comply with the water quality standard. Cal Water has requested and been approved to use a memorandum account to track the incremental compliance costs in the future and we would likely seek permission to recover additional costs of compliance through rate increases; however, we can give no assurance that the CPUC would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs.22Table of ContentsLegislation and regulation designed to mitigate or adapt to climate change may impact our operations.Future legislation or regulation regarding climate change may restrict our operations or impose new costs on our business. Our operations depend on power provided by other public utilities and, in emergencies, power generated by our portable and fixed generators. If future legislation or regulation limits emissions from the power generation process, our cost of power may increase. Any increase in the cost of power will be passed along to our California customers through the MCBA or included in our cost of service paid by our customers as requested in our GRC filings in California.We have been and may in the future be party to environmental and product-related lawsuits which could result in us paying damages not covered by insurance.We have been and may be in the future, party to water contamination lawsuits, which may not be fully covered by insurance.The number of environmental and product-related lawsuits against other water utilities have increased in frequency in recent years. If we are subject to additional environmental or product-related lawsuits, we might incur significant legal costs and it is uncertain whether we would be able to recover the legal costs from customers or other third parties. In addition, if current California law regarding CPUC's preemptive jurisdiction over regulated public utilities for claims about compliance with California Department of Health Services and United States EPA water quality standards changes, our legal exposure may be significantly increased.Risks Related to Our Business OperationsThe Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic May Adversely Affect Our OperationsAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a significant impact on our business in 2020, we are unable to accurately predict the full impact that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration and severity of the outbreak, potential resurgence and /or mutations of the virus, and the development, distribution and public acceptance of treatments and vaccines. As an “essential business” during times of emergencies pursuant to the U.S. Critical Infrastructures Protection Act of 2001, we are working to continue to provide high quality water and wastewater services to our two million customers. During the course of 2020, shelter-in-place and social distancing ordinances of varying durations and scope were implemented in all of the states in which we operate. Such governmental orders resulted in temporary closures of non-essential businesses and self-quarantining on non-essential workers. If we close any of our facilities due to a COVID-19 outbreak or if a critical number of our employees become too ill to work, our business operations could be materially adversely affected in a rapid manner. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant disruption to economic activity and the states in which the Company operates have experienced significant increases in unemployment claims and business closures. The Company has also ceased all shutoffs for nonpayment during the pandemic. If a significant number of customers are unable to pay utility bills for an extended period of time our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be materially adversely affected.We may be at risk for litigation under the principle of inverse condemnation for activities in the normal course of business which have a damaging effect on private property.The California constitution may allow compensation to property owners for a public utility taking or damaging private property, even when damage occurs through no fault of the utility and regardless of whether the damage could be foreseen by the utility. As a result, this doctrine, which is known as inverse condemnation and is routinely invoked in California, imposes strict liability for damages, including legal fees, as a result of the design, construction and maintenance of utility facilities. In addition to claims that our water or wastewater systems damaged property, Cal Water could be sued under inverse condemnation if its facilities or operations damage private property or if it is unable to timely deliver sufficient quantities of water for firefighting because of system capacity limitations or water supply disruptions, including as a result of action taken by an electric utility pursuant to a PSPS program or other loss of power. Although the imposition of liability is premised on the assumption that utilities have the ability to recover these costs from their customers, there is no assurance that the CPUC would allow Cal Water to recover any such damage awards from customers. For example, in December 2017, the CPUC denied recovery of costs that San Diego Gas & Electric Company incurred as a result of inverse condemnation, holding that the inverse condemnation principles of strict liability are not relevant to the CPUC’s prudent manager standard.23Table of ContentsThe effects of natural disasters, attacks by third parties, pandemics, or poor water quality or contamination to our water supply may result in disruption in our services and litigation which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.We operate in areas that are prone to earthquakes, fires, mudslides and other natural disasters. A significant seismic event or other natural disaster in California where our operations are concentrated could adversely impact our ability to deliver water and adversely affect our costs of operations. A major disaster could damage or destroy substantial capital assets. The CPUC has historically allowed utilities to establish a catastrophic event memorandum account as another possible mechanism to recover costs. However, we can give no assurance that the CPUC or any other commission would allow any such cost recovery mechanism in the future.Our water supplies are subject to contamination, including contamination from the development of naturally-occurring compounds, chemicals in groundwater systems, pollution resulting from man-made sources, such as TCP, sea water incursion and possible third-party attacks, including physical attacks, terrorist attacks, and cyber attacks. If our water supply is contaminated, we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water source. In addition, we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities, or development of new treatment methods. If we are unable to substitute water supply from an uncontaminated water source, or to adequately treat the contaminated water source in a cost-effective manner, there may be an adverse effect on our revenues, operating results and financial condition. The costs we incur to decontaminate a water source or an underground water system could be significant and may not be recoverable in rates. We could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances in our water supplies or other environmental damage. For example, private plaintiffs have the right to bring personal injury or other toxic tort claims arising from the presence of hazardous substances in our drinking water supplies. Our insurance policies may not be sufficient to cover the costs of these claims.We have taken steps to increase security measures at our facilities and heighten employee awareness of threats to our water supply, to protect against third-party attacks, including physical attacks, terrorist attacks and cyber attacks. We have also tightened our security measures regarding the delivery and handling of certain chemicals used in our business. We have and will continue to bear increased costs for security precautions to protect our facilities, operations and supplies. These costs may be significant. Despite these tightened security measures, we may not be in a position to control the outcome of third-party attacks should they occur.We depend upon our skilled and trained workforce to ensure water delivery. Were a pandemic to occur, we can give no assurance that we would be able to maintain sufficient human resources to ensure uninterrupted service in all of the districts that we serve.If any of these catastrophic events were to occur, we can give no assurance that our emergency preparedness plans would be adequate and that we would respond effectively, which could result in public or employee harm.Failure of critical elements of our infrastructure could result in interruption of service, damage to others, or injuries, and could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.We own physical infrastructure which was installed over a long period of time both underground and above-ground. This infrastructure is subject to potential failure due to age, operating conditions, or other unknown factors. Failure of any of our facilities could cause flooding, loss of service to our customers, contamination from chemicals we use in operations, or other damages.We operate a dam. If the dam were to fail for any reason, we would lose a water supply and flooding likely would occur. Whether or not we were responsible for the dam's failure, we could be sued. We can give no assurance that we would be able to successfully defend such a suit.We operate several water and wastewater treatment plants. If a major failure of these facilities were to occur, we would have an interruption in service, potential flooding, and could release potentially harmful material into the environment.We operate over 7,000 miles of underground pipeline. Some failures of underground pipelines could release chemicals into the environment which have a negative impact on sensitive habitats.24Table of ContentsWe rely on our information technology (""IT"") and a number of complex business systems to assist with the management of our business and customer and supplier relationships, and a disruption of these systems could adversely affect our business.Our IT systems are an integral part of our business, and a serious disruption of our IT systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently, which, in turn, could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and adversely affect our results of operations. We depend on our IT systems to bill customers, process orders, provide customer service, manage construction projects, manage our financial records, track assets, remotely monitor certain of our plants and facilities and manage human resources, inventory and accounts receivable collections. Our IT systems also enable us to purchase products from our suppliers and bill customers on a timely basis, maintain cost-effective operations and provide service to our customers. Some of our mission and business critical IT systems are older, such as our SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system. The steps we have taken to protect our IT systems may be insufficient to protect them from damage or interruption from:•power loss, computer systems failures, and internet, telecommunications or data network failures;•operator negligence or improper operation by, or supervision of, employees;•physical and electronic loss of customer data due to security breaches, cyber attacks, misappropriation and similar events;•computer viruses;•intentional security breaches, hacking, denial of services actions, misappropriation of data, and similar events, including intentional cyber security breaches aimed at disrupting and interfering with water treatment processes; and•earthquakes, floods, fires, mudslides and other natural disasters or physical attacks.These events may result in physical and/or electronic loss of customer or financial data, security breaches, misappropriation and other adverse consequences, including liability or regulatory penalties under data privacy laws and regulations. In addition, the lack of redundancy for certain of our IT systems, including billing systems, could exacerbate the impact of any of these events on us.In addition, we may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our business, and we might lack sufficient resources to make the necessary upgrades or replacements of our outdated existing technology to allow us to continue to operate at our current level of efficiency.The adequacy of our water supplies depends upon a variety of factors beyond our control. Interruption in the water supply may adversely affect our reputation and earnings.We depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and future needs of our customers. Whether we have an adequate supply varies depending upon a variety of factors, many of which are partially or completely beyond our control, including:•the amount of rainfall;•the amount of water stored in reservoirs;•underground water supply from which well water is pumped;•availability from water wholesalers;•changes in the amount of water used by our customers;•water quality and availability of appropriate treatment technology;•legal limitations on water use such as rationing restrictions during a drought;•changes in prevailing weather patterns and climate; and•population growth.25Table of ContentsWe purchase our water supply from various governmental agencies and others. Water supply availability may be affected by weather conditions, funding and other political and environmental considerations. In addition, our ability to use surface water is subject to regulations regarding water quality and volume limitations. If new regulations are imposed or existing regulations are changed or given new interpretations, the availability of surface water may be materially reduced. A reduction in surface water could result in the need to procure more costly water from other sources, thereby increasing our water production costs and adversely affecting our operating results if not recovered in rates on a timely basis.We have entered into long-term water supply agreements, which commit us to making certain minimum payments whether or not we purchase any water. Therefore, if demand is insufficient to use our required purchases we would have to pay for water we did not receive.From time to time, we enter into water supply agreements with third parties and our business is dependent upon such agreements in order to meet regional demand. For example, we have entered into a water supply contract with the SFPUC that expires on June 30, 2034. We can give no assurance that the SFPUC, or any of the other parties from whom we purchase water, will renew our contracts upon expiration, or that we will not be subject to significant price increases under any such renewed contracts.The parties from whom we purchase water maintain significant infrastructure and systems to deliver water to us. Maintenance of these facilities is beyond our control. If these facilities are not adequately maintained or if these parties otherwise default on their obligations to supply water to us, we may not have adequate water supplies to meet our customers' needs.If we are unable to access adequate water supplies, we may be unable to satisfy all customer demand, which could result in rationing. Rationing may have an adverse effect on cash flow from operations. We can make no guarantee that we will always have access to an adequate supply of water that will meet all required quality standards. Water shortages may affect us in a variety of ways. For example, shortages could:•adversely affect our supply mix by causing us to rely on more expensive purchased water;•adversely affect operating costs;•increase the risk of contamination to our systems due to our inability to maintain sufficient pressure; and•increase capital expenditures for building pipelines to connect to alternative sources of supply, new wells to replace those that are no longer in service or are otherwise inadequate to meet the needs of our customers and reservoirs and other facilities to conserve or reclaim water.We may or may not be able to recover increased operating and construction costs on a timely basis, or at all, for our regulated systems through the ratemaking process. Although we can give no assurance, we may be able to recover certain of these costs from third parties that may be responsible, or potentially responsible, for groundwater contamination.Our water supplies and other aspects of our operations may be affected by climate change.There is strong scientific consensus that human activity including carbon and methane emissions is impacting many planetary systems such as the heat-trapping capacity of the atmosphere; ocean temperature, circulation, acidity, and volume; weather patterns including the severity and frequency of severe weather events; ambient temperatures; and planetary ice cover. Because scientific investigations have been focused globally, there is tremendous uncertainty over the timing, extent, and types of impacts global climate change may have on our service areas and in our water supplies. Moreover, studies of tree ring data show long periods of drought conditions have occurred prior to significant human impacts in California and prior to our operation. Finally, in the last fifty years, California has experienced at least three severe multi-year droughts. Thus, we plan for water reliability and water shortages including projected and potential climate change risks in our water supply planning activities. Several anticipated impacts of climate change we consider in these plans which could impact our service areas are a greater percentage of state precipitation falling as rain rather than snow, changes in the frequency and volume of precipitation, hotter summer temperatures increasing demand for outdoor irrigation, and sea level rise increasing the likelihood of seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers. We also periodically review the climate change plans of our wholesalers to determine whether alternative supplies may be necessary in the future. However, we can give no assurance that replacement water supplies will be available at a reasonable cost or a cost acceptable to our customers and Commissions.26Table of ContentsNatural disasters, climate change, and other factors may change the population in our service areas.In the event that some outside factor such as a wildfire, flood, changed climate pattern, actual or threatened public health emergency or change in the local economy reduces or eliminates our customer base in a service area, we could face unrecoverable costs. In those circumstances the remaining customers might not be able to pay for the operating costs or capital costs of the water system. The company may not be able to recover capital costs of property which is no longer used and useful in utility service. Although we would likely seek permission to recover these costs through rate increases on remaining customers or in statewide rates, we can give no assurance that the Commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these costs.Wastewater operations entail significant risks.Wastewater collection and treatment involve many risks associated with damage to the environment, and we anticipate that wastewater collection and treatment will become an increasing significant part of our business. If collection or treatment systems fail or do not operate properly, untreated or partially treated wastewater could discharge onto property or into nearby streams and rivers, causing property damage or injury to aquatic life, or even human life. Liabilities resulting from such damage could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Demand for our water is subject to various factors and is affected by seasonal fluctuations.Demand for our water during the warmer, dry months is generally greater than during cooler or rainy months due primarily to additional requirements for water in connection with irrigation systems, swimming pools, cooling systems and other outside water use. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically warmer months, demand will vary with temperature and rainfall levels. If temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal, or if there is more rainfall than normal, the demand for our water may decrease. Under the WRAM mechanism, lower water usage in our California operations impacts our cash flows in the year of usage, but results in higher cash flows in the following years.In addition, governmental restrictions on water usage during drought conditions may result in a decreased demand for our water, even if our water reserves are sufficient to serve our customers during these drought conditions. The Commissions may not allow surcharges to collect lost revenues caused by customers' conservation during a drought. Regardless of whether we may surcharge our customers during a conservation period, they may use less water even after a drought has passed because of conservation patterns developed during the drought. Furthermore, our customers may wish to use recycled water as a substitute for potable water. If rights are granted to others to serve our customers recycled water, there will likely be a decrease in demand for our water.Finally, changes in prevailing weather patterns due to climate change may affect customer demand. If increased ambient temperatures affect our service areas, water used for irrigation and cooling may increase. If rainfall patterns change, our customers may change their patterns of water use including the amount of outdoor irrigation and the type of landscape they install. Government agencies may also mandate changes to customer irrigation or landscape patterns in response to changes in weather and climate.Changes in water supply costs impact our operations.The cost to obtain water for delivery to our customers varies depending on the sources of supply, wholesale suppliers' prices, the quality of water required to be treated and the quantity of water produced to fulfill customer water demand. Our source of supply varies among our operating districts. Certain districts obtain all of their supply from wells; some districts purchase all of the supply from wholesale suppliers; and other districts obtain the supply from a combination of wells and wholesale suppliers. A small portion of supply comes from surface sources and is processed through Company-owned water treatment plants. On average, slightly more than half of the water we deliver to our customers is pumped from wells or received from a surface supply with the remainder purchased from wholesale suppliers. Water purchased from suppliers usually costs us more than surface supplied or well pumped water. The cost of purchased water for delivery to customers represented 35.0% and 34.5% of our total operating costs in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Water purchased from suppliers will require renewal of our contracts upon expiration and may result in significant price increases under any such renewed contracts.Wholesale water suppliers may increase their prices for water delivered to us based on factors that affect their operating costs. Purchased water rate increases are beyond our control. In California, effective July 1, 2008, our ability to recover increases in the cost of purchased water changed with the adoption of the MCBA. With this change, actual purchased water costs are compared to authorized purchased water costs, with variances netted against the variances in purchased power, pump tax, and metered revenue, being recorded to revenue. The balance in the MCBA will be collected in the future by billing the net WRAM and MCBA accounts receivable balances over 12, 18, and 18+ month periods, which may have a short-term negative impact on cash flow.27Table of ContentsDependency upon adequate supply of electricity, certain chemicals, and third-party suppliers of parts and skilled labor could adversely affect our results of operations.Purchased electrical power is required to operate the wells and pumps needed to supply water to our customers. Although there are back-up power generators to operate a number of wells and pumps in emergencies, an extended interruption in power could impact the ability to supply water. In the past, California has been subject to rolling power blackouts due to insufficient power supplies. There is no assurance we will not be subject to power blackouts in the future. Additionally, we require sufficient amounts of certain chemicals in order to treat the water we supply. There are multiple sources for these chemicals but an extended interruption of supply could adversely affect our ability to adequately treat our water.Purchased power is a significant operating expense. During 2020 and 2019, purchased power expense represented 5.2% and 5.1%, respectively, of our total operating costs. These costs are beyond our control and can change unpredictably and substantially as occurred in California during 2001 when rates paid for electricity increased 48%. As with purchased water, purchased power costs are included in the MCBA. Cash flows between rate filings may be adversely affected until the Commission authorizes a rate change, but earnings will be minimally impacted. Cost of chemicals used in the delivery of water is not an element of the MCBA, and therefore, variances in quantity or cost could impact the results of operations.We rely on outside contractors to supply us with materials and parts critical to the operation of our systems. Should parts and material become unavailable, or should the cost of necessary supplies rise substantially, it could adversely affect our ability to operate or have financial impacts which are not recoverable through a regulatory process.We also rely on outside contractors to complete large construction projects and provide emergency maintenance services. In the event these contractors are unavailable or cannot meet the demands imposed on them, we may face significantly lengthy interruptions of service or delays in constructing capital projects. We may face additional costs to acquire more resources to complete these activities. Our business requires significant capital expenditures to replace or improve aging infrastructure that are dependent on our ability to secure appropriate funding. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital or if the rates at which we borrow increase, there would be a negative impact on our results of operations.The water utility business is capital-intensive. We invest significant funds to replace or improve aging infrastructure such as property, plant and equipment. In addition, water shortages may adversely affect us by causing us to rely on more purchased water. This could cause increases in capital expenditures needed to build pipelines to secure alternative water sources. In addition, we require capital to grow our business through acquisitions. We fund our short-term capital requirements from cash received from operations and funds received from developers. We also borrow funds from banks under short-term bank lending arrangements. We seek to meet our long-term capital needs by raising equity through common or preferred stock issues or issuing debt obligations. We cannot give any assurance that these sources will continue to be adequate or that the cost of funds will remain at levels permitting us to earn a reasonable rate of return. In the event we are unable to obtain sufficient capital, our expansion efforts could be curtailed, which may affect our growth and may affect our future results of operations.Our ability to access the capital markets is affected by the ratings of certain of our debt securities. Standard & Poor's Rating Agency issues a rating on California Water Service Company's ability to repay certain debt obligations. The credit rating agency could downgrade our credit rating based on reviews of our financial performance and projections or upon the occurrence of other events that could impact our business outlook. Lower ratings by the agency could restrict our ability to access equity and debt capital. We can give no assurance that the rating agency will maintain ratings which allow us to borrow under advantageous conditions and at reasonable interest rates. A future downgrade by the agency could also increase our cost of capital by causing potential investors to require a higher interest rate due to a perceived risk related to our ability to repay outstanding debt obligations.While the majority of our debt is long term at fixed rates, we do have interest rate exposure in our short-term borrowings which have variable interest rates. We are also subject to interest rate risks on new financings. However, if interest rates were to increase on a long-term basis, our management believes that customer rates would increase accordingly, subject to approval by the appropriate commission. We can give no assurance that the Commission would approve such an increase in customer rates.We are obligated to comply with specified debt covenants under certain of our loan and debt agreements. Failure to maintain compliance with these covenants could limit future borrowing, and we could face increased borrowing costs, litigation, acceleration of maturity schedules, and cross default issues. Such actions by our creditors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.28Table of ContentsOur inability to access the capital or financial markets could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to meet long-term commitments. Changes in economic conditions in our markets could affect our customers' ability to pay for water services. Any of these could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.We rely on our current credit facilities to fund short-term liquidity needs if internal funds are not available from operations. Specifically, given the seasonal fluctuations in demand for our water we commonly draw on our credit facilities to meet our cash requirements at times in the year when demand is relatively low. We also may occasionally use letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facilities. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to draw on our credit facilities. Our access to funds under our credit facilities is dependent on the ability of our banks to meet their funding commitments.Many of our customers and suppliers also have exposure to risks that could affect their ability to meet payment and supply commitments. We operate in geographic areas that may be particularly susceptible to declines in the price of real property, which could result in significant declines in demand for our products and services. In the event that any of our significant customers or suppliers, or a significant number of smaller customers and suppliers, are adversely affected by these risks, we may face disruptions in supply, significant reductions in demand for our products and services, inability of customers to pay invoices when due, and other adverse effects that could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.Our operations and certain contracts for water distribution and treatment depend on the financial capability of state and local governments, and other municipal entities such as water districts. Major disruptions in the financial strength or operations of such entities, such as liquidity limitations, bankruptcy or insolvency, could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business and/or enforce our rights under contracts to which such entities are a party.We are a holding company that depends on cash flow from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock.As a holding company, we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries and our only significant assets are investments in those subsidiaries. 93.8% of our revenues are derived from the operations of California Water Service Company. As a result, we are dependent on cash flow from our subsidiaries, and California Water Service Company in particular, to meet our obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock.Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and generally have no obligation to pay any amounts due on California Water Service Group's debt or to provide California Water Service Group with funds for dividends. Although there are no contractual or regulatory restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us, the reasonableness of our capital structure is one of the factors considered by state and local regulatory agencies in their ratemaking determinations. Therefore, transfer of funds from our subsidiaries to us for the payment of our obligations or dividends may have an adverse effect on ratemaking determinations. Furthermore, our right to receive cash or other assets upon the liquidation or reorganization of a subsidiary is generally subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary. If we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries in a timely manner, we may be unable to meet our obligations or pay dividends.We can make dividend payments only from our surplus (the excess, if any, of our net assets over total paid-in capital) or if there is no surplus, the net profits for the current fiscal year or the fiscal year before which the dividend is declared. In addition, we can pay cash dividends only if after paying those dividends we would be able to pay our liabilities as they become due. Owners of our capital stock cannot force us to pay dividends and dividends will only be paid if and when declared by our board of directors. Our board of directors can elect at any time, and for an indefinite duration, not to declare dividends on our capital stock.An important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems. Risks associated with potential acquisitions, divestitures or restructurings may adversely affect us.We may seek to acquire or invest in other companies, technologies, services or products that complement our business. The execution of our growth strategy may expose us to different risks than those associated with our utility operations. We can give no assurance that we will succeed in finding attractive acquisition candidates or investments, or that we would be able to reach mutually agreeable terms with such parties. In addition, as consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water and wastewater industries, the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase to unacceptable levels and limit our ability to grow through acquisitions. If we are unable to find acquisition candidates or investments, our ability to grow may be limited.29Table of ContentsAcquisition and investment transactions may result in the issuance of our equity securities that could be dilutive if the acquisition or business opportunity does not develop in accordance with our business plan. They may also result in significant write-offs and an increase in our debt. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Any of these transactions could involve numerous additional risks, including one or more of the following:•problems integrating the acquired operations, personnel, technologies, physical and cyber security processes, or products with our existing businesses and products;•liabilities inherited from the acquired companies' prior business operations;•diversion of management time and attention from our core business to the acquired business;•failure to retain key technical, management, sales and other personnel of the acquired business;•difficulty in retaining relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired business; and•difficulty in obtaining required regulatory approvals.In addition, the businesses and other assets we acquire may not achieve the sales and profitability expected. The occurrence of one or more of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these or any other significant risks encountered.We may not be able to increase or sustain our recent growth rate, and we may not be able to manage our future growth effectively.We may be unable to continue to expand our business or manage future growth. To successfully manage our growth and handle the responsibilities of being a public company, we must effectively:•hire, train, integrate and manage additional qualified engineers for engineering design and construction activities, new business personnel, and financial and information technology personnel;•retain key management, augment our management team, and retain qualified and certified water and wastewater system operators;•implement and improve additional and existing administrative, financial and operations systems, procedures and controls;•expand our technological capabilities; and•manage multiple relationships with our customers, regulators, suppliers and other third parties.If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities, satisfy customer requirements, execute our business plan or respond to competitive pressures.We have a number of large-volume commercial and industrial customers and a significant decrease in consumption by one or more of these customers could have an adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows.Our billed revenues and cash flows from operations will decrease if a significant business or industrial customer terminates or materially reduces its use of our water. Approximately $154.9 million, or 22.2%, of our 2020 water utility revenues was derived from business and industrial customers. However, if any of our large business or industrial customers in California reduce or cease its consumption of our water, the impact to net operating income would be minimal to our operations due to the WRAM and MCBA, but could impact our cash flows. In Hawaii, we serve a number of large resorts which if their water usage was reduced or ceased could have a material impact to our Hawaii operation. The delay between such date and the effective date of the rate relief may be significant and could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.Our operating cost and costs of providing services may rise faster than our revenues.Our ability to increase rates over time is dependent upon approval of such rate increases by the Commissions, or in the case of the City of Hawthorne and the City of Commerce, the City Council, which may be inclined, for political or other reasons, to limit rate increases. However, our costs, which are subject to market conditions and other factors, may increase significantly. The second largest component of our operating costs after water production is made up of salaries and wages. These costs are affected by the local supply and demand for qualified labor. Other large components of our costs are general insurance, workers compensation insurance, employee benefits and health insurance costs. These costs may increase disproportionately to rate increases authorized by the Commissions and may have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.30Table of ContentsDemand for our stock may fluctuate due to circumstances beyond our control.We believe that stockholders invest in public utility stocks, in part, because they seek reliable dividend payments. If there is an over-supply of stock of public utilities in the market relative to demand by such investors, the trading price of our securities could decrease. Additionally, if interest rates rise above the dividend yield offered by our equity securities, demand for our stock, and consequently its market price, may also decrease. A decline in demand for our stock may have a negative impact on our ability to finance capital projects.Adverse investment returns and other factors may increase our pension liability and pension funding requirements.A substantial number of our employees are covered by a defined benefit pension plan. At present, the pension plan is underfunded because our projected pension benefit obligation exceeds the aggregate fair value of plan assets. Under applicable law, we are required to make cash contributions to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding levels imposed by regulatory requirements. The amount of such required cash contribution is based on an actuarial valuation of the plan. The funded status of the plan can be affected by investment returns on plan assets, discount rates, mortality rates of plan participants, pension reform legislation and a number of other factors. There can be no assurance that the value of our pension plan assets will be sufficient to cover future liabilities. Although we have made contributions to our pension plan in recent years, it is possible that we could incur a pension liability adjustment, or could be required to make additional cash contributions to our pension plan, which would reduce the cash available for business and other needs.Labor relations matters could adversely affect our operating results.At December 31, 2020, 743 of our 1,192 total employees were union employees. Most of our unionized employees are represented by the Utility Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO, except certain engineering and laboratory employees who are represented by the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, AFL-CIO.We believe our labor relations are good, but in light of rising costs for health care and pensions, our current contract negotiations and those in the future may be difficult. Furthermore, changes in applicable law or regulations could have an adverse effect on management's negotiating position with respect to our currently unionized employees and/or employees that decide to unionize in the future. We are subject to a risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters as we negotiate with the unions to address these issues, which could affect our results of operations and financial condition. We can give no assurance that issues with our labor forces will be resolved favorably to us in the future or that we will not experience work stoppages.Our operations are geographically concentrated in California and this lack of diversification may negatively impact our operations.Although we own facilities in a number of states, over 93.8% of our operations are located in California. As a result, we are largely subject to weather, political, water supply, labor, energy cost, regulatory and economic risks affecting California.We are also affected by the real property market in California. In order to grow our business, we may need to acquire additional real estate or rights to use real property owned by third parties, the cost of which tends to be higher and more volatile in California than in other states. The value of our assets in California may decline if there is a decline in the California real estate market which results in a significant decrease in real property values.Municipalities, water districts and other public agencies may condemn our property by eminent domain action.State statutes allow municipalities, water districts and other public agencies to own and operate water systems.  These agencies are empowered to condemn water systems or real property owned by privately owned public utilities in certain circumstances and in compliance with California and federal law. Additionally, whenever a public agency constructs facilities to extend its utility system into the service area of a privately owned public utility, such an act may constitute the taking of property and require reimbursement to the public utility for its loss. If a public agency were to file an eminent domain lawsuit against us, we would incur substantial attorney’s fees, consultant and expert fees and other costs in considering a challenge to the right to take our utility property and/or its valuation for just compensation, as well as such fees and costs in any subsequent litigation if necessary. If the public agency prevailed and acquired our utility property, we would be entitled to just compensation for our loss, but we would no longer have access to the condemned property or water system. Neither would we be entitled to any portion of revenue generated from the use of such asset going forward.31Table of ContentsGeneral Risk Factors
We depend significantly on the services of the members of our management team, and the departure of any of those persons could cause our operating results to suffer.Our success depends significantly on the continued individual and collective contributions of our management team. The loss of the services of any member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business as our management team has knowledge of our industry and customers and would be difficult to replace.We retain certain risks not covered by our insurance policies.We evaluate our risks and insurance coverage annually or more frequently if circumstances dictate. Our evaluation considers the costs, risks and benefits of retaining versus insuring various risks as well as the availability of certain types of insurance coverage. Furthermore, we are also affected by increases in prices for insurance coverage; in particular, we have been, and will continue to be, affected by rising health insurance costs. Retained risks are associated with deductible limits, partial self-insurance programs and insurance policy coverage ceilings. If we suffer an uninsured loss, we may be unable to pass all, or any portion, of the loss on to customers because our rates are regulated by regulatory commissions. Consequently, uninsured losses may negatively affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will not face uninsured losses pertaining to the risks we have retained.Our enterprise risk management processes may not be effective in identifying and mitigating the risks to which we are subject, or in reducing the potential for losses in connection with such risks.Our enterprise risk management processes are designed to minimize or mitigate the risks to which we are subject, as well as any losses stemming from such risks. Although we seek to identify, measure, monitor, report, and control our exposure to such risks, and employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques in the process, those techniques are inherently limited in their ability to anticipate the existence or development of risks that are currently unknown and unanticipated. The ineffectiveness of our enterprise risk management processes in mitigating the impact of known risks or the emergence of previously unknown or unanticipated risks may result in our incurring losses in the future that could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.The accuracy of our judgments and estimates about financial and accounting matters will impact our operating results and financial condition.We make certain estimates and judgments in preparing our financial statements regarding, among others:•the useful life of intangible rights;•the number of years to depreciate certain assets;•amounts to set aside for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory obsolescence and uninsured losses;•our legal exposure and the appropriate accrual for claims, including medical claims and workers' compensation claims;•future costs and assumptions for pensions and other postretirement benefits;•regulatory recovery of regulatory assets;•possible tax uncertainties; and•projected collections of WRAM and MCBA receivables.The quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments will have an impact on our operating results and financial condition.In addition, we must estimate unbilled revenues and costs as of the end of each accounting period. If our estimates are not accurate, we will be required to make an adjustment in a future period. Accounting rules permit us to use expense balancing accounts and memorandum accounts that include cost changes to us that are different from amounts incorporated into the rates approved by the Commissions. These accounts result in expenses and revenues being recognized in periods other than in which they occurred"
17,CWT,CALIFORNIA WATER SERVICE GP,2020-02-27,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
.If any of the following risks actually occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Risks Related to Our Regulatory EnvironmentOur business is heavily regulated by state and federal regulatory agencies and our financial viability depends upon our ability to recover costs from our customers through rates that must be approved by state public utility commissions.California Water Service Company, New Mexico Water Service Company, Washington Water Service Company and Hawaii Water Service Company, Inc., are regulated public utilities which provide water and water-related service to our customers. The rates that we charge our water customers are subject to the jurisdiction of the regulatory commissions in the states in which we operate. These Commissions may set water and water-related rates for each operating district independently because the systems are not interconnected. The Commissions authorize us to charge rates that they consider to be sufficient to recover normal operating expenses, to provide funds for adding new or replacing water infrastructure, and to allow us to earn what the Commissions consider to be a fair and reasonable return on invested capital.Our revenues and consequently our ability to meet our financial objectives are dependent upon the rates we are authorized to charge our customers by the Commissions and our ability to recover our costs in these rates. Our management uses forecasts, models and estimates in order to set rates that will provide a fair and reasonable return on our invested capital. While our rates must be approved by the Commissions, no assurance can be given that our forecasts, models and estimates will be correct or that the Commissions will agree with our forecasts, models and estimates. If our rates are set too low, our revenues may be insufficient to cover our operating expenses, capital expenditure requirements and desired dividend levels.We periodically file rate increase applications with the Commissions. The ensuing administrative and hearing process may be lengthy and costly. The decisions of the Commissions are beyond our control and we can provide no assurances that our rate increase requests will be granted by the Commissions. Even if approved, there is no guarantee that approval will be given in a timely manner or at a sufficient level to cover our expenses and provide a reasonable return on our investment. If the rate increase decisions are delayed, our earnings may be adversely affected. Specifically, the formal settlement agreement filed for our 2018 GRC with the Public Advocates Office of the CPUC is still pending, and the following issues are being litigated and were not included in the settlement: continuation of the WRAM and SRM, balancing accounts for pension and health care expenses, depreciation rates, working capital, AFUDC, and capital projects related to advanced metering. We can give no assurance that these litigated issues will be decided in our favor. Additionally, the CPUC will consider, but is not required to adopt, the settlement agreement. A final decision on the case had been expected in late 2019, with new rates going into effect on January 1, 2020. On December 19, 2019, the CPUC extended its statutory deadline to complete the proceeding by six months, to July 1, 2020. The CPUC will allow recovery of the difference between current rates and final rates adopted in the proceeding back to January 1, 2020. If the settlement is not approved or is approved on terms less favorable to us, or the litigated issues described above are not decided in our favor, this could have a material adverse impact on our revenue, operating results and earnings per share. Even if the settlement is approved on its terms, but the case is materially delayed, it could have a material adverse impact on our revenue, operating results, and earnings per share on an interim basis but would be reversed at the time of a final decision through recognition of interim rate recovery.Our evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets is subject to adjustment by regulatory agencies and any such adjustment could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Regulatory decisions may also impact prospective revenues and earnings, affect the timing of the recognition of revenues and expenses and may overturn past decisions used in determining our revenues and expenses. Our management continually evaluates the anticipated recovery of regulatory assets and revenues subject to refund and provides for allowances and/or reserves as deemed necessary. Current accounting procedures allow us to defer certain costs if we believe it is probable that we will be allowed to recover those costs through future rate increases. If the Commissions determined that a portion of our assets were not recoverable in customer rates, we may suffer an asset impairment which would require a write down in such asset's valuation which would be recorded through operations.If our assessment as to the probability of recovery through the ratemaking process is incorrect, the associated regulatory asset would be adjusted to reflect the change in our assessment or any regulatory disallowances. A change in our evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets or a regulatory disallowance of all or a portion of our cost could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.21Table of ContentsRegulatory agencies may disagree with our valuation and characterization of certain of our assets.If we determine that assets are no longer used or useful for utility operations, we may remove them from our rate base and subsequently sell those assets with any gain on sales accruing to the stockholders, subject to certain conditions. If the Commissions disagree with our characterization, there is a risk that the Commissions could determine that realized appreciation in property value should be awarded to customers rather than our stockholders.Changes in laws, rules and policies of regulatory agencies can significantly affect our business.Regulatory agencies may change their rules and policies for various reasons, including changes in the local political environment. Regulators are elected by popular vote or are appointed by elected officials, and the results of elections may change the long-established rules and policies of an agency dramatically. For example, in 2001 regulation regarding recovery of increases in electrical rates changed in California. For over 20 years prior to 2001, the CPUC allowed recovery of electric rate increases under its operating rules. However, in 2003, the CPUC reinstated its policy to allow utilities to adjust their rates for rate changes by the power companies. The original decision by the CPUC to change its policy, as well as its subsequent decision to reinstate that policy, affected our business.We rely on policies and regulations promulgated by the various state commissions in order to recover capital expenditures, maintain favorable treatment on gains from the sale of real property, offset certain production and operating costs, recover the cost of debt, maintain an optimal equity structure without over-leveraging, and have financial and operational flexibility to engage in non-regulated operations. If any of the Commissions with jurisdiction over us implements policies and regulations that do not allow us to accomplish some or all of the items listed above, our future operating results may be adversely affected.In addition, legislatures may repeal, relax or tighten existing laws, or enact new laws that impact the regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over our business or affect our business directly. If changes in existing laws or the implementation of new laws limit our ability to accomplish some of our business objectives, our future operating results may be adversely affected.We expect environmental health and safety regulation to increase, resulting in higher operating costs in the future.Our water and wastewater services are governed by various federal and state environmental protection, health and safety laws and regulations. These provisions establish criteria for drinking water and for discharges of water, wastewater and airborne substances. The EPA, state water quality regulators, and other state regulatory authorities promulgate numerous nationally and locally applicable standards, including maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for drinking water. We believe we are currently in compliance with all of the MCLs promulgated to date. Although we have a rigorous water quality assurance program in place, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to comply with all standards. If we violate any federal or state regulations or laws governing health and safety, we could be subject to substantial fines or otherwise sanctioned.Environmental health and safety laws are complex and change frequently. They tend to become more stringent over time. As new or stricter standards are introduced, they could increase our operating costs. Although we would likely seek permission to recover these costs through rate increases, we can give no assurance that the Commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs.We are required to test our water quality for certain chemicals and potential contaminants on a regular basis. If the test results indicate that our water exceeds allowable limits, we may be required either to commence treatment to remove the contaminant or to develop an alternate water source. Either of these results may be costly. Although we would likely seek permission to recover these through rate increases, there can be no assurance that the Commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs.New and/or more stringent water quality regulations could increase our operating costs.We are subject to water quality standards set by federal, state and local authorities that have the power to issue new regulations. Compliance with new regulations that are more stringent than current regulations could increase our operating costs. In August of 2009, the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment within the California Environmental Protection Agency changed the water quality standard for TCP in our water supply. The new standard requires us to have 0.0007 parts per billion or less of TCP in our California water supply. We have incurred costs associated with the compliance of the new TCP standard and expect to continue to incur costs in the future. In 2018, we received proceeds from a TCP settlement (see note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements) that has been used to offset some of the compliance costs that we have incurred. Although we would likely seek permission to these additional costs through the GRC process, we can give no assurance that the CPUC would approve the recovery of these additional compliance costs.Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are two water contaminants of emerging concern. Although a water quality standard has yet to be set by federal or state regulators, preliminary testing and guidance from Cal EPA 22Table of Contentshas affected our operations of some wells in California. We expect that a water quality standard will be set in the future and that we will incur costs to comply with the water quality standard. We would likely request a memorandum account to track the incremental compliance costs in the future and we would likely seek permission to recover additional costs of compliance through rate increases; however, we can give no assurance that the CPUC would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs.Legislation and regulation designed to mitigate or adapt to climate change may impact our operations.Future legislation or regulation regarding climate change may restrict our operations or impose new costs on our business. Our operations depend on power provided by other public utilities and, in emergencies, power generated by our portable and fixed generators. If future legislation or regulation limits emissions from the power generation process, our cost of power may increase. Any increase in the cost of power will be passed along to our California customers through the MCBA or included in our cost of service paid by our customers as requested in our GRC filings in California.Starting January 1, 2010, under the CEQA, all capital projects of a certain type (primarily wells, tanks, major pipelines and treatment facilities) require mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. The cost to prepare the CEQA documentation and permit will add an estimated ten thousand dollars to such capital projects. This cost will be included in our capital cost and added to our rate base, which will be requested to be paid for by our customers. Any increase in the operating cost of the facilities will also be included in our cost of service paid by our customers as requested in our GRC filings. Although we would likely seek permission to recover these costs through rate increases, we can give no assurance that the CPUC would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs. Cap and trade regulations were implemented in California in 2012 with the goal of reducing emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020. Although we would likely seek permission to recover these costs through rate increases, we can give no assurance that the CPUC would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs. We have been and may in the future be party to environmental and product-related lawsuits which could result in us paying damages not covered by insurance.We have been and may be in the future, party to water contamination lawsuits, which may not be fully covered by insurance.The number of environmental and product-related lawsuits against other water utilities have increased in frequency in recent years. If we are subject to additional environmental or product-related lawsuits, we might incur significant legal costs and it is uncertain whether we would be able to recover the legal costs from customers or other third parties. In addition, if current California law regarding CPUC's preemptive jurisdiction over regulated public utilities for claims about compliance with California Department of Health Services and United States EPA water quality standards changes, our legal exposure may be significantly increased.Risks Related to Our Business OperationsWe may be at risk for litigation under the principle of inverse condemnation for activities in the normal course of business which have a damaging effect on private property.The California constitution may allow compensation to property owners for a public utility taking or damaging private property, even when damage occurs through no fault of the utility and regardless of whether the damage could be foreseen by the utility. As a result, this doctrine, which is known as inverse condemnation and is routinely invoked in California, imposes strict liability for damages, including legal fees, as a result of the design, construction and maintenance of utility facilities. In addition to claims that our water or wastewater systems damaged property, Cal Water could be sued under inverse condemnation if its facilities or operations damage private property or if it is unable to timely deliver sufficient quantities of water for firefighting because of system capacity limitations or water supply disruptions, including as a result of action taken by an electric utility pursuant to a PSPS program or other loss of power. Although the imposition of liability is premised on the assumption that utilities have the ability to recover these costs from their customers, there is no assurance that the CPUC would allow Cal Water to recover any such damage awards from customers. For example, in December 2017, the CPUC denied recovery of costs that San Diego Gas & Electric Company incurred as a result of inverse condemnation, holding that the inverse condemnation principles of strict liability are not relevant to the CPUC’s prudent manager standard. In October 2019 the U.S. Supreme Court denied a writ of certiorari to review this decision. The effects of natural disasters, attacks by third parties, pandemics, or poor water quality or contamination to our water supply may result in disruption in our services and litigation which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.We operate in areas that are prone to earthquakes, fires, mudslides and other natural disasters. A significant seismic event or other natural disaster in California where our operations are concentrated could adversely impact our ability to deliver water 23Table of Contentsand adversely affect our costs of operations. A major disaster could damage or destroy substantial capital assets. The CPUC has historically allowed utilities to establish a catastrophic event memorandum account as another possible mechanism to recover costs. However, we can give no assurance that the CPUC or any other commission would allow any such cost recovery mechanism in the future.Our water supplies are subject to contamination, including contamination from the development of naturally-occurring compounds, chemicals in groundwater systems, pollution resulting from man-made sources, such as TCP, sea water incursion and possible third-party attacks, including physical attacks, terrorist attacks, and cyber attacks. If our water supply is contaminated, we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water source. In addition, we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities, or development of new treatment methods. If we are unable to substitute water supply from an uncontaminated water source, or to adequately treat the contaminated water source in a cost-effective manner, there may be an adverse effect on our revenues, operating results and financial condition. The costs we incur to decontaminate a water source or an underground water system could be significant and may not be recoverable in rates. We could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances in our water supplies or other environmental damage. For example, private plaintiffs have the right to bring personal injury or other toxic tort claims arising from the presence of hazardous substances in our drinking water supplies. Our insurance policies may not be sufficient to cover the costs of these claims.We operate a dam. If the dam were to fail for any reason, we would lose a water supply and flooding likely would occur. Whether or not we were responsible for the dam's failure, we could be sued. We can give no assurance that we would be able to successfully defend such a suit.In light of the threats to the nation's health and security ensuing in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, we have taken steps to increase security measures at our facilities and heighten employee awareness of threats to our water supply, to protect against third-party attacks, including physical attacks, terrorist attacks and cyber attacks. We have also tightened our security measures regarding the delivery and handling of certain chemicals used in our business. We have and will continue to bear increased costs for security precautions to protect our facilities, operations and supplies. These costs may be significant. Despite these tightened security measures, we may not be in a position to control the outcome of third-party attacks should they occur.We depend upon our skilled and trained workforce to ensure water delivery. Were a pandemic to occur, we can give no assurance that we would be able to maintain sufficient human resources to ensure uninterrupted service in all of the districts that we serve.If any of these catastrophic events were to occur, we can give no assurance that our emergency preparedness plans would be adequate and that we would respond effectively, which could result in public or employee harm.We rely on our information technology (""IT"") and a number of complex business systems to assist with the management of our business and customer and supplier relationships, and a disruption of these systems could adversely affect our business.Our IT systems are an integral part of our business, and a serious disruption of our IT systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently, which, in turn, could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and adversely affect our results of operations. We depend on our IT systems to bill customers, process orders, provide customer service, manage construction projects, manage our financial records, track assets, remotely monitor certain of our plants and facilities and manage human resources, inventory and accounts receivable collections. Our IT systems also enable us to purchase products from our suppliers and bill customers on a timely basis, maintain cost-effective operations and provide service to our customers. Some of our mission and business critical IT systems are older, such as our SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system. Although we do not believe that our IT systems are at a materially greater risk of cyber security incidents than other similar organizations, our IT systems remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from:•power loss, computer systems failures, and internet, telecommunications or data network failures;•operator negligence or improper operation by, or supervision of, employees;•physical and electronic loss of customer data due to security breaches, cyber attacks, misappropriation and similar events;•computer viruses;•intentional security breaches, hacking, denial of services actions, misappropriation of data and similar events; and•earthquakes, floods, fires, mudslides and other natural disasters or physical attacks.24Table of ContentsThese events may result in physical and/or electronic loss of customer or financial data, security breaches, misappropriation and other adverse consequences, including liability or regulatory penalties under data privacy laws and regulations. In addition, the lack of redundancy for certain of our IT systems, including billing systems, could exacerbate the impact of any of these events on us.In addition, we may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our business, and we might lack sufficient resources to make the necessary upgrades or replacements of our outdated existing technology to allow us to continue to operate at our current level of efficiency.The adequacy of our water supplies depends upon a variety of factors beyond our control. Interruption in the water supply may adversely affect our earnings.We depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and future needs of our customers. Whether we have an adequate supply varies depending upon a variety of factors, many of which are partially or completely beyond our control, including:•the amount of rainfall;•the amount of water stored in reservoirs;•underground water supply from which well water is pumped;•availability from water wholesalers;•changes in the amount of water used by our customers;•water quality and availability of appropriate treatment technology;•legal limitations on water use such as rationing restrictions during a drought;•changes in prevailing weather patterns and climate; and•population growth.We purchase our water supply from various governmental agencies and others. Water supply availability may be affected by weather conditions, funding and other political and environmental considerations. In addition, our ability to use surface water is subject to regulations regarding water quality and volume limitations. If new regulations are imposed or existing regulations are changed or given new interpretations, the availability of surface water may be materially reduced. A reduction in surface water could result in the need to procure more costly water from other sources, thereby increasing our water production costs and adversely affecting our operating results if not recovered in rates on a timely basis.We have entered into long-term water supply agreements, which commit us to making certain minimum payments whether or not we purchase any water. Therefore, if demand is insufficient to use our required purchases we would have to pay for water we did not receive.From time to time, we enter into water supply agreements with third parties and our business is dependent upon such agreements in order to meet regional demand. For example, we have entered into a water supply contract with the SFPUC that expires on June 30, 2034. We can give no assurance that the SFPUC, or any of the other parties from whom we purchase water, will renew our contracts upon expiration, or that we will not be subject to significant price increases under any such renewed contracts.The parties from whom we purchase water maintain significant infrastructure and systems to deliver water to us. Maintenance of these facilities is beyond our control. If these facilities are not adequately maintained or if these parties otherwise default on their obligations to supply water to us, we may not have adequate water supplies to meet our customers' needs.If we are unable to access adequate water supplies, we may be unable to satisfy all customer demand, which could result in rationing. Rationing may have an adverse effect on cash flow from operations. We can make no guarantee that we will always have access to an adequate supply of water that will meet all required quality standards. Water shortages may affect us in a variety of ways. For example, shortages could:•adversely affect our supply mix by causing us to rely on more expensive purchased water;•adversely affect operating costs;•increase the risk of contamination to our systems due to our inability to maintain sufficient pressure; and25Table of Contents•increase capital expenditures for building pipelines to connect to alternative sources of supply, new wells to replace those that are no longer in service or are otherwise inadequate to meet the needs of our customers and reservoirs and other facilities to conserve or reclaim water.We may or may not be able to recover increased operating and construction costs on a timely basis, or at all, for our regulated systems through the ratemaking process. Although we can give no assurance, we may be able to recover certain of these costs from third parties that may be responsible, or potentially responsible, for groundwater contamination.Our water supplies and other aspects of our operations may be affected by climate change.There is strong scientific consensus that human activity including carbon and methane emissions is impacting many planetary systems such as the heat-trapping capacity of the atmosphere; ocean temperature, circulation, acidity, and volume; weather patterns including the severity and frequency of severe weather events; ambient temperatures; and planetary ice cover. Because scientific investigations have been focused globally, there is tremendous uncertainty over the timing, extent, and types of impacts global climate change may have on our service areas and in our water supplies. Moreover, studies of tree ring data show long periods of drought conditions have occurred prior to significant human impacts in California and prior to our operation. Finally, in the last fifty years, California has experienced at least three severe multi-year droughts. Thus, we plan for water reliability and water shortages including projected and potential climate change risks in our water supply planning activities. Several anticipated impacts of climate change which could impact our service areas are a greater percentage of state precipitation falling as rain rather than snow, changes in the frequency and volume of precipitation, hotter summer temperatures increasing demand for outdoor irrigation, and sea level rise increasing the likelihood of seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers. We also periodically review the climate change plans of our wholesalers to determine whether alternative supplies may be necessary in the future. However, we can give no assurance that replacement water supplies will be available at a reasonable cost or a cost acceptable to our customers and Commissions.Natural disasters, climate change, and other factors may change the population in our service areas.In the event that some outside factor such as a wildfire, flood, changed climate pattern, actual or threatened public health emergency or change in the local economy reduces or eliminates our customer base in a service area, we could face unrecoverable costs. In those circumstances the remaining customers might not be able to pay for the operating costs or capital costs of the water system. The company may not be able to recover capital costs of property which is no longer used and useful in utility service. Although we would likely seek permission to recover these costs through rate increases on remaining customers or in statewide rates, we can give no assurance that the Commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these costs.Wastewater operations entail significant risks.Wastewater collection and treatment involve many risks associated with damage to the environment, and we anticipate that wastewater collection and treatment will become an increasing significant part of our business. If collection or treatment systems fail or do not operate properly, untreated or partially treated wastewater could discharge onto property or into nearby streams and rivers, causing property damage or injury to aquatic life, or even human life. Liabilities resulting from such damage could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Demand for our water is subject to various factors and is affected by seasonal fluctuations.Demand for our water during the warmer, dry months is generally greater than during cooler or rainy months due primarily to additional requirements for water in connection with irrigation systems, swimming pools, cooling systems and other outside water use. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically warmer months, demand will vary with temperature and rainfall levels. If temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal, or if there is more rainfall than normal, the demand for our water may decrease. Under the WRAM mechanism, lower water usage in our California operations impacts our cash flows in the year of usage, but results in higher cash flows in the following years.In addition, governmental restrictions on water usage during drought conditions may result in a decreased demand for our water, even if our water reserves are sufficient to serve our customers during these drought conditions. The Commissions may not allow surcharges to collect lost revenues caused by customers' conservation during a drought. Regardless of whether we may surcharge our customers during a conservation period, they may use less water even after a drought has passed because of conservation patterns developed during the drought. Furthermore, our customers may wish to use recycled water as a substitute for potable water. If rights are granted to others to serve our customers recycled water, there will likely be a decrease in demand for our water.Finally, changes in prevailing weather patterns due to climate change may affect customer demand. If increased ambient temperatures affect our service areas, water used for irrigation and cooling may increase. If rainfall patterns change, our customers 26Table of Contentsmay change their patterns of water use including the amount of outdoor irrigation and the type of landscape they install. Government agencies may also mandate changes to customer irrigation or landscape patterns in response to changes in weather and climate.Changes in water supply costs impact our operations.The cost to obtain water for delivery to our customers varies depending on the sources of supply, wholesale suppliers' prices, the quality of water required to be treated and the quantity of water produced to fulfill customer water demand. Our source of supply varies among our operating districts. Certain districts obtain all of their supply from wells; some districts purchase all of the supply from wholesale suppliers; and other districts obtain the supply from a combination of wells and wholesale suppliers. A small portion of supply comes from surface sources and is processed through Company-owned water treatment plants. On average, slightly more than half of the water we deliver to our customers is pumped from wells or received from a surface supply with the remainder purchased from wholesale suppliers. Water purchased from suppliers usually costs us more than surface supplied or well pumped water. The cost of purchased water for delivery to customers represented 34.5% and 35.2% of our total operating costs in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Water purchased from suppliers will require renewal of our contracts upon expiration and may result in significant price increases under any such renewed contracts.Wholesale water suppliers may increase their prices for water delivered to us based on factors that affect their operating costs. Purchased water rate increases are beyond our control. In California, effective July 1, 2008, our ability to recover increases in the cost of purchased water changed with the adoption of the MCBA. With this change, actual purchased water costs are compared to authorized purchased water costs, with variances netted against the variances in purchased power, pump tax, and metered revenue, being recorded to revenue. The balance in the MCBA will be collected in the future by billing the net WRAM and MCBA accounts receivable balances over 12, 18, and 18+ month periods, which may have a short-term negative impact on cash flow.Dependency upon adequate supply of electricity and certain chemicals could adversely affect our results of operations.Purchased electrical power is required to operate the wells and pumps needed to supply water to our customers. Although there are back-up power generators to operate a number of wells and pumps in emergencies, an extended interruption in power could impact the ability to supply water. In the past, California has been subject to rolling power blackouts due to insufficient power supplies. There is no assurance we will not be subject to power blackouts in the future. Additionally, we require sufficient amounts of certain chemicals in order to treat the water we supply. There are multiple sources for these chemicals but an extended interruption of supply could adversely affect our ability to adequately treat our water.Purchased power is a significant operating expense. During 2019 and 2018, purchased power expense represented 5.1% and 5.3%, respectively, of our total operating costs. These costs are beyond our control and can change unpredictably and substantially as occurred in California during 2001 when rates paid for electricity increased 48%. As with purchased water, purchased power costs are included in the MCBA. Cash flows between rate filings may be adversely affected until the Commission authorizes a rate change, but earnings will be minimally impacted. Cost of chemicals used in the delivery of water is not an element of the MCBA, and therefore, variances in quantity or cost could impact the results of operations.Our business requires significant capital expenditures to replace or improve aging infrastructure that are dependent on our ability to secure appropriate funding. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital or if the rates at which we borrow increase, there would be a negative impact on our results of operations.The water utility business is capital-intensive. We invest significant funds to replace or improve aging infrastructure such as property, plant and equipment. In addition, water shortages may adversely affect us by causing us to rely on more purchased water. This could cause increases in capital expenditures needed to build pipelines to secure alternative water sources. In addition, we require capital to grow our business through acquisitions. We fund our short-term capital requirements from cash received from operations and funds received from developers. We also borrow funds from banks under short-term bank lending arrangements. We seek to meet our long-term capital needs by raising equity through common or preferred stock issues or issuing debt obligations. We cannot give any assurance that these sources will continue to be adequate or that the cost of funds will remain at levels permitting us to earn a reasonable rate of return. In the event we are unable to obtain sufficient capital, our expansion efforts could be curtailed, which may affect our growth and may affect our future results of operations.Our ability to access the capital markets is affected by the ratings of certain of our debt securities. Standard & Poor's Rating Agency issues a rating on California Water Service Company's ability to repay certain debt obligations. The credit rating agency could downgrade our credit rating based on reviews of our financial performance and projections or upon the occurrence of other events that could impact our business outlook. Lower ratings by the agency could restrict our ability to access equity and debt capital. We can give no assurance that the rating agency will maintain ratings which allow us to borrow under advantageous conditions and at reasonable interest rates. A future downgrade by the agency could also increase our cost of capital by causing potential investors to require a higher interest rate due to a perceived risk related to our ability to repay outstanding debt obligations.27Table of ContentsWhile the majority of our debt is long term at fixed rates, we do have interest rate exposure in our short-term borrowings which have variable interest rates. We are also subject to interest rate risks on new financings. However, if interest rates were to increase on a long-term basis, our management believes that customer rates would increase accordingly, subject to approval by the appropriate commission. We can give no assurance that the Commission would approve such an increase in customer rates.We are obligated to comply with specified debt covenants under certain of our loan and debt agreements. Failure to maintain compliance with these covenants could limit future borrowing, and we could face increased borrowing costs, litigation, acceleration of maturity schedules, and cross default issues. Such actions by our creditors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Our inability to access the capital or financial markets could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to meet long-term commitments. Changes in economic conditions in our markets could affect our customers' ability to pay for water services. Any of these could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.We rely on our current credit facilities to fund short-term liquidity needs if internal funds are not available from operations. Specifically, given the seasonal fluctuations in demand for our water we commonly draw on our credit facilities to meet our cash requirements at times in the year when demand is relatively low. We also may occasionally use letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facilities. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to draw on our credit facilities. Our access to funds under our credit facilities is dependent on the ability of our banks to meet their funding commitments.Many of our customers and suppliers also have exposure to risks that could affect their ability to meet payment and supply commitments. We operate in geographic areas that may be particularly susceptible to declines in the price of real property, which could result in significant declines in demand for our products and services. In the event that any of our significant customers or suppliers, or a significant number of smaller customers and suppliers, are adversely affected by these risks, we may face disruptions in supply, significant reductions in demand for our products and services, inability of customers to pay invoices when due, and other adverse effects that could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.Our operations and certain contracts for water distribution and treatment depend on the financial capability of state and local governments, and other municipal entities such as water districts. Major disruptions in the financial strength or operations of such entities, such as liquidity limitations, bankruptcy or insolvency, could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business and/or enforce our rights under contracts to which such entities are a party.We are a holding company that depends on cash flow from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock.As a holding company, we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries and our only significant assets are investments in those subsidiaries. 93.8% of our revenues are derived from the operations of California Water Service Company. As a result, we are dependent on cash flow from our subsidiaries, and California Water Service Company in particular, to meet our obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock.Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and generally have no obligation to pay any amounts due on California Water Service Group's debt or to provide California Water Service Group with funds for dividends. Although there are no contractual or regulatory restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us, the reasonableness of our capital structure is one of the factors considered by state and local regulatory agencies in their ratemaking determinations. Therefore, transfer of funds from our subsidiaries to us for the payment of our obligations or dividends may have an adverse effect on ratemaking determinations. Furthermore, our right to receive cash or other assets upon the liquidation or reorganization of a subsidiary is generally subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary. If we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries in a timely manner, we may be unable to meet our obligations or pay dividends.We can make dividend payments only from our surplus (the excess, if any, of our net assets over total paid-in capital) or if there is no surplus, the net profits for the current fiscal year or the fiscal year before which the dividend is declared. In addition, we can pay cash dividends only if after paying those dividends we would be able to pay our liabilities as they become due. Owners of our capital stock cannot force us to pay dividends and dividends will only be paid if and when declared by our board of directors. Our board of directors can elect at any time, and for an indefinite duration, not to declare dividends on our capital stock.28Table of ContentsAn important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems. Risks associated with potential acquisitions, divestitures or restructurings may adversely affect us.We may seek to acquire or invest in other companies, technologies, services or products that complement our business. The execution of our growth strategy may expose us to different risks than those associated with our utility operations. We can give no assurance that we will succeed in finding attractive acquisition candidates or investments, or that we would be able to reach mutually agreeable terms with such parties. In addition, as consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water and wastewater industries, the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase to unacceptable levels and limit our ability to grow through acquisitions. If we are unable to find acquisition candidates or investments, our ability to grow may be limited.Acquisition and investment transactions may result in the issuance of our equity securities that could be dilutive if the acquisition or business opportunity does not develop in accordance with our business plan. They may also result in significant write-offs and an increase in our debt. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Any of these transactions could involve numerous additional risks, including one or more of the following:•problems integrating the acquired operations, personnel, technologies, physical and cyber security processes, or products with our existing businesses and products;•liabilities inherited from the acquired companies' prior business operations;•diversion of management time and attention from our core business to the acquired business;•failure to retain key technical, management, sales and other personnel of the acquired business;•difficulty in retaining relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired business; and•difficulty in obtaining required regulatory approvals.In addition, the businesses and other assets we acquire may not achieve the sales and profitability expected. The occurrence of one or more of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these or any other significant risks encountered.We may not be able to increase or sustain our recent growth rate, and we may not be able to manage our future growth effectively.We may be unable to continue to expand our business or manage future growth. To successfully manage our growth and handle the responsibilities of being a public company, we must effectively:•hire, train, integrate and manage additional qualified engineers for engineering design and construction activities, new business personnel, and financial and information technology personnel;•retain key management, augment our management team, and retain qualified and certified water and wastewater system operators;•implement and improve additional and existing administrative, financial and operations systems, procedures and controls;•expand our technological capabilities; and•manage multiple relationships with our customers, regulators, suppliers and other third parties.If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities, satisfy customer requirements, execute our business plan or respond to competitive pressures.We have a number of large-volume commercial and industrial customers and a significant decrease in consumption by one or more of these customers could have an adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows.Our billed revenues and cash flows from operations will decrease if a significant business or industrial customer terminates or materially reduces its use of our water. Approximately $161.1 million, or 24.2%, of our 2019 water utility revenues was derived from business and industrial customers. However, if any of our large business or industrial customers in California reduce or cease its consumption of our water, the impact to net operating income would be minimal to our operations due to the WRAM and MCBA, but could impact our cash flows. In Hawaii, we serve a number of large resorts which if their water usage was reduced or ceased could have a material impact to our Hawaii operation. The delay between such date and the effective date of the rate relief may be significant and could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.29Table of ContentsOur operating cost and costs of providing services may rise faster than our revenues.Our ability to increase rates over time is dependent upon approval of such rate increases by the Commissions, or in the case of the City of Hawthorne and the City of Commerce, the City Council, which may be inclined, for political or other reasons, to limit rate increases. However, our costs, which are subject to market conditions and other factors, may increase significantly. The second largest component of our operating costs after water production is made up of salaries and wages. These costs are affected by the local supply and demand for qualified labor. Other large components of our costs are general insurance, workers compensation insurance, employee benefits and health insurance costs. These costs may increase disproportionately to rate increases authorized by the Commissions and may have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.Demand for our stock may fluctuate due to circumstances beyond our control.We believe that stockholders invest in public utility stocks, in part, because they seek reliable dividend payments. If there is an over-supply of stock of public utilities in the market relative to demand by such investors, the trading price of our securities could decrease. Additionally, if interest rates rise above the dividend yield offered by our equity securities, demand for our stock, and consequently its market price, may also decrease. A decline in demand for our stock may have a negative impact on our ability to finance capital projects.Adverse investment returns and other factors may increase our pension liability and pension funding requirements.A substantial number of our employees are covered by a defined benefit pension plan. At present, the pension plan is underfunded because our projected pension benefit obligation exceeds the aggregate fair value of plan assets. Under applicable law, we are required to make cash contributions to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding levels imposed by regulatory requirements. The amount of such required cash contribution is based on an actuarial valuation of the plan. The funded status of the plan can be affected by investment returns on plan assets, discount rates, mortality rates of plan participants, pension reform legislation and a number of other factors. There can be no assurance that the value of our pension plan assets will be sufficient to cover future liabilities. Although we have made contributions to our pension plan in recent years, it is possible that we could incur a pension liability adjustment, or could be required to make additional cash contributions to our pension plan, which would reduce the cash available for business and other needs.Labor relations matters could adversely affect our operating results.At December 31, 2019, 768 of our 1,207 total employees were union employees. Most of our unionized employees are represented by the Utility Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO, except certain engineering and laboratory employees who are represented by the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, AFL-CIO.We believe our labor relations are good, but in light of rising costs for health care and pensions, contract negotiations in the future may be difficult. Furthermore, changes in applicable law or regulations could have an adverse effect on management's negotiating position with respect to our currently unionized employees and/or employees that decide to unionize in the future. We are subject to a risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters as we negotiate with the unions to address these issues, which could affect our results of operations and financial condition. We can give no assurance that issues with our labor forces will be resolved favorably to us in the future or that we will not experience work stoppages.We depend significantly on the services of the members of our management team, and the departure of any of those persons could cause our operating results to suffer.Our success depends significantly on the continued individual and collective contributions of our management team. The loss of the services of any member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business as our management team has knowledge of our industry and customers and would be difficult to replace.Our operations are geographically concentrated in California and this lack of diversification may negatively impact our operations.Although we own facilities in a number of states, over 93.8% of our operations are located in California. As a result, we are largely subject to weather, political, water supply, labor, energy cost, regulatory and economic risks affecting California.We are also affected by the real property market in California. In order to grow our business, we may need to acquire additional real estate or rights to use real property owned by third parties, the cost of which tends to be higher and more volatile in California than in other states. The value of our assets in California may decline if there is a decline in the California real estate market which results in a significant decrease in real property values.30Table of ContentsWe retain certain risks not covered by our insurance policies.We evaluate our risks and insurance coverage annually or more frequently if circumstances dictate. Our evaluation considers the costs, risks and benefits of retaining versus insuring various risks as well as the availability of certain types of insurance coverage. Furthermore, we are also affected by increases in prices for insurance coverage; in particular, we have been, and will continue to be, affected by rising health insurance costs. Retained risks are associated with deductible limits, partial self-insurance programs and insurance policy coverage ceilings. If we suffer an uninsured loss, we may be unable to pass all, or any portion, of the loss on to customers because our rates are regulated by regulatory commissions. Consequently, uninsured losses may negatively affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will not face uninsured losses pertaining to the risks we have retained.Our enterprise risk management processes may not be effective in identifying and mitigating the risks to which we are subject, or in reducing the potential for losses in connection with such risks.Our enterprise risk management processes are designed to minimize or mitigate the risks to which we are subject, as well as any losses stemming from such risks. Although we seek to identify, measure, monitor, report, and control our exposure to such risks, and employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques in the process, those techniques are inherently limited in their ability to anticipate the existence or development of risks that are currently unknown and unanticipated. The ineffectiveness of our enterprise risk management processes in mitigating the impact of known risks or the emergence of previously unknown or unanticipated risks may result in our incurring losses in the future that could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.The accuracy of our judgments and estimates about financial and accounting matters will impact our operating results and financial condition.We make certain estimates and judgments in preparing our financial statements regarding, among others:•the useful life of intangible rights;•the number of years to depreciate certain assets;•amounts to set aside for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory obsolescence and uninsured losses;•our legal exposure and the appropriate accrual for claims, including medical claims and workers' compensation claims;•future costs and assumptions for pensions and other postretirement benefits;•regulatory recovery of regulatory assets;•possible tax uncertainties; and•projected collections of WRAM and MCBA receivables.The quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments will have an impact on our operating results and financial condition.In addition, we must estimate unbilled revenues and costs as of the end of each accounting period. If our estimates are not accurate, we will be required to make an adjustment in a future period. Accounting rules permit us to use expense balancing accounts and memorandum accounts that include cost changes to us that are different from amounts incorporated into the rates approved by the Commissions. These accounts result in expenses and revenues being recognized in periods other than in which they occurred.Municipalities, water districts and other public agencies may condemn our property by eminent domain action.State statutes allow municipalities, water districts and other public agencies to own and operate water systems.  These agencies are empowered to condemn water systems or real property owned by privately owned public utilities in certain circumstances and in compliance with California and federal law.  Additionally, whenever a public agency constructs facilities to extend its utility system into the service area of a privately owned public utility, such an act may constitute the taking of property and require reimbursement to the public utility for its loss.  If a public agency were to file an eminent domain lawsuit against us, we would incur substantial attorney’s fees, consultant and expert fees and other costs in considering a challenge to the right to take our utility property and/or its valuation for just compensation, as well as such fees and costs in any subsequent litigation if necessary. If the public agency prevailed and acquired our utility property, we would be entitled to just compensation for our loss, but we would no longer have access to the condemned property or water system. Neither would we be entitled to any portion of revenue generated from the use of such asset going forward.31Table of Contents"
12,CWT,CALIFORNIA WATER SERVICE GP,2019-02-28,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
.If any of the following risks actually occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Risks Related to Our Regulatory EnvironmentOur business is heavily regulated by state and federal regulatory agencies and our financial viability depends upon our ability to recover costs from our customers through rates that must be approved by state public utility commissions.California Water Service Company, New Mexico Water Service Company, Washington Water Service Company and Hawaii Water Service Company, Inc., are regulated public utilities which provide water and water-related service to our customers. The rates that we charge our water customers are subject to the jurisdiction of the regulatory commissions in the states in which we operate. These Commissions may set water and water-related rates for each operating district independently because the systems are not interconnected. The Commissions authorize us to charge rates that they consider to be sufficient to recover normal operating expenses, to provide funds for adding new or replacing water infrastructure, and to allow us to earn what the Commissions consider to be a fair and reasonable return on invested capital.18Table of ContentsOur revenues and consequently our ability to meet our financial objectives are dependent upon the rates we are authorized to charge our customers by the Commissions and our ability to recover our costs in these rates. Our management uses forecasts, models and estimates in order to set rates that will provide a fair and reasonable return on our invested capital. While our rates must be approved by the Commissions, no assurance can be given that our forecasts, models and estimates will be correct or that the Commissions will agree with our forecasts, models and estimates. If our rates are set too low, our revenues may be insufficient to cover our operating expenses, capital expenditure requirements and desired dividend levels.We periodically file rate increase applications with the Commissions. The ensuing administrative and hearing process may be lengthy and costly. The decisions of the Commissions are beyond our control and we can provide no assurances that our rate increase requests will be granted by the Commissions. Even if approved, there is no guarantee that approval will be given in a timely manner or at a sufficient level to cover our expenses and provide a reasonable return on our investment. If the rate increase decisions are delayed, our earnings may be adversely affected.Our evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets is subject to adjustment by regulatory agencies and any such adjustment could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Regulatory decisions may also impact prospective revenues and earnings, affect the timing of the recognition of revenues and expenses and may overturn past decisions used in determining our revenues and expenses. Our management continually evaluates the anticipated recovery of regulatory assets and revenues subject to refund and provides for allowances and/or reserves as deemed necessary. Current accounting procedures allow us to defer certain costs if we believe it is probable that we will be allowed to recover those costs through future rate increases. If the Commissions determined that a portion of our assets were not recoverable in customer rates, we may suffer an asset impairment which would require a write down in such asset's valuation which would be recorded through operations.If our assessment as to the probability of recovery through the ratemaking process is incorrect, the associated regulatory asset would be adjusted to reflect the change in our assessment or any regulatory disallowances. A change in our evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets or a regulatory disallowance of all or a portion of our cost could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.Regulatory agencies may disagree with our valuation and characterization of certain of our assets.If we determine that assets are no longer used or useful for utility operations, we may remove them from our rate base and subsequently sell those assets with any gain on sales accruing to the stockholders, subject to certain conditions. If the Commissions disagree with our characterization, there is a risk that the Commissions could determine that realized appreciation in property value should be awarded to customers rather than our stockholders.Changes in laws, rules and policies of regulatory agencies can significantly affect our business.Regulatory agencies may change their rules and policies for various reasons, including changes in the local political environment. Regulators are elected by popular vote or are appointed by elected officials, and the results of elections may change the long-established rules and policies of an agency dramatically. For example, in 2001 regulation regarding recovery of increases in electrical rates changed in California. For over 20 years prior to 2001, the CPUC allowed recovery of electric rate increases under its operating rules. However, in 2003, the CPUC reinstated its policy to allow utilities to adjust their rates for rate changes by the power companies. The original decision by the CPUC to change its policy, as well as its subsequent decision to reinstate that policy, affected our business.We rely on policies and regulations promulgated by the various state commissions in order to recover capital expenditures, maintain favorable treatment on gains from the sale of real property, offset certain production and operating costs, recover the cost of debt, maintain an optimal equity structure without over-leveraging, and have financial and operational flexibility to engage in non-regulated operations. If any of the Commissions with jurisdiction over us implements policies and regulations that do not allow us to accomplish some or all of the items listed above, our future operating results may be adversely affected.In addition, legislatures may repeal, relax or tighten existing laws, or enact new laws that impact the regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over our business or affect our business directly. If changes in existing laws or the implementation of new laws limit our ability to accomplish some of our business objectives, our future operating results may be adversely affected.We expect environmental health and safety regulation to increase, resulting in higher operating costs in the future.Our water and wastewater services are governed by various federal and state environmental protection, health and safety laws and regulations. These provisions establish criteria for drinking water and for discharges of water, wastewater and airborne substances. The EPA, state water quality regulators, and other state regulatory authorities promulgate numerous nationally and locally applicable standards, including maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for drinking water. We believe we are currently in compliance with all of the MCLs promulgated to date. Although we have a rigorous water quality assurance program in place, we 19Table of Contentscannot guarantee that we will continue to comply with all standards. If we violate any federal or state regulations or laws governing health and safety, we could be subject to substantial fines or otherwise sanctioned.Environmental health and safety laws are complex and change frequently. They tend to become more stringent over time. As new or stricter standards are introduced, they could increase our operating costs. Although we would likely seek permission to recover these costs through rate increases, we can give no assurance that the Commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs.We are required to test our water quality for certain chemicals and potential contaminants on a regular basis. If the test results indicate that our water exceeds allowable limits, we may be required either to commence treatment to remove the contaminant or to develop an alternate water source. Either of these results may be costly. Although we would likely seek permission to recover these through rate increases, there can be no assurance that the Commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs.New and/or more stringent water quality regulations could increase our operating costs.We are subject to water quality standards set by federal, state and local authorities that have the power to issue new regulations. Compliance with new regulations that are more stringent than current regulations could increase our operating costs.On July 1, 2014, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) changed the water quality standard for chromium-6 in our water supply. The new standard requires us to have 10 parts per billion or less of chromium-6 in our California water supply. The CPUC authorized a memorandum account in 2014 to track all costs associated with compliance with the new chromium-6 standard. Although we would likely seek permission to recover additional costs of compliance through rate increases, we can give no assurance that the CPUC would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs.Legislation and regulation designed to mitigate or adapt to climate change may impact our operations.Future legislation or regulation regarding climate change may restrict our operations or impose new costs on our business. Our operations depend on power provided by other public utilities and, in emergencies, power generated by our portable and fixed generators. If future legislation or regulation limits emissions from the power generation process, our cost of power may increase. Any increase in the cost of power will be passed along to our California customers through the MCBA or included in our cost of service paid by our customers as requested in our GRC filings in California.Starting January 1, 2010, under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), all capital projects of a certain type (primarily wells, tanks, major pipelines and treatment facilities) require mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. The cost to prepare the CEQA documentation and permit will add an estimated ten thousand dollars to such capital projects. This cost will be included in our capital cost and added to our rate base, which will be requested to be paid for by our customers. Any increase in the operating cost of the facilities will also be included in our cost of service paid by our customers as requested in our GRC filings. Although we would likely seek permission to recover these costs through rate increases, we can give no assurance that the CPUC would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs. Cap and trade regulations were implemented in California in 2012 with the goal of reducing emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020. Although we would likely seek permission to recover these costs through rate increases, we can give no assurance that the CPUC would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs. We have been party to a toxic contamination lawsuit which could result in us paying damages not covered by insurance.We have been and may be in the future, party to water contamination lawsuits, which may not be fully covered by insurance.The number of environmental and product-related lawsuits against other water utilities have increased in frequency in recent years. If we are subject to additional environmental or product-related lawsuits, we might incur significant legal costs and it is uncertain whether we would be able to recover the legal costs from customers or other third parties. In addition, if current California law regarding CPUC's preemptive jurisdiction over regulated public utilities for claims about compliance with California Department of Health Services and United States EPA water quality standards changes, our legal exposure may be significantly increased.Risks Related to Our Business OperationsWastewater operations entail significant risks.While wastewater collection and treatment is not presently a major component of our revenues, wastewater collection and treatment involve many risks associated with damage to the surrounding environment. If collection or treatment systems fail or do not operate properly, untreated or partially treated wastewater could discharge onto property or into nearby streams and rivers, 20Table of Contentscausing property damage or injury to aquatic life, or even human life. Liabilities resulting from such damage could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Demand for our water is subject to various factors and is affected by seasonal fluctuations.Demand for our water during the warmer, dry months is generally greater than during cooler or rainy months due primarily to additional requirements for water in connection with irrigation systems, swimming pools, cooling systems and other outside water use. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically warmer months, demand will vary with temperature and rainfall levels. If temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal, or if there is more rainfall than normal, the demand for our water may decrease. Under the WRAM mechanism, lower water usage in our California operations impacts our cash flows in the year of usage, but results in higher cash flows in the following years.In addition, governmental restrictions on water usage during drought conditions may result in a decreased demand for our water, even if our water reserves are sufficient to serve our customers during these drought conditions. The Commissions may not allow surcharges to collect lost revenues caused by customers' conservation during a drought. Regardless of whether we may surcharge our customers during a conservation period, they may use less water even after a drought has passed because of conservation patterns developed during the drought. Furthermore, our customers may wish to use recycled water as a substitute for potable water. If rights are granted to others to serve our customers recycled water, there will likely be a decrease in demand for our water.Finally, changes in prevailing weather patterns due to climate change may affect customer demand. If increased ambient temperatures affect our service areas, water used for irrigation and cooling may increase. If rainfall patterns change, our customers may change their patterns of water use including the amount of outdoor irrigation and the type of landscape they install. Government agencies may also mandate changes to customer irrigation or landscape patterns in response to changes in weather and climate.The adequacy of our water supplies depends upon a variety of factors beyond our control. Interruption in the water supply may adversely affect our earnings.We depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and future needs of our customers. Whether we have an adequate supply varies depending upon a variety of factors, many of which are partially or completely beyond our control, including:•the amount of rainfall;•the amount of water stored in reservoirs;•underground water supply from which well water is pumped;•availability from water wholesalers;•changes in the amount of water used by our customers;•water quality and availability of appropriate treatment technology;•legal limitations on water use such as rationing restrictions during a drought;•changes in prevailing weather patterns and climate; and•population growth.We purchase our water supply from various governmental agencies and others. Water supply availability may be affected by weather conditions, funding and other political and environmental considerations. In addition, our ability to use surface water is subject to regulations regarding water quality and volume limitations. If new regulations are imposed or existing regulations are changed or given new interpretations, the availability of surface water may be materially reduced. A reduction in surface water could result in the need to procure more costly water from other sources, thereby increasing our water production costs and adversely affecting our operating results if not recovered in rates on a timely basis.There is strong scientific consensus that human activity including carbon emissions is changing the chemical and thermodynamic characteristics of the atmosphere and the earth's overall climate. Because scientific efforts have been global in nature, and because climate modeling has not yet been predictive on a local scale, there is tremendous uncertainty over the timing, extent, and types of impacts global climate change may have in our service areas. In addition, studies of tree ring data show long periods of drought conditions have occurred in the historical record in California but prior to our operation. Thus, we include potential climate change risks in our water supply planning activities. We also periodically review the climate change plans of our wholesalers to determine whether alternative supplies may be necessary in the future. However, we can give no assurance that replacement water supplies will be available at a reasonable cost or a cost acceptable to our customers and Commissions.21Table of ContentsWe have entered into long-term water supply agreements, which commit us to making certain minimum payments whether or not we purchase any water. Therefore, if demand is insufficient to use our required purchases we would have to pay for water we did not receive.From time to time, we enter into water supply agreements with third parties and our business is dependent upon such agreements in order to meet regional demand. For example, we have entered into a water supply contract with the SFPUC that expires on June 30, 2034. We can give no assurance that the SFPUC, or any of the other parties from whom we purchase water, will renew our contracts upon expiration, or that we will not be subject to significant price increases under any such renewed contracts.The parties from whom we purchase water maintain significant infrastructure and systems to deliver water to us. Maintenance of these facilities is beyond our control. If these facilities are not adequately maintained or if these parties otherwise default on their obligations to supply water to us, we may not have adequate water supplies to meet our customers' needs.If we are unable to access adequate water supplies we may be unable to satisfy all customer demand, which could result in rationing. Rationing may have an adverse effect on cash flow from operations. We can make no guarantee that we will always have access to an adequate supply of water that will meet all required quality standards. Water shortages may affect us in a variety of ways. For example, shortages could:•adversely affect our supply mix by causing us to rely on more expensive purchased water;•adversely affect operating costs;•increase the risk of contamination to our systems due to our inability to maintain sufficient pressure; and•increase capital expenditures for building pipelines to connect to alternative sources of supply, new wells to replace those that are no longer in service or are otherwise inadequate to meet the needs of our customers and reservoirs and other facilities to conserve or reclaim water.We may or may not be able to recover increased operating and construction costs on a timely basis, or at all, for our regulated systems through the ratemaking process. Although we can give no assurance, we may be able to recover certain of these costs from third parties that may be responsible, or potentially responsible, for groundwater contamination.Changes in water supply costs impact our operations.The cost to obtain water for delivery to our customers varies depending on the sources of supply, wholesale suppliers' prices, the quality of water required to be treated and the quantity of water produced to fulfill customer water demand. Our source of supply varies among our operating districts. Certain districts obtain all of their supply from wells; some districts purchase all of the supply from wholesale suppliers; and other districts obtain the supply from a combination of wells and wholesale suppliers. A small portion of supply comes from surface sources and is processed through Company-owned water treatment plants. On average, slightly more than half of the water we deliver to our customers is pumped from wells or received from a surface supply with the remainder purchased from wholesale suppliers. Water purchased from suppliers usually costs us more than surface supplied or well pumped water. The cost of purchased water for delivery to customers represented 35.2% and 35.0% of our total operating costs in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Water purchased from suppliers will require renewal of our contracts upon expiration and may result in significant price increases under any such renewed contracts.Wholesale water suppliers may increase their prices for water delivered to us based on factors that affect their operating costs. Purchased water rate increases are beyond our control. In California, effective July 1, 2008, our ability to recover increases in the cost of purchased water changed with the adoption of the MCBA. With this change, actual purchased water costs are compared to authorized purchased water costs, with variances netted against the variances in purchased power, pump tax, and metered revenue, being recorded to revenue. The balance in the MCBA will be collected in the future by billing the net WRAM and MCBA accounts receivable balances over 12, 18, and 18+ month periods, which may have a short-term negative impact on cash flow.Dependency upon adequate supply of electricity and certain chemicals could adversely affect our results of operations.Purchased electrical power is required to operate the wells and pumps needed to supply water to our customers. Although there are back-up power generators to operate a number of wells and pumps in emergencies, an extended interruption in power could impact the ability to supply water. In the past, California has been subject to rolling power blackouts due to insufficient power supplies. There is no assurance we will not be subject to power blackouts in the future. Additionally, we require sufficient amounts of certain chemicals in order to treat the water we supply. There are multiple sources for these chemicals but an extended interruption of supply could adversely affect our ability to adequately treat our water.Purchased power is a significant operating expense. During 2018 and 2017, purchased power expense represented 5.3% and 5.1%, respectively, of our total operating costs. These costs are beyond our control and can change unpredictably and substantially 22Table of Contentsas occurred in California during 2001 when rates paid for electricity increased 48%. As with purchased water, purchased power costs are included in the MCBA. Cash flows between rate filings may be adversely affected until the Commission authorizes a rate change, but earnings will be minimally impacted. Cost of chemicals used in the delivery of water is not an element of the MCBA, and therefore, variances in quantity or cost could impact the results of operations.Our business requires significant capital expenditures to replace or improve aging infrastructure that are dependent on our ability to secure appropriate funding. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital or if the rates at which we borrow increase, there would be a negative impact on our results of operations.The water utility business is capital-intensive. We invest significant funds to replace or improve aging infrastructure such as property, plant and equipment. In addition, water shortages may adversely affect us by causing us to rely on more purchased water. This could cause increases in capital expenditures needed to build pipelines to secure alternative water sources. In addition, we require capital to grow our business through acquisitions. We fund our short-term capital requirements from cash received from operations and funds received from developers. We also borrow funds from banks under short-term bank lending arrangements. We seek to meet our long-term capital needs by raising equity through common or preferred stock issues or issuing debt obligations. We cannot give any assurance that these sources will continue to be adequate or that the cost of funds will remain at levels permitting us to earn a reasonable rate of return. In the event we are unable to obtain sufficient capital, our expansion efforts could be curtailed, which may affect our growth and may affect our future results of operations.Our ability to access the capital markets is affected by the ratings of certain of our debt securities. Standard & Poor's Rating Agency issues a rating on California Water Service Company's ability to repay certain debt obligations. The credit rating agency could downgrade our credit rating based on reviews of our financial performance and projections or upon the occurrence of other events that could impact our business outlook. Lower ratings by the agency could restrict our ability to access equity and debt capital. We can give no assurance that the rating agency will maintain ratings which allow us to borrow under advantageous conditions and at reasonable interest rates. A future downgrade by the agency could also increase our cost of capital by causing potential investors to require a higher interest rate due to a perceived risk related to our ability to repay outstanding debt obligations.While the majority of our debt is long term at fixed rates, we do have interest rate exposure in our short-term borrowings which have variable interest rates. We are also subject to interest rate risks on new financings. However, if interest rates were to increase on a long-term basis, our management believes that customer rates would increase accordingly, subject to approval by the appropriate commission. We can give no assurance that the Commission would approve such an increase in customer rates.We are obligated to comply with specified debt covenants under certain of our loan and debt agreements. Failure to maintain compliance with these covenants could limit future borrowing, and we could face increased borrowing costs, litigation, acceleration of maturity schedules, and cross default issues. Such actions by our creditors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Our inability to access the capital or financial markets could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to meet long-term commitments. Changes in economic conditions in our markets could affect our customers' ability to pay for water services. Any of these could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.We rely on our current credit facilities to fund short-term liquidity needs if internal funds are not available from operations. Specifically, given the seasonal fluctuations in demand for our water we commonly draw on our credit facilities to meet our cash requirements at times in the year when demand is relatively low. We also may occasionally use letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facilities. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to draw on our credit facilities. Our access to funds under our credit facilities is dependent on the ability of our banks to meet their funding commitments.Many of our customers and suppliers also have exposure to risks that could affect their ability to meet payment and supply commitments. We operate in geographic areas that may be particularly susceptible to declines in the price of real property, which could result in significant declines in demand for our products and services. In the event that any of our significant customers or suppliers, or a significant number of smaller customers and suppliers, are adversely affected by these risks, we may face disruptions in supply, significant reductions in demand for our products and services, inability of customers to pay invoices when due, and other adverse effects that could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.Our operations and certain contracts for water distribution and treatment depend on the financial capability of state and local governments, and other municipal entities such as water districts. Major disruptions in the financial strength or operations of such entities, such as liquidity limitations, bankruptcy or insolvency, could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business and/or enforce our rights under contracts to which such entities are a party.23Table of ContentsWe are a holding company that depends on cash flow from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock.As a holding company, we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries and our only significant assets are investments in those subsidiaries. 94.1% of our revenues are derived from the operations of California Water Service Company. As a result, we are dependent on cash flow from our subsidiaries, and California Water Service Company in particular, to meet our obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock.Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and generally have no obligation to pay any amounts due on California Water Service Group's debt or to provide California Water Service Group with funds for dividends. Although there are no contractual or regulatory restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us, the reasonableness of our capital structure is one of the factors considered by state and local regulatory agencies in their ratemaking determinations. Therefore, transfer of funds from our subsidiaries to us for the payment of our obligations or dividends may have an adverse effect on ratemaking determinations. Furthermore, our right to receive cash or other assets upon the liquidation or reorganization of a subsidiary is generally subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary. If we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries in a timely manner, we may be unable to meet our obligations or pay dividends.We can make dividend payments only from our surplus (the excess, if any, of our net assets over total paid-in capital) or if there is no surplus, the net profits for the current fiscal year or the fiscal year before which the dividend is declared. In addition, we can pay cash dividends only if after paying those dividends we would be able to pay our liabilities as they become due. Owners of our capital stock cannot force us to pay dividends and dividends will only be paid if and when declared by our board of directors. Our board of directors can elect at any time, and for an indefinite duration, not to declare dividends on our capital stock.An important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems. Risks associated with potential acquisitions, divestitures or restructurings may adversely affect us.We may seek to acquire or invest in other companies, technologies, services or products that complement our business. The execution of our growth strategy may expose us to different risks than those associated with our utility operations. We can give no assurance that we will succeed in finding attractive acquisition candidates or investments, or that we would be able to reach mutually agreeable terms with such parties. In addition, as consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water and wastewater industries, the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase to unacceptable levels and limit our ability to grow through acquisitions. If we are unable to find acquisition candidates or investments, our ability to grow may be limited.Acquisition and investment transactions may result in the issuance of our equity securities that could be dilutive if the acquisition or business opportunity does not develop in accordance with our business plan. They may also result in significant write-offs and an increase in our debt. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Any of these transactions could involve numerous additional risks, including one or more of the following:•problems integrating the acquired operations, personnel, technologies, physical and cyber security processes, or products with our existing businesses and products;•liabilities inherited from the acquired companies' prior business operations;•diversion of management time and attention from our core business to the acquired business;•failure to retain key technical, management, sales and other personnel of the acquired business;•difficulty in retaining relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired business; and•difficulty in obtaining required regulatory approvals.In addition, the businesses and other assets we acquire may not achieve the sales and profitability expected. The occurrence of one or more of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these or any other significant risks encountered.We may not be able to increase or sustain our recent growth rate, and we may not be able to manage our future growth effectively.We may be unable to continue to expand our business or manage future growth. To successfully manage our growth and handle the responsibilities of being a public company, we must effectively:•hire, train, integrate and manage additional qualified engineers for engineering design and construction activities, new business personnel, and financial and information technology personnel;24Table of Contents•retain key management, augment our management team, and retain qualified and certified water and wastewater system operators;•implement and improve additional and existing administrative, financial and operations systems, procedures and controls;•expand our technological capabilities; and•manage multiple relationships with our customers, regulators, suppliers and other third parties.If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities, satisfy customer requirements, execute our business plan or respond to competitive pressures.We have a number of large-volume commercial and industrial customers and a significant decrease in consumption by one or more of these customers could have an adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows.Our billed revenues and cash flows from operations will decrease if a significant business or industrial customer terminates or materially reduces its use of our water. Approximately $164.3 million, or 24.3%, of our 2018 water utility revenues was derived from business and industrial customers. However, if any of our large business or industrial customers in California reduce or cease its consumption of our water, the impact to net operating income would be minimal to our operations due to the WRAM and MCBA, but could impact our cash flows. In Hawaii, we serve a number of large resorts which if their water usage was reduced or ceased could have a material impact to our Hawaii operation. The delay between such date and the effective date of the rate relief may be significant and could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.Natural disasters, climate change, and other factors may change the population in our service areas.In the event that some outside factor such as a wildfire, flood, changed climate pattern, or change in the local economy reduces or eliminates our customer base in a service area, we could face unrecoverable costs. In those circumstances the remaining customers might not be able to pay for the operating costs or capital costs of the water system. The company may not be able to recover capital costs of property which is no longer used and useful in utility service. Although we would likely seek permission to recover these costs through rate increases on remaining customers or in statewide rates, we can give no assurance that the Commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these costs.Our operating cost and costs of providing services may rise faster than our revenues.Our ability to increase rates over time is dependent upon approval of such rate increases by the Commissions, or in the case of the City of Hawthorne and the City of Commerce, the City Council, which may be inclined, for political or other reasons, to limit rate increases. However, our costs, which are subject to market conditions and other factors, may increase significantly. The second largest component of our operating costs after water production is made up of salaries and wages. These costs are affected by the local supply and demand for qualified labor. Other large components of our costs are general insurance, workers compensation insurance, employee benefits and health insurance costs. These costs may increase disproportionately to rate increases authorized by the Commissions and may have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.Demand for our stock may fluctuate due to circumstances beyond our control.We believe that stockholders invest in public utility stocks, in part, because they seek reliable dividend payments. If there is an over-supply of stock of public utilities in the market relative to demand by such investors, the trading price of our securities could decrease. Additionally, if interest rates rise above the dividend yield offered by our equity securities, demand for our stock, and consequently its market price, may also decrease. A decline in demand for our stock may have a negative impact on our ability to finance capital projects.Adverse investment returns and other factors may increase our pension liability and pension funding requirements.A substantial number of our employees are covered by a defined benefit pension plan. At present, the pension plan is underfunded because our projected pension benefit obligation exceeds the aggregate fair value of plan assets. Under applicable law, we are required to make cash contributions to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding levels imposed by regulatory requirements. The amount of such required cash contribution is based on an actuarial valuation of the plan. The funded status of the plan can be affected by investment returns on plan assets, discount rates, mortality rates of plan participants, pension reform legislation and a number of other factors. There can be no assurance that the value of our pension plan assets will be sufficient to cover future liabilities. Although we have made contributions to our pension plan in recent years, it is possible that we could incur a pension liability adjustment, or could be required to make additional cash contributions to our pension plan, which would reduce the cash available for business and other needs.25Table of ContentsLabor relations matters could adversely affect our operating results.At December 31, 2018, 751 of our 1,184 total employees were union employees. Most of our unionized employees are represented by the Utility Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO, except certain engineering and laboratory employees who are represented by the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, AFL-CIO.We believe our labor relations are good, but in light of rising costs for health care and pensions, contract negotiations in the future may be difficult. Furthermore, changes in applicable law or regulations could have an adverse effect on management's negotiating position with respect to our currently unionized employees and/or employees that decide to unionize in the future. We are subject to a risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters as we negotiate with the unions to address these issues, which could affect our results of operations and financial condition. We can give no assurance that issues with our labor forces will be resolved favorably to us in the future or that we will not experience work stoppages.We depend significantly on the services of the members of our management team, and the departure of any of those persons could cause our operating results to suffer.Our success depends significantly on the continued individual and collective contributions of our management team. The loss of the services of any member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business as our management team has knowledge of our industry and customers and would be difficult to replace.Our operations are geographically concentrated in California and this lack of diversification may negatively impact our operations.Although we own facilities in a number of states, over 94.1% of our operations are located in California. As a result, we are largely subject to weather, political, water supply, labor, energy cost, regulatory and economic risks affecting California.We are also affected by the real property market in California. In order to grow our business, we may need to acquire additional real estate or rights to use real property owned by third parties, the cost of which tends to be higher and more volatile in California than in other states. The value of our assets in California may decline if there is a decline in the California real estate market which results in a significant decrease in real property values.The effects of natural disasters, attacks by third parties, pandemics, or poor water quality or contamination to our water supply may result in disruption in our services and litigation which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.We operate in areas that are prone to earthquakes, fires, mudslides and other natural disasters. A significant seismic event or other natural disaster in California where our operations are concentrated could adversely impact our ability to deliver water and adversely affect our costs of operations. A major disaster could damage or destroy substantial capital assets. The CPUC has historically allowed utilities to establish a catastrophic event memorandum account as another possible mechanism to recover costs. However, we can give no assurance that the CPUC or any other commission would allow any such cost recovery mechanism in the future.Our water supplies are subject to contamination, including contamination from the development of naturally-occurring compounds, chemicals in groundwater systems, pollution resulting from man-made sources, such as MTBE, sea water incursion and possible third-party attacks, including physical attacks, terrorist attacks, and cyber attacks. If our water supply is contaminated, we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water source. In addition, we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities, or development of new treatment methods. If we are unable to substitute water supply from an uncontaminated water source, or to adequately treat the contaminated water source in a cost-effective manner, there may be an adverse effect on our revenues, operating results and financial condition. The costs we incur to decontaminate a water source or an underground water system could be significant and may not be recoverable in rates. We could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances in our water supplies or other environmental damage. For example, private plaintiffs have the right to bring personal injury or other toxic tort claims arising from the presence of hazardous substances in our drinking water supplies. Our insurance policies may not be sufficient to cover the costs of these claims.We operate a dam. If the dam were to fail for any reason, we would lose a water supply and flooding likely would occur. Whether or not we were responsible for the dam's failure, we could be sued. We can give no assurance that we would be able to successfully defend such a suit.In light of the threats to the nation's health and security ensuing in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, we have taken steps to increase security measures at our facilities and heighten employee awareness of threats to our water supply, to protect against third-party attacks, including physical attacks, terrorist attacks and cyber attacks. We have also tightened our security measures regarding the delivery and handling of certain chemicals used in our business. We have and will continue to 26Table of Contentsbear increased costs for security precautions to protect our facilities, operations and supplies. These costs may be significant. Despite these tightened security measures, we may not be in a position to control the outcome of third-party attacks should they occur.We depend upon our skilled and trained workforce to ensure water delivery. Were a pandemic to occur, we can give no assurance that we would be able to maintain sufficient human resources to ensure uninterrupted service in all of the districts that we serve.If any of these catastrophic events were to occur, we can give no assurance that our emergency preparedness plans would be adequate and that we would respond effectively, which could result in public or employee harm.We retain certain risks not covered by our insurance policies.We evaluate our risks and insurance coverage annually or more frequently if circumstances dictate. Our evaluation considers the costs, risks and benefits of retaining versus insuring various risks as well as the availability of certain types of insurance coverage. Furthermore, we are also affected by increases in prices for insurance coverage; in particular, we have been, and will continue to be, affected by rising health insurance costs. Retained risks are associated with deductible limits, partial self-insurance programs and insurance policy coverage ceilings. If we suffer an uninsured loss, we may be unable to pass all, or any portion, of the loss on to customers because our rates are regulated by regulatory commissions. Consequently, uninsured losses may negatively affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will not face uninsured losses pertaining to the risks we have retained.We may be at risk for litigation under the principle of inverse condemnation for activities in the normal course of business which have a damaging effect on private propertyThe California constitution allows compensation for a public utility taking or damaging private property, even when damage occurs through no fault of the utility and regardless of whether the damage could be foreseen. This is known as the doctrine of inverse condemnation. Based on recent legal activity in this area, Cal Water could be sued under inverse condemnation if its facilities or operations damage private property. A court finding of inverse condemnation does not obligate the CPUC to allow Cal Water to recover damage awards from customers. We rely on our information technology (""IT"") and a number of complex business systems to assist with the management of our business and customer and supplier relationships, and a disruption of these systems could adversely affect our business.Our IT systems are an integral part of our business, and a serious disruption of our IT systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently, which, in turn, could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and adversely affect our results of operations. We depend on our IT systems to bill customers, process orders, provide customer service, manage construction projects, manage our financial records, track assets, remotely monitor certain of our plants and facilities and manage human resources, inventory and accounts receivable collections. Our IT systems also enable us to purchase products from our suppliers and bill customers on a timely basis, maintain cost-effective operations and provide service to our customers. Some of our mission and business critical IT systems are older, such as our SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system. Although we do not believe that our IT systems are at a materially greater risk of cyber security incidents than other similar organizations, our IT systems remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from:•power loss, computer systems failures, and internet, telecommunications or data network failures;•operator negligence or improper operation by, or supervision of, employees;•physical and electronic loss of customer data due to security breaches, cyber attacks, misappropriation and similar events;•computer viruses;•intentional security breaches, hacking, denial of services actions, misappropriation of data and similar events; and•earthquakes, floods, fires, mudslides and other natural disasters or physical attacks.These events may result in physical and/or electronic loss of customer or financial data, security breaches, misappropriation and other adverse consequences. In addition, the lack of redundancy for certain of our IT systems, including billing systems, could exacerbate the impact of any of these events on us.In addition, we may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our business, and we might lack sufficient resources to make the necessary upgrades or replacements of our outdated existing technology to allow us to continue to operate at our current level of efficiency.27Table of ContentsOur enterprise risk management processes may not be effective in identifying and mitigating the risks to which we are subject, or in reducing the potential for losses in connection with such risks.Our enterprise risk management processes are designed to minimize or mitigate the risks to which we are subject, as well as any losses stemming from such risks. Although we seek to identify, measure, monitor, report, and control our exposure to such risks, and employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques in the process, those techniques are inherently limited in their ability to anticipate the existence or development of risks that are currently unknown and unanticipated. The ineffectiveness of our enterprise risk management processes in mitigating the impact of known risks or the emergence of previously unknown or unanticipated risks may result in our incurring losses in the future that could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.The accuracy of our judgments and estimates about financial and accounting matters will impact our operating results and financial condition.We make certain estimates and judgments in preparing our financial statements regarding, among others:•the useful life of intangible rights;•the number of years to depreciate certain assets;•amounts to set aside for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory obsolescence and uninsured losses;•our legal exposure and the appropriate accrual for claims, including medical claims and workers' compensation claims;•future costs and assumptions for pensions and other postretirement benefits;•regulatory recovery of regulatory assets;•possible tax uncertainties; and•projected collections of WRAM and MCBA receivables.The quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments will have an impact on our operating results and financial condition.In addition, we must estimate unbilled revenues and costs as of the end of each accounting period. If our estimates are not accurate, we will be required to make an adjustment in a future period. Accounting rules permit us to use expense balancing accounts and memorandum accounts that include cost changes to us that are different from amounts incorporated into the rates approved by the Commissions. These accounts result in expenses and revenues being recognized in periods other than in which they occurred.Municipalities, water districts and other public agencies may condemn our property by eminent domain action.State statutes allow municipalities, water districts and other public agencies to own and operate water systems.  These agencies are empowered to condemn water systems or real property owned by privately owned public utilities in certain circumstances and in compliance with California and federal law.  Additionally, whenever a public agency constructs facilities to extend its utility system into the service area of a privately owned public utility, such an act may constitute the taking of property and require reimbursement to the public utility for its loss.  If a public agency were to file an eminent domain lawsuit against us, we would incur substantial attorney’s fees, consultant and expert fees and other costs in considering a challenge to the right to take our utility property and/or its valuation for just compensation, as well as such fees and costs in any subsequent litigation if necessary. If the public agency prevailed and acquired our utility property, we would be entitled to just compensation for our loss, but we would no longer have access to the condemned property or water system.  Neither would we be entitled to any portion of revenue generated from the use of such asset going forward"
2,CWT,CALIFORNIA WATER SERVICE GP,2018-03-01,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
.If any of the following risks actually occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Risks Related to Our Regulatory EnvironmentOur business is heavily regulated by state and federal regulatory agencies and our financial viability depends upon our ability to recover costs from our customers through rates that must be approved by state public utility commissions.California Water Service Company, New Mexico Water Service Company, Washington Water Service Company and Hawaii Water Service Company, Inc., are regulated public utilities which provide water and water-related service to our customers. The rates that we charge our water customers are subject to the jurisdiction of the regulatory commissions in the states in which we operate. These Commissions may set water and water-related rates for each operating district independently because the systems are not interconnected. The Commissions authorize us to charge rates that they consider to be sufficient to recover normal operating 17Table of Contentsexpenses, to provide funds for adding new or replacing water infrastructure, and to allow us to earn what the Commissions consider to be a fair and reasonable return on invested capital.Our revenues and consequently our ability to meet our financial objectives are dependent upon the rates we are authorized to charge our customers by the Commissions and our ability to recover our costs in these rates. Our management uses forecasts, models and estimates in order to set rates that will provide a fair and reasonable return on our invested capital. While our rates must be approved by the Commissions, no assurance can be given that our forecasts, models and estimates will be correct or that the Commissions will agree with our forecasts, models and estimates. If our rates are set too low, our revenues may be insufficient to cover our operating expenses, capital expenditure requirements and desired dividend levels.We periodically file rate increase applications with the Commissions. The ensuing administrative and hearing process may be lengthy and costly. The decisions of the Commissions are beyond our control and we can provide no assurances that our rate increase requests will be granted by the Commissions. Even if approved, there is no guarantee that approval will be given in a timely manner or at a sufficient level to cover our expenses and provide a reasonable return on our investment. If the rate increase decisions are delayed, our earnings may be adversely affected.Our evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets is subject to adjustment by regulatory agencies and any such adjustment could adversely affect our results of operations.Regulatory decisions may also impact prospective revenues and earnings, affect the timing of the recognition of revenues and expenses and may overturn past decisions used in determining our revenues and expenses. Our management continually evaluates the anticipated recovery of regulatory assets and revenues subject to refund and provides for allowances and/or reserves as deemed necessary. Current accounting procedures allow us to defer certain costs if we believe it is probable that we will be allowed to recover those costs through future rate increases. If the Commissions determined that a portion of our assets were not recoverable in customer rates, we may suffer an asset impairment which would require a write down in such asset's valuation which would be recorded through operations.If our assessment as to the probability of recovery through the ratemaking process is incorrect, the associated regulatory asset would be adjusted to reflect the change in our assessment or any regulatory disallowances. A change in our evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets or a regulatory disallowance of all or a portion of our cost could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.Regulatory agencies may disagree with our valuation and characterization of certain of our assets.If we determine that assets are no longer used or useful for utility operations, we may remove them from our rate base and subsequently sell those assets. If the Commissions disagree with our characterization, we could be subjected to penalties. Furthermore, there is a risk that the Commissions could determine that realized appreciation in property value should be awarded to customers rather than our stockholders.Changes in laws, rules and policies of regulatory agencies can significantly affect our business.Regulatory agencies may change their rules and policies for various reasons, including changes in the local political environment. In some states, regulators are elected by popular vote or are appointed by elected officials, and the results of elections may change the long-established rules and policies of an agency dramatically. For example, in 2001 regulation regarding recovery of increases in electrical rates changed in California. For over 20 years prior to 2001, the CPUC allowed recovery of electric rate increases under its operating rules. However, in 2003, the CPUC reinstated its policy to allow utilities to adjust their rates for rate changes by the power companies. The original decision by the CPUC to change its policy, as well as its subsequent decision to reinstate that policy, affected our business.We rely on policies and regulations promulgated by the various state commissions in order to recover capital expenditures, maintain favorable treatment on gains from the sale of real property, offset certain production and operating costs, recover the cost of debt, maintain an optimal equity structure without over-leveraging, and have financial and operational flexibility to engage in non-regulated operations. If any of the Commissions with jurisdiction over us implements policies and regulations that do not allow us to accomplish some or all of the items listed above, our future operating results may be adversely affected.In addition, legislatures may repeal, relax or tighten existing laws, or enact new laws that impact the regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over our business or affect our business directly. If changes in existing laws or the implementation of new laws limit our ability to accomplish some of our business objectives, our future operating results may be adversely affected.We expect environmental health and safety regulation to increase, resulting in higher operating costs in the future.Our water and wastewater services are governed by various federal and state environmental protection, health and safety laws and regulations. These provisions establish criteria for drinking water and for discharges of water, wastewater and airborne 18Table of Contentssubstances. The EPA promulgates numerous nationally applicable standards, including maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for drinking water. We believe we are currently in compliance with all of the MCLs promulgated to date.  Although we have a rigorous water quality assurance program in place, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to comply with all standards. If we violate any federal or state regulations or laws governing health and safety, we could be subject to substantial fines or otherwise sanctioned.Environmental health and safety laws are complex and change frequently. They tend to become more stringent over time. As new or stricter standards are introduced, they could increase our operating costs. Although we would likely seek permission to recover these costs through rate increases, we can give no assurance that the Commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs.We are required to test our water quality for certain chemicals and potential contaminants on a regular basis. If the test results indicate that our water exceeds allowable limits, we may be required either to commence treatment to remove the contaminant or to develop an alternate water source. Either of these results may be costly. Although we would likely seek permission to recover these through rate increases, there can be no assurance that the Commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs.New and/or more stringent water quality regulations could increase our operating costs.We are subject to water quality standards set by federal, state and local authorities that have the power to issue new regulations. Compliance with new regulations that are more stringent than current regulations could increase our operating costs.On July 1, 2014, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) changed the water quality standard for chromium-6 in our water supply. The new standard requires us to have 10 parts per billion or less of chromium-6 in our California water supply. The CPUC authorized a memorandum account in 2014 to track all costs associated with compliance with the new chromium-6 standard. Although we would likely seek permission to recover additional costs of compliance through rate increases, we can give no assurance that the CPUC would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs.Legislation regarding climate change may impact our operations.Future legislation regarding climate change may restrict our operations or impose new costs on our business. Our operations depend on power provided by other public utilities and, in emergencies, power generated by our portable and fixed generators. If future legislation limits emissions from the power generation process, our cost of power may increase. Any increase in the cost of power will be passed along to our California customers through the MCBA or included in our cost of service paid by our customers as requested in our GRC filings. While recovery of these costs is not guaranteed, we would expect recovery in the regulatory process.Starting January 1, 2010, under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), all capital projects of a certain type (primarily wells, tanks, major pipelines and treatment facilities) will require mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. The cost to prepare the CEQA documentation and permit will add an estimated ten thousand dollars to such capital projects. This cost will be included in our capital cost and added to our rate base, which will be requested to be paid for by our customers. Any increase in the operating cost of the facilities will also be included in our cost of service paid by our customers as requested in our GRC filings. While recovery of these costs is not guaranteed, we would expect recovery in the regulatory process.Cap and trade regulations were implemented in 2012 with the goal of reducing emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020. While recovery of these costs is not guaranteed, we would expect recovery in the regulatory process.We are party to a toxic contamination lawsuit which could result in us paying damages not covered by insurance.We have been and may be in the future, party to water contamination lawsuits, which may not be fully covered by insurance.The number of environmental and product-related lawsuits against other water utilities have increased in frequency in recent years. If we are subject to additional environmental or product-related lawsuits, we might incur significant legal costs and it is uncertain whether we would be able to recover the legal costs from customers or other third parties. In addition, if current California law regarding CPUC's preemptive jurisdiction over regulated public utilities for claims about compliance with California Department of Health Services and United States EPA water quality standards changes, our legal exposure may be significantly increased.Risks Related to Our Business OperationsWastewater operations entail significant risks.While wastewater collection and treatment is not presently a major component of our revenues, wastewater collection and treatment involve many risks associated with damage to the surrounding environment. If collection or treatment systems fail or do not operate properly, untreated or partially treated wastewater could discharge onto property or into nearby streams and rivers, 19Table of Contentscausing property damage or injury to aquatic life, or even human life. Liabilities resulting from such damage could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Demand for our water is subject to various factors and is affected by seasonal fluctuations.Demand for our water during the warmer, dry months is generally greater than during cooler or rainy months due primarily to additional requirements for water in connection with irrigation systems, swimming pools, cooling systems and other outside water use. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically warmer months, demand will vary with temperature and rainfall levels. If temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal, or if there is more rainfall than normal, the demand for our water may decrease. Under the WRAM mechanism, lower water usage in our California operations impacts our cash flows in the year of usage, but results in higher cash flows in the following years.In addition, governmental restrictions on water usage during drought conditions may result in a decreased demand for our water, even if our water reserves are sufficient to serve our customers during these drought conditions. The Commissions may not allow surcharges to collect lost revenues caused by customers' conservation during a drought. Regardless of whether we may surcharge our customers during a conservation period, they may use less water even after a drought has passed because of conservation patterns developed during the drought. Furthermore, our customers may wish to use recycled water as a substitute for potable water. If rights are granted to others to serve our customers recycled water, there will likely be a decrease in demand for our water.Finally, changes in prevailing weather patterns due to climate change may affect customer demand. If increased ambient temperatures affect our service areas, water used for irrigation and cooling may increase. If rainfall patterns change, our customers may change their patterns of water use including the amount of outdoor irrigation and the type of landscape they install. Government agencies may also mandate changes to customer irrigation or landscape patterns in response to changes in weather and climate.The adequacy of our water supplies depends upon a variety of factors beyond our control. Interruption in the water supply may adversely affect our earnings.We depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and future needs of our customers. Whether we have an adequate supply varies depending upon a variety of factors, many of which are partially or completely beyond our control, including:•the amount of rainfall;•the amount of water stored in reservoirs;•underground water supply from which well water is pumped;•availability from water wholesalers;•changes in the amount of water used by our customers;•water quality;•legal limitations on water use such as rationing restrictions during a drought;•changes in prevailing weather patterns and climate; and•population growth.We purchase our water supply from various governmental agencies and others. Water supply availability may be affected by weather conditions, funding and other political and environmental considerations. In addition, our ability to use surface water is subject to regulations regarding water quality and volume limitations. If new regulations are imposed or existing regulations are changed or given new interpretations, the availability of surface water may be materially reduced. A reduction in surface water could result in the need to procure more costly water from other sources, thereby increasing our water production costs and adversely affecting our operating results if not recovered in rates on a timely basis.There is strong scientific consensus that human activity including carbon emissions is changing the chemical and thermodynamic characteristics of the atmosphere and the earth's overall climate. Because scientific efforts have been global in nature, and because climate modeling has not yet been predictive on a local scale, there is tremendous uncertainty over the timing, extent, and types of impacts global climate change may have in our service areas. In addition, studies of tree ring data show long periods of drought conditions have occurred in the historical record in California but prior to our operation. Thus, we include potential climate change risks in our water supply planning activities. We also periodically review the climate change plans of our wholesalers to determine whether alternative supplies may be necessary in the future. However, we can give no assurance that replacement water supplies will be available at a reasonable cost or a cost acceptable to our customers and Commissions.20Table of ContentsWe have entered into long-term water supply agreements, which commit us to making certain minimum payments whether or not we purchase any water. Therefore, if demand is insufficient to use our required purchases we would have to pay for water we did not receive.From time to time, we enter into water supply agreements with third parties and our business is dependent upon such agreements in order to meet regional demand. For example, we have entered into a water supply contract with the SFPUC that expires on June 30, 2034. We can give no assurance that the SFPUC, or any of the other parties from whom we purchase water, will renew our contracts upon expiration, or that we will not be subject to significant price increases under any such renewed contracts.The parties from whom we purchase water maintain significant infrastructure and systems to deliver water to us. Maintenance of these facilities is beyond our control. If these facilities are not adequately maintained or if these parties otherwise default on their obligations to supply water to us, we may not have adequate water supplies to meet our customers' needs.If we are unable to access adequate water supplies we may be unable to satisfy all customer demand, which could result in rationing. Rationing may have an adverse effect on cash flow from operations. We can make no guarantee that we will always have access to an adequate supply of water that will meet all required quality standards. Water shortages may affect us in a variety of ways. For example, shortages could:•adversely affect our supply mix by causing us to rely on more expensive purchased water;•adversely affect operating costs;•increase the risk of contamination to our systems due to our inability to maintain sufficient pressure; and•increase capital expenditures for building pipelines to connect to alternative sources of supply, new wells to replace those that are no longer in service or are otherwise inadequate to meet the needs of our customers and reservoirs and other facilities to conserve or reclaim water.We may or may not be able to recover increased operating and construction costs on a timely basis, or at all, for our regulated systems through the ratemaking process. Although we can give no assurance, we may be able to recover certain of these costs from third parties that may be responsible, or potentially responsible, for groundwater contamination.Changes in water supply costs impact our operations.The cost to obtain water for delivery to our customers varies depending on the sources of supply, wholesale suppliers' prices, the quality of water required to be treated and the quantity of water produced to fulfill customer water demand. Our source of supply varies among our operating districts. Certain districts obtain all of their supply from wells; some districts purchase all of the supply from wholesale suppliers; and other districts obtain the supply from a combination of wells and wholesale suppliers. A small portion of supply comes from surface sources and is processed through Company-owned water treatment plants. On average, slightly more than half of the water we deliver to our customers is pumped from wells or received from a surface supply with the remainder purchased from wholesale suppliers. Water purchased from suppliers usually costs us more than surface supplied or well pumped water. The cost of purchased water for delivery to customers represented 34.8% and 34.0% of our total operating costs in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Water purchased from suppliers will require renewal of our contracts upon expiration and may result in significant price increases under any such renewed contracts.Wholesale water suppliers may increase their prices for water delivered to us based on factors that affect their operating costs. Purchased water rate increases are beyond our control. In California, effective July 1, 2008, our ability to recover increases in the cost of purchased water changed with the adoption of the MCBA. With this change, actual purchased water costs are compared to authorized purchased water costs, with variances netted against the variances in purchased power, pump tax, and metered revenue, being recorded to revenue. The balance in the MCBA will be collected in the future by billing the net WRAM and MCBA accounts receivable balances over 12, 18, and 18+ month periods, which may have a short-term negative impact on cash flow.Dependency upon adequate supply of electricity and certain chemicals could adversely affect our results of operations.Purchased electrical power is required to operate the wells and pumps needed to supply water to our customers. Although there are back-up power generators to operate a number of wells and pumps in emergencies, an extended interruption in power could impact the ability to supply water. In the past, California has been subject to rolling power blackouts due to insufficient power supplies. There is no assurance we will not be subject to power blackouts in the future. Additionally, we require sufficient amounts of certain chemicals in order to treat the water we supply. There are multiple sources for these chemicals but an extended interruption of supply could adversely affect our ability to adequately treat our water.Purchased power is a significant operating expense. During 2017 and 2016, purchased power expense represented 5.0% and 5.1%, respectively, of our total operating costs. These costs are beyond our control and can change unpredictably and substantially 21Table of Contentsas occurred in California during 2001 when rates paid for electricity increased 48%. As with purchased water, purchased power costs are included in the MCBA. Cash flows between rate filings may be adversely affected until the Commission authorizes a rate change, but earnings will be minimally impacted. Cost of chemicals used in the delivery of water is not an element of the MCBA, and therefore, variances in quantity or cost could impact the results of operations.Our business requires significant capital expenditures to replace or improve aging infrastructure that are dependent on our ability to secure appropriate funding. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital or if the rates at which we borrow increase, there would be a negative impact on our results of operations.The water utility business is capital-intensive. We invest significant funds to replace or improve aging infrastructure such as property, plant and equipment. In addition, water shortages may adversely affect us by causing us to rely on more purchased water. This could cause increases in capital expenditures needed to build pipelines to secure alternative water sources. In addition, we require capital to grow our business through acquisitions. We fund our short-term capital requirements from cash received from operations and funds received from developers. We also borrow funds from banks under short-term bank lending arrangements. We seek to meet our long-term capital needs by raising equity through common or preferred stock issues or issuing debt obligations. We cannot give any assurance that these sources will continue to be adequate or that the cost of funds will remain at levels permitting us to earn a reasonable rate of return. In the event we are unable to obtain sufficient capital, our expansion efforts could be curtailed, which may affect our growth and may affect our future results of operations.Our ability to access the capital markets is affected by the ratings of certain of our debt securities. Standard & Poor's Rating Agency issues a rating on California Water Service Company's ability to repay certain debt obligations. The credit rating agency could downgrade our credit rating based on reviews of our financial performance and projections or upon the occurrence of other events that could impact our business outlook. Lower ratings by the agency could restrict our ability to access equity and debt capital. We can give no assurance that the rating agency will maintain ratings which allow us to borrow under advantageous conditions and at reasonable interest rates. A future downgrade by the agency could also increase our cost of capital by causing potential investors to require a higher interest rate due to a perceived risk related to our ability to repay outstanding debt obligations.While the majority of our debt is long term at fixed rates, we do have interest rate exposure in our short-term borrowings which have variable interest rates. We are also subject to interest rate risks on new financings. However, if interest rates were to increase on a long-term basis, our management believes that customer rates would increase accordingly, subject to approval by the appropriate commission. We can give no assurance that the Commission would approve such an increase in customer rates.We are obligated to comply with specified debt covenants under certain of our loan and debt agreements. Failure to maintain compliance with these covenants could limit future borrowing, and we could face increased borrowing costs, litigation, acceleration of maturity schedules, and cross default issues. Such actions by our creditors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Our inability to access the capital or financial markets could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to meet long-term commitments. Changes in economic conditions in our markets could affect our customers' ability to pay for water services. Any of these could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.We rely on our current credit facilities to fund short-term liquidity needs if internal funds are not available from operations. Specifically, given the seasonal fluctuations in demand for our water we commonly draw on our credit facilities to meet our cash requirements at times in the year when demand is relatively low. We also may occasionally use letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facilities. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to draw on our credit facilities. Our access to funds under our credit facilities is dependent on the ability of our banks to meet their funding commitments.Many of our customers and suppliers also have exposure to risks that could affect their ability to meet payment and supply commitments. We operate in geographic areas that may be particularly susceptible to declines in the price of real property, which could result in significant declines in demand for our products and services. In the event that any of our significant customers or suppliers, or a significant number of smaller customers and suppliers, are adversely affected by these risks, we may face disruptions in supply, significant reductions in demand for our products and services, inability of customers to pay invoices when due, and other adverse effects that could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.Our operations and certain contracts for water distribution and treatment depend on the financial capability of state and local governments, and other municipal entities such as water districts. Major disruptions in the financial strength or operations of such entities, such as liquidity limitations, bankruptcy or insolvency, could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business and/or enforce our rights under contracts to which such entities are a party.22Table of ContentsWe are a holding company that depends on cash flow from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock.As a holding company, we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries and our only significant assets are investments in those subsidiaries. 93.9% of our revenues are derived from the operations of California Water Service Company. As a result, we are dependent on cash flow from our subsidiaries, and California Water Service Company in particular, to meet our obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock.Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and generally have no obligation to pay any amounts due on California Water Service Group's debt or to provide California Water Service Group with funds for dividends. Although there are no contractual or regulatory restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us, the reasonableness of our capital structure is one of the factors considered by state and local regulatory agencies in their ratemaking determinations. Therefore, transfer of funds from our subsidiaries to us for the payment of our obligations or dividends may have an adverse effect on ratemaking determinations. Furthermore, our right to receive cash or other assets upon the liquidation or reorganization of a subsidiary is generally subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary. If we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries in a timely manner, we may be unable to meet our obligations or pay dividends.We can make dividend payments only from our surplus (the excess, if any, of our net assets over total paid-in capital) or if there is no surplus, the net profits for the current fiscal year or the fiscal year before which the dividend is declared. In addition, we can pay cash dividends only if after paying those dividends we would be able to pay our liabilities as they become due. Owners of our capital stock cannot force us to pay dividends and dividends will only be paid if and when declared by our board of directors. Our board of directors can elect at any time, and for an indefinite duration, not to declare dividends on our capital stock.An important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems. Risks associated with potential acquisitions, divestitures or restructurings may adversely affect us.We may seek to acquire or invest in other companies, technologies, services or products that complement our business. The execution of our growth strategy may expose us to different risks than those associated with our utility operations. We can give no assurance that we will succeed in finding attractive acquisition candidates or investments, or that we would be able to reach mutually agreeable terms with such parties. In addition, as consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water and wastewater industries, the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase to unacceptable levels and limit our ability to grow through acquisitions. If we are unable to find acquisition candidates or investments, our ability to grow may be limited.Acquisition and investment transactions may result in the issuance of our equity securities that could be dilutive if the acquisition or business opportunity does not develop in accordance with our business plan. They may also result in significant write-offs and an increase in our debt. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Any of these transactions could involve numerous additional risks, including one or more of the following:•problems integrating the acquired operations, personnel, technologies or products with our existing businesses and products;•liabilities inherited from the acquired companies' prior business operations;•diversion of management time and attention from our core business to the acquired business;•failure to retain key technical, management, sales and other personnel of the acquired business;•difficulty in retaining relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired business; and•difficulty in getting required regulatory approvals.In addition, the businesses and other assets we acquire may not achieve the sales and profitability expected. The occurrence of one or more of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these or any other significant risks encountered.We may not be able to increase or sustain our recent growth rate, and we may not be able to manage our future growth effectively.We may be unable to continue to expand our business or manage future growth. To successfully manage our growth and handle the responsibilities of being a public company, we must effectively:•hire, train, integrate and manage additional qualified engineers for engineering design and construction activities, new business personnel, and financial and information technology personnel;23Table of Contents•retain key management, augment our management team, and retain qualified and certified water and wastewater system operators;•implement and improve additional and existing administrative, financial and operations systems, procedures and controls;•expand our technological capabilities; and•manage multiple relationships with our customers, regulators, suppliers and other third parties.If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities, satisfy customer requirements, execute our business plan or respond to competitive pressures.We have a number of large-volume commercial and industrial customers and a significant decrease in consumption by one or more of these customers could have an adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows.Our billed revenues and cash flows from operations will decrease if a significant business or industrial customer terminates or materially reduces its use of our water. Approximately $161.7 million, or 24.3%, of our 2017 water utility revenues was derived from business and industrial customers. However, if any of our large business or industrial customers in California reduce or cease its consumption of our water, the impact to net operating income would be minimal to our operations due to the WRAM and MCBA, but could impact our cash flows. In Hawaii, we serve a number of large resorts which if their water usage was reduced or ceased could have a material impact to our Hawaii operation. The delay between such date and the effective date of the rate relief may be significant and could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.Our operating cost and costs of providing services may rise faster than our revenues.Our ability to increase rates over time is dependent upon approval of such rate increases by the Commissions, or in the case of the City of Hawthorne and the City of Commerce, the City Council, which may be inclined, for political or other reasons, to limit rate increases. However, our costs, which are subject to market conditions and other factors, may increase significantly. The second largest component of our operating costs after water production is made up of salaries and wages. These costs are affected by the local supply and demand for qualified labor. Other large components of our costs are general insurance, workers compensation insurance, employee benefits and health insurance costs. These costs may increase disproportionately to rate increases authorized by the Commissions and may have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.Demand for our stock may fluctuate due to circumstances beyond our control.We believe that stockholders invest in public utility stocks, in part, because they seek reliable dividend payments. If there is an over-supply of stock of public utilities in the market relative to demand by such investors, the trading price of our securities could decrease. Additionally, if interest rates rise above the dividend yield offered by our equity securities, demand for our stock, and consequently its market price, may also decrease. A decline in demand for our stock may have a negative impact on our ability to finance capital projects.Adverse investment returns and other factors may increase our pension liability and pension funding requirements.A substantial number of our employees are covered by a defined benefit pension plan. At present, the pension plan is underfunded because our projected pension benefit obligation exceeds the aggregate fair value of plan assets. Under applicable law, we are required to make cash contributions to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding levels imposed by regulatory requirements. The amount of such required cash contribution is based on an actuarial valuation of the plan. The funded status of the plan can be affected by investment returns on plan assets, discount rates, mortality rates of plan participants, pension reform legislation and a number of other factors. There can be no assurance that the value of our pension plan assets will be sufficient to cover future liabilities. Although we have made contributions to our pension plan in recent years, it is possible that we could incur a pension liability adjustment, or could be required to make additional cash contributions to our pension plan, which would reduce the cash available for business and other needs.Labor relations matters could adversely affect our operating results.At December 31, 2017, 750 of our 1,176 total employees were union employees. Most of our unionized employees are represented by the Utility Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO, except certain engineering and laboratory employees who are represented by the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, AFL-CIO.We believe our labor relations are good, but in light of rising costs for health care and pensions, contract negotiations in the future may be difficult. Furthermore, changes in applicable law or regulations could have an adverse effect on management's negotiating position with respect to our currently unionized employees and/or employees that decide to unionize in the future. We are subject to a risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters as we negotiate with the unions to address these issues, 24Table of Contentswhich could affect our results of operations and financial condition. We can give no assurance that issues with our labor forces will be resolved favorably to us in the future or that we will not experience work stoppages.We depend significantly on the services of the members of our management team, and the departure of any of those persons could cause our operating results to suffer.Our success depends significantly on the continued individual and collective contributions of our management team. The loss of the services of any member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business as our management team has knowledge of our industry and customers and would be difficult to replace.Our operations are geographically concentrated in California and this lack of diversification may negatively impact our operations.Although we own facilities in a number of states, over 93.9% of our operations are located in California. As a result, we are largely subject to weather, political, water supply, labor, energy cost, regulatory and economic risks affecting California.We are also affected by the real property market in California. In order to grow our business, we may need to acquire additional real estate or rights to use real property owned by third parties, the cost of which tends to be higher and more volatile in California than in other states. The value of our assets in California may decline if there is a decline in the California real estate market which results in a significant decrease in real property values.The effects of natural disasters, terrorist activity, pandemics, or poor water quality or contamination to our water supply may result in disruption in our services and litigation which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.We operate in areas that are prone to earthquakes, fires, mudslides and other natural disasters. A significant seismic event or other natural disaster in California where our operations are concentrated could adversely impact our ability to deliver water and adversely affect our costs of operations. A major disaster could damage or destroy substantial capital assets. The CPUC has historically allowed utilities to establish a catastrophic event memorandum account as another possible mechanism to recover costs. However, we can give no assurance that the CPUC or any other commission would allow any such cost recovery mechanism in the future.Our water supplies are subject to contamination, including contamination from the development of naturally-occurring compounds, chemicals in groundwater systems, pollution resulting from man-made sources, such as MTBE, sea water incursion and possible terrorist attacks. If our water supply is contaminated, we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water source. In addition, we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities, or development of new treatment methods. If we are unable to substitute water supply from an uncontaminated water source, or to adequately treat the contaminated water source in a cost-effective manner, there may be an adverse effect on our revenues, operating results and financial condition. The costs we incur to decontaminate a water source or an underground water system could be significant and may not be recoverable in rates. We could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances in our water supplies or other environmental damage. For example, private plaintiffs have the right to bring personal injury or other toxic tort claims arising from the presence of hazardous substances in our drinking water supplies. Our insurance policies may not be sufficient to cover the costs of these claims.We operate a dam. If the dam were to fail for any reason, we would lose a water supply and flooding likely would occur. Whether or not we were responsible for the dam's failure, we could be sued. We can give no assurance that we would be able to successfully defend such a suit.In light of the threats to the nation's health and security ensuing in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, we have taken steps to increase security measures at our facilities and heighten employee awareness of threats to our water supply. We have also tightened our security measures regarding the delivery and handling of certain chemicals used in our business. We have and will continue to bear increased costs for security precautions to protect our facilities, operations and supplies. These costs may be significant. Despite these tightened security measures, we may not be in a position to control the outcome of terrorist events should they occur.We depend upon our skilled and trained workforce to ensure water delivery. Were a pandemic to occur, we can give no assurance that we would be able to maintain sufficient manpower to ensure uninterrupted service in all of the districts that we serve.25Table of ContentsWe retain certain risks not covered by our insurance policies.We evaluate our risks and insurance coverage annually. Our evaluation considers the costs, risks and benefits of retaining versus insuring various risks as well as the availability of certain types of insurance coverage. Furthermore, we are also affected by increases in prices for insurance coverage; in particular, we have been, and will continue to be, affected by rising health insurance costs. Retained risks are associated with deductible limits, partial self-insurance programs and insurance policy coverage ceilings. If we suffer an uninsured loss, we may be unable to pass all, or any portion, of the loss on to customers because our rates are regulated by regulatory commissions. Consequently, uninsured losses may negatively affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will not face uninsured losses pertaining to the risks we have retained.We rely on our information technology (""IT"") and a number of complex business systems to assist with the management of our business and customer and supplier relationships, and a disruption of these systems could adversely affect our business.Our IT systems are an integral part of our business, and a serious disruption of our IT systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently, which, in turn, could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and adversely affect our results of operations. We depend on our IT systems to bill customers, process orders, provide customer service, manage construction projects, manage our financial records, track assets, remotely monitor certain of our plants and facilities and manage human resources, inventory and accounts receivable collections. Our IT systems also enable us to purchase products from our suppliers and bill customers on a timely basis, maintain cost-effective operations and provide service to our customers. Some of our mission and business critical IT systems are older, such as our SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system. Although we do not believe that our IT systems are at a materially greater risk of cyber security incidents than other similar organizations, our IT systems remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from:•power loss, computer systems failures, and internet, telecommunications or data network failures;•operator negligence or improper operation by, or supervision of, employees;•physical and electronic loss of customer data due to security breaches, cyber attacks, misappropriation and similar events;•computer viruses;•intentional security breaches, hacking, denial of services actions, misappropriation of data and similar events; and•earthquakes, floods, fires, mudslides and other natural disasters.These events may result in physical and/or electronic loss of customer or financial data, security breaches, misappropriation and other adverse consequences. In addition, the lack of redundancy for certain of our IT systems, including billing systems, could exacerbate the impact of any of these events on us.In addition, we may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our business, and we might lack sufficient resources to make the necessary upgrades or replacements of our outdated existing technology to allow us to continue to operate at our current level of efficiency.The accuracy of our judgments and estimates about financial and accounting matters will impact our operating results and financial condition.We make certain estimates and judgments in preparing our financial statements regarding, among others:•the useful life of intangible rights;•the number of years to depreciate certain assets;•amounts to set aside for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory obsolescence and uninsured losses;•our legal exposure and the appropriate accrual for claims, including medical claims and workers' compensation claims;•future costs and assumptions for pensions and other postretirement benefits;•regulatory recovery of regulatory assets;•possible tax uncertainties; and•projected collections of WRAM and MCBA receivables.The quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments will have an impact on our operating results and financial condition.26Table of ContentsIn addition, we must estimate unbilled revenues and costs as of the end of each accounting period. If our estimates are not accurate, we will be required to make an adjustment in a future period. Accounting rules permit us to use expense balancing accounts and memorandum accounts that include cost changes to us that are different from amounts incorporated into the rates approved by the Commissions. These accounts result in expenses and revenues being recognized in periods other than in which they occurred.Municipalities, water districts and other public agencies may condemn our property by eminent domain action.State statutes allow municipalities, water districts and other public agencies to own and operate water systems.  These agencies are empowered to condemn water systems or real property owned by privately owned public utilities in certain circumstances and in compliance with California and federal law.  Additionally, whenever a public agency constructs facilities to extend its utility system into the service area of a privately owned public utility, such an act may constitute the taking of property and require reimbursement to the public utility for its loss.  If a public agency were to file an eminent domain lawsuit against us, we would incur substantial attorney’s fees, consultant and expert fees and other costs in considering a challenge to the right to take our utility property and/or its valuation for just compensation, as well as such fees and costs in any subsequent litigation if necessary. If the public agency prevailed and acquired our utility property, we would be entitled to just compensation for our loss, but we would no longer have access to the condemned property or water system.  Neither would we be entitled to any portion of revenue generated from the use of such asset going forward"
16,CWT,CALIFORNIA WATER SERVICE GP,2017-02-23,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
.If any of the following risks actually occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Risks Related to Our Regulatory EnvironmentOur business is heavily regulated by state and federal regulatory agencies and our financial viability depends upon our ability to recover costs from our customers through rates that must be approved by state public utility commissions.California Water Service Company, New Mexico Water Service Company, Washington Water Service Company and Hawaii Water Service Company, Inc., are regulated public utilities which provide water and water-related service to our customers. The rates that we charge our water customers are subject to the jurisdiction of the regulatory commissions in the states in which we operate. These Commissions may set water and water-related rates for each operating district independently because the systems are not interconnected. The Commissions authorize us to charge rates that they consider to be sufficient to recover normal operating expenses, to provide funds for adding new or replacing water infrastructure, and to allow us to earn what the Commissions consider to be a fair and reasonable return on invested capital.Our revenues and consequently our ability to meet our financial objectives are dependent upon the rates we are authorized to charge our customers by the commissions and our ability to recover our costs in these rates. Our management uses forecasts, models and estimates in order to set rates that will provide a fair and reasonable return on our invested capital. While our rates must be approved by the Commissions, no assurance can be given that our forecasts, models and estimates will be correct or that the commissions will agree with our forecasts, models and estimates. If our rates are set too low, our revenues may be insufficient to cover our operating expenses, capital expenditure requirements and desired dividend levels.17Table of ContentsWe periodically file rate increase applications with the Commissions. The ensuing administrative and hearing process may be lengthy and costly. The decisions of the Commissions are beyond our control and we can provide no assurances that our rate increase requests will be granted by the Commissions. Even if approved, there is no guarantee that approval will be given in a timely manner or at a sufficient level to cover our expenses and provide a reasonable return on our investment. If the rate increase decisions are delayed, our earnings may be adversely affected.Our evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets is subject to adjustment by regulatory agencies and any such adjustment could adversely affect our results of operations.Regulatory decisions may also impact prospective revenues and earnings, affect the timing of the recognition of revenues and expenses and may overturn past decisions used in determining our revenues and expenses. Our management continually evaluates the anticipated recovery of regulatory assets and revenues subject to refund and provides for allowances and/or reserves as deemed necessary. Current accounting procedures allow us to defer certain costs if we believe it is probable that we will be allowed to recover those costs through future rate increases. If the Commissions determined that a portion of our assets were not recoverable in customer rates, we may suffer an asset impairment which would require a write down in such asset's valuation which would be recorded through operations.If our assessment as to the probability of recovery through the ratemaking process is incorrect, the associated regulatory asset would be adjusted to reflect the change in our assessment or any regulatory disallowances. A change in our evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets or a regulatory disallowance of all or a portion of our cost could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.Regulatory agencies may disagree with our valuation and characterization of certain of our assets.If we determine that assets are no longer used or useful for utility operations, we may remove them from our rate base and subsequently sell those assets. If the Commissions disagree with our characterization, we could be subjected to penalties. Furthermore, there is a risk that the Commissions could determine that realized appreciation in property value should be awarded to customers rather than our stockholders.Changes in laws, rules and policies of regulatory agencies can significantly affect our business.Regulatory agencies may change their rules and policies for various reasons, including changes in the local political environment. In some states, regulators are elected by popular vote or are appointed by elected officials, and the results of elections may change the long-established rules and policies of an agency dramatically. For example, in 2001 regulation regarding recovery of increases in electrical rates changed in California. For over 20 years prior to 2001, the CPUC allowed recovery of electric rate increases under its operating rules. However, in 2003, the CPUC reinstated its policy to allow utilities to adjust their rates for rate changes by the power companies. The original decision by the CPUC to change its policy, as well as its subsequent decision to reinstate that policy, affected our business.We rely on policies and regulations promulgated by the various state commissions in order to recover capital expenditures, maintain favorable treatment on gains from the sale of real property, offset certain production and operating costs, recover the cost of debt, maintain an optimal equity structure without over-leveraging, and have financial and operational flexibility to engage in non-regulated operations. If any of the Commissions with jurisdiction over us implements policies and regulations that do not allow us to accomplish some or all of the items listed above, our future operating results may be adversely affected.In addition, legislatures may repeal, relax or tighten existing laws, or enact new laws that impact the regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over our business or affect our business directly. If changes in existing laws or the implementation of new laws limit our ability to accomplish some of our business objectives, our future operating results may be adversely affected.We expect environmental health and safety regulation to increase, resulting in higher operating costs in the future.Our water and wastewater services are governed by various federal and state environmental protection, health and safety laws and regulations. These provisions establish criteria for drinking water and for discharges of water, wastewater and airborne substances. The Environmental Protection Agency promulgates numerous nationally applicable standards, including maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for drinking water. We believe we are currently in compliance with all of the MCLs promulgated to date.  Although we have a rigorous water quality assurance program in place, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to comply with all standards. If we violate any federal or state regulations or laws governing health and safety, we could be subject to substantial fines or otherwise sanctioned.Environmental health and safety laws are complex and change frequently. They tend to become more stringent over time. As new or stricter standards are introduced, they could increase our operating costs. Although we would likely seek permission to recover these costs through rate increases, we can give no assurance that the Commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs.18Table of ContentsWe are required to test our water quality for certain chemicals and potential contaminants on a regular basis. If the test results indicate that our water exceeds allowable limits, we may be required either to commence treatment to remove the contaminant or to develop an alternate water source. Either of these results may be costly. Although we would likely seek permission to recover these through rate increases, there can be no assurance that the Commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs.New and/or more stringent water quality regulations could increase our operating costs.We are subject to water quality standards set by federal, state and local authorities that have the power to issue new regulations. Compliance with new regulations that are more stringent than current regulations could increase our operating costs.On July 1, 2014, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) changed the water quality standard for chromium-6 in our water supply. The new standard requires us to have 10 parts per billion or less of chromium-6 in our California water supply. The CPUC authorized a memorandum account in 2014 to track all costs associated with compliance with the new chromium-6 standard. Although we would likely seek permission to recover additional costs of compliance through rate increases, we can give no assurance that the CPUC would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs.Legislation regarding climate change may impact our operations.Future legislation regarding climate change may restrict our operations or impose new costs on our business. Our operations depend on power provided by other public utilities and, in emergencies, power generated by our portable and fixed generators. If future legislation limits emissions from the power generation process, our cost of power may increase. Any increase in the cost of power will be passed along to our California customers through the MCBA or included in our cost of service paid by our customers as requested in our GRC filings. While recovery of these costs is not guaranteed, we would expect recovery in the regulatory process.Starting January 1, 2010, under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), all capital projects of a certain type (primarily wells, tanks, major pipelines and treatment facilities) will require mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. The cost to prepare the CEQA documentation and permit will add an estimated ten thousand dollars to such capital projects. This cost will be included in our capital cost and added to our rate base, which will be requested to be paid for by our customers. Any increase in the operating cost of the facilities will also be included in our cost of service paid by our customers as requested in our GRC filings. While recovery of these costs is not guaranteed, we would expect recovery in the regulatory process.Cap and trade regulations were implemented in 2012 with the goal of reducing emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020. While recovery of these costs is not guaranteed, we would expect recovery in the regulatory process.We are party to a toxic contamination lawsuit which could result in us paying damages not covered by insurance.We have been and may be in the future, party to water contamination lawsuits, which may not be fully covered by insurance.The number of environmental and product-related lawsuits against other water utilities have increased in frequency in recent years. If we are subject to additional environmental or product-related lawsuits, we might incur significant legal costs and it is uncertain whether we would be able to recover the legal costs from customers or other third parties. In addition, if current California law regarding CPUC's preemptive jurisdiction over regulated public utilities for claims about compliance with California Department of Health Services and United States Environmental Protection Agency water quality standards changes, our legal exposure may be significantly increased.Risks Related to Our Business OperationsWastewater operations entail significant risks.While wastewater collection and treatment is not presently a major component of our revenues, wastewater collection and treatment involve many risks associated with damage to the surrounding environment. If collection or treatment systems fail or do not operate properly, untreated or partially treated wastewater could discharge onto property or into nearby streams and rivers, causing property damage or injury to aquatic life, or even human life. Liabilities resulting from such damage could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Demand for our water is subject to various factors and is affected by seasonal fluctuations.Demand for our water during the warmer, dry months is generally greater than during cooler or rainy months due primarily to additional requirements for water in connection with irrigation systems, swimming pools, cooling systems and other outside water use. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically warmer months, demand will vary with temperature and rainfall levels. If temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal, or if there is more rainfall than normal, the 19Table of Contentsdemand for our water may decrease. Under the WRAM mechanism, lower water usage in our California operations impacts our cash flows in the year of usage, but results in higher cash flows in the following years.In addition, governmental restrictions on water usage during drought conditions may result in a decreased demand for our water, even if our water reserves are sufficient to serve our customers during these drought conditions. The Commissions may not allow surcharges to collect lost revenues caused by customers' conservation during a drought. Regardless of whether we may surcharge our customers during a conservation period, they may use less water even after a drought has passed because of conservation patterns developed during the drought. Furthermore, our customers may wish to use recycled water as a substitute for potable water. If rights are granted to others to serve our customers recycled water, there will likely be a decrease in demand for our water.Finally, changes in prevailing weather patterns due to climate change may affect customer demand. If increased ambient temperatures affect our service areas, water used for irrigation and cooling may increase. If rainfall patterns change, our customers may change their patterns of water use including the amount of outdoor irrigation and the type of landscape they install. Government agencies may also mandate changes to customer irrigation or landscape patterns in response to changes in weather and climate.The adequacy of our water supplies depends upon a variety of factors beyond our control. Interruption in the water supply may adversely affect our earnings.We depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and future needs of our customers. Whether we have an adequate supply varies depending upon a variety of factors, many of which are partially or completely beyond our control, including:•the amount of rainfall;•the amount of water stored in reservoirs;•underground water supply from which well water is pumped;•availability from water wholesalers;•changes in the amount of water used by our customers;•water quality;•legal limitations on water use such as rationing restrictions during a drought;•changes in prevailing weather patterns and climate; and•population growth.We purchase our water supply from various governmental agencies and others. Water supply availability may be affected by weather conditions, funding and other political and environmental considerations. In addition, our ability to use surface water is subject to regulations regarding water quality and volume limitations. If new regulations are imposed or existing regulations are changed or given new interpretations, the availability of surface water may be materially reduced. A reduction in surface water could result in the need to procure more costly water from other sources, thereby increasing our water production costs and adversely affecting our operating results if not recovered in rates on a timely basis.There is strong scientific consensus that human activity including carbon emissions is changing the chemical and thermodynamic characteristics of the atmosphere and the earth's overall climate. Because scientific efforts have been global in nature, and because climate modeling has not yet been predictive on a local scale, there is tremendous uncertainty over the timing, extent, and types of impacts global climate change may have in our service areas. In addition, studies of tree ring data show long periods of drought conditions have occurred in the historical record in California but prior to our operation. Thus, we include potential climate change risks in our water supply planning activities. We also periodically review the climate change plans of our wholesalers to determine whether alternative supplies may be necessary in the future. However, we can give no assurance that replacement water supplies will be available at a reasonable cost or a cost acceptable to our customers and Commissions.We have entered into long-term water supply agreements, which commit us to making certain minimum payments whether or not we purchase any water. Therefore, if demand is insufficient to use our required purchases we would have to pay for water we did not receive.From time to time, we enter into water supply agreements with third parties and our business is dependent upon such agreements in order to meet regional demand. For example, we have entered into a water supply contract with the SFPUC that expires on June 30, 2034. We can give no assurance that the SFPUC, or any of the other parties from whom we purchase water, will renew our contracts upon expiration, or that we will not be subject to significant price increases under any such renewed contracts.20Table of ContentsThe parties from whom we purchase water maintain significant infrastructure and systems to deliver water to us. Maintenance of these facilities is beyond our control. If these facilities are not adequately maintained or if these parties otherwise default on their obligations to supply water to us, we may not have adequate water supplies to meet our customers' needs.If we are unable to access adequate water supplies we may be unable to satisfy all customer demand, which could result in rationing. Rationing may have an adverse effect on cash flow from operations. We can make no guarantee that we will always have access to an adequate supply of water that will meet all required quality standards. Water shortages may affect us in a variety of ways. For example, shortages could:•adversely affect our supply mix by causing us to rely on more expensive purchased water;•adversely affect operating costs;•increase the risk of contamination to our systems due to our inability to maintain sufficient pressure; and•increase capital expenditures for building pipelines to connect to alternative sources of supply, new wells to replace those that are no longer in service or are otherwise inadequate to meet the needs of our customers and reservoirs and other facilities to conserve or reclaim water.We may or may not be able to recover increased operating and construction costs on a timely basis, or at all, for our regulated systems through the ratemaking process. Although we can give no assurance, we may be able to recover certain of these costs from third parties that may be responsible, or potentially responsible, for groundwater contamination.Changes in water supply costs impact our operations.The cost to obtain water for delivery to our customers varies depending on the sources of supply, wholesale suppliers' prices, the quality of water required to be treated and the quantity of water produced to fulfill customer water demand. Our source of supply varies among our operating districts. Certain districts obtain all of their supply from wells; some districts purchase all of the supply from wholesale suppliers; and other districts obtain the supply from a combination of wells and wholesale suppliers. A small portion of supply comes from surface sources and is processed through Company-owned water treatment plants. On average, slightly more than half of the water we deliver to our customers is pumped from wells or received from a surface supply with the remainder purchased from wholesale suppliers. Water purchased from suppliers usually costs us more than surface supplied or well pumped water. The cost of purchased water for delivery to customers represented 34.0% and 32.6% of our total operating costs in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Water purchased from suppliers will require renewal of our contracts upon expiration and may result in significant price increases under any such renewed contracts.Wholesale water suppliers may increase their prices for water delivered to us based on factors that affect their operating costs. Purchased water rate increases are beyond our control. In California, effective July 1, 2008, our ability to recover increases in the cost of purchased water changed with the adoption of the MCBA. With this change, actual purchased water costs are compared to authorized purchased water costs, with variances netted against the variances in purchased power, pump tax, and metered revenue, being recorded to revenue. The balance in the MCBA will be collected in the future by billing the net WRAM and MCBA accounts receivable balances over 12, 18, and 18+ month periods, which may have a short-term negative impact on cash flow.Dependency upon adequate supply of electricity and certain chemicals could adversely affect our results of operations.Purchased electrical power is required to operate the wells and pumps needed to supply water to our customers. Although there are back-up power generators to operate a number of wells and pumps in emergencies, an extended interruption in power could impact the ability to supply water. In the past, California has been subject to rolling power blackouts due to insufficient power supplies. There is no assurance we will not be subject to power blackouts in the future. Additionally, we require sufficient amounts of certain chemicals in order to treat the water we supply. There are multiple sources for these chemicals but an extended interruption of supply could adversely affect our ability to adequately treat our water.Purchased power is a significant operating expense. During 2016 and 2015, purchased power expense represented 5.1% and 5.4% of our total operating costs, respectively. These costs are beyond our control and can change unpredictably and substantially as occurred in California during 2001 when rates paid for electricity increased 48%. As with purchased water, purchased power costs are included in the MCBA. Cash flows between rate filings may be adversely affected until the Commission authorizes a rate change, but earnings will be minimally impacted. Cost of chemicals used in the delivery of water is not an element of the MCBA, and therefore, variances in quantity or cost could impact the results of operations.21Table of ContentsOur business requires significant capital expenditures to replace or improve aging infrastructure that are dependent on our ability to secure appropriate funding. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital or if the rates at which we borrow increase, there would be a negative impact on our results of operations.The water utility business is capital-intensive. We invest significant funds to replace or improve aging infrastructure such as property, plant and equipment. In addition, water shortages may adversely affect us by causing us to rely on more purchased water. This could cause increases in capital expenditures needed to build pipelines to secure alternative water sources. In addition, we require capital to grow our business through acquisitions. We fund our short-term capital requirements from cash received from operations and funds received from developers. We also borrow funds from banks under short-term bank lending arrangements. We seek to meet our long-term capital needs by raising equity through common or preferred stock issues or issuing debt obligations. We cannot give any assurance that these sources will continue to be adequate or that the cost of funds will remain at levels permitting us to earn a reasonable rate of return. In the event we are unable to obtain sufficient capital, our expansion efforts could be curtailed, which may affect our growth and may affect our future results of operations.Our ability to access the capital markets is affected by the ratings of certain of our debt securities. Standard & Poor's Rating Agency issues a rating on California Water Service Company's ability to repay certain debt obligations. The credit rating agency could downgrade our credit rating based on reviews of our financial performance and projections or upon the occurrence of other events that could impact our business outlook. Lower ratings by the agency could restrict our ability to access equity and debt capital. We can give no assurance that the rating agency will maintain ratings which allow us to borrow under advantageous conditions and at reasonable interest rates. A future downgrade by the agency could also increase our cost of capital by causing potential investors to require a higher interest rate due to a perceived risk related to our ability to repay outstanding debt obligations.While the majority of our debt is long term at fixed rates, we do have interest rate exposure in our short-term borrowings which have variable interest rates. We are also subject to interest rate risks on new financings. However, if interest rates were to increase on a long-term basis, our management believes that customer rates would increase accordingly, subject to approval by the appropriate commission. We can give no assurance that the Commission would approve such an increase in customer rates.We are obligated to comply with specified debt covenants under certain of our loan and debt agreements. Failure to maintain compliance with these covenants could limit future borrowing, and we could face increased borrowing costs, litigation, acceleration of maturity schedules, and cross default issues. Such actions by our creditors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Our inability to access the capital or financial markets could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to meet long-term commitments. Changes in economic conditions in our markets could affect our customers' ability to pay for water services. Any of these could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.We rely on our current credit facilities to fund short-term liquidity needs if internal funds are not available from operations. Specifically, given the seasonal fluctuations in demand for our water we commonly draw on our credit facilities to meet our cash requirements at times in the year when demand is relatively low. We also may occasionally use letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facilities. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to draw on our credit facilities. Our access to funds under our credit facilities is dependent on the ability of our banks to meet their funding commitments.Many of our customers and suppliers also have exposure to risks that could affect their ability to meet payment and supply commitments. We operate in geographic areas that may be particularly susceptible to declines in the price of real property, which could result in significant declines in demand for our products and services. In the event that any of our significant customers or suppliers, or a significant number of smaller customers and suppliers, are adversely affected by these risks, we may face disruptions in supply, significant reductions in demand for our products and services, inability of customers to pay invoices when due, and other adverse effects that could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.Our operations and certain contracts for water distribution and treatment depend on the financial capability of state and local governments, and other municipal entities such as water districts. Major disruptions in the financial strength or operations of such entities, such as liquidity limitations, bankruptcy or insolvency, could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business and/or enforce our rights under contracts to which such entities are a party.We are a holding company that depends on cash flow from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock.As a holding company, we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries and our only significant assets are investments in those subsidiaries. 93% of our revenues are derived from the operations of California Water Service Company. As a result, we are dependent on cash flow from our subsidiaries, and California Water Service Company in particular, to meet our obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock.22Table of ContentsOur subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and generally have no obligation to pay any amounts due on California Water Service Group's debt or to provide California Water Service Group with funds for dividends. Although there are no contractual or regulatory restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us, the reasonableness of our capital structure is one of the factors considered by state and local regulatory agencies in their ratemaking determinations. Therefore, transfer of funds from our subsidiaries to us for the payment of our obligations or dividends may have an adverse effect on ratemaking determinations. Furthermore, our right to receive cash or other assets upon the liquidation or reorganization of a subsidiary is generally subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary. If we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries in a timely manner, we may be unable to meet our obligations or pay dividends.We can make dividend payments only from our surplus (the excess, if any, of our net assets over total paid-in capital) or if there is no surplus, the net profits for the current fiscal year or the fiscal year before which the dividend is declared. In addition, we can pay cash dividends only if after paying those dividends we would be able to pay our liabilities as they become due. Owners of our capital stock cannot force us to pay dividends and dividends will only be paid if and when declared by our board of directors. Our board of directors can elect at any time, and for an indefinite duration, not to declare dividends on our capital stock.An important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems. Risks associated with potential acquisitions, divestitures or restructurings may adversely affect us.We may seek to acquire or invest in other companies, technologies, services or products that complement our business. The execution of our growth strategy may expose us to different risks than those associated with our utility operations. We can give no assurance that we will succeed in finding attractive acquisition candidates or investments, or that we would be able to reach mutually agreeable terms with such parties. In addition, as consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water and wastewater industries, the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase to unacceptable levels and limit our ability to grow through acquisitions. If we are unable to find acquisition candidates or investments, our ability to grow may be limited.Acquisition and investment transactions may result in the issuance of our equity securities that could be dilutive if the acquisition or business opportunity does not develop in accordance with our business plan. They may also result in significant write-offs and an increase in our debt. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Any of these transactions could involve numerous additional risks, including one or more of the following:•problems integrating the acquired operations, personnel, technologies or products with our existing businesses and products;•liabilities inherited from the acquired companies' prior business operations;•diversion of management time and attention from our core business to the acquired business;•failure to retain key technical, management, sales and other personnel of the acquired business;•difficulty in retaining relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired business; and•difficulty in getting required regulatory approvals.In addition, the businesses and other assets we acquire may not achieve the sales and profitability expected. The occurrence of one or more of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these or any other significant risks encountered.We may not be able to increase or sustain our recent growth rate, and we may not be able to manage our future growth effectively.We may be unable to continue to expand our business or manage future growth. To successfully manage our growth and handle the responsibilities of being a public company, we must effectively:•hire, train, integrate and manage additional qualified engineers for engineering design and construction activities, new business personnel, and financial and information technology personnel;•retain key management, augment our management team, and retain qualified and certified water and wastewater system operators;•implement and improve additional and existing administrative, financial and operations systems, procedures and controls;•expand our technological capabilities; and•manage multiple relationships with our customers, regulators, suppliers and other third parties.23Table of ContentsIf we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities, satisfy customer requirements, execute our business plan or respond to competitive pressures.We have a number of large-volume commercial and industrial customers and a significant decrease in consumption by one or more of these customers could have an adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows.Our billed revenues and cash flows from operations will decrease if a significant business or industrial customer terminates or materially reduces its use of our water. Approximately $151.5 million, or 24.9%, of our 2016 water utility revenues was derived from business and industrial customers. However, if any of our large business or industrial customers in California reduce or cease its consumption of our water, the impact to net operating income would be minimal to our operations due to the WRAM and MCBA, but could impact our cash flows. In Hawaii, we serve a number of large resorts which if their water usage was reduced or ceased could have a material impact to our Hawaii operation. The delay between such date and the effective date of the rate relief may be significant and could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.Our operating cost and costs of providing services may rise faster than our revenues.Our ability to increase rates over time is dependent upon approval of such rate increases by the Commissions, or in the case of the City of Hawthorne and the City of Commerce, the City Council, which may be inclined, for political or other reasons, to limit rate increases. However, our costs, which are subject to market conditions and other factors, may increase significantly. The second largest component of our operating costs after water production is made up of salaries and wages. These costs are affected by the local supply and demand for qualified labor. Other large components of our costs are general insurance, workers compensation insurance, employee benefits and health insurance costs. These costs may increase disproportionately to rate increases authorized by the Commissions and may have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.Demand for our stock may fluctuate due to circumstances beyond our control.We believe that stockholders invest in public utility stocks, in part, because they seek reliable dividend payments. If there is an over-supply of stock of public utilities in the market relative to demand by such investors, the trading price of our securities could decrease. Additionally, if interest rates rise above the dividend yield offered by our equity securities, demand for our stock, and consequently its market price, may also decrease. A decline in demand for our stock may have a negative impact on our ability to finance capital projects.Adverse investment returns and other factors may increase our pension liability and pension funding requirements.A substantial number of our employees are covered by a defined benefit pension plan. At present, the pension plan is underfunded because our projected pension benefit obligation exceeds the aggregate fair value of plan assets. Under applicable law, we are required to make cash contributions to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding levels imposed by regulatory requirements. The amount of such required cash contribution is based on an actuarial valuation of the plan. The funded status of the plan can be affected by investment returns on plan assets, discount rates, mortality rates of plan participants, pension reform legislation and a number of other factors. There can be no assurance that the value of our pension plan assets will be sufficient to cover future liabilities. Although we have made contributions to our pension plan in recent years, it is possible that we could incur a pension liability adjustment, or could be required to make additional cash contributions to our pension plan, which would reduce the cash available for business and other needs.Labor relations matters could adversely affect our operating results.At December 31, 2016, 741 of our 1,163 total employees were union employees. Most of our unionized employees are represented by the Utility Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO, except certain engineering and laboratory employees who are represented by the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, AFL-CIO.We believe our labor relations are good, but in light of rising costs for health care and pensions, contract negotiations in the future may be difficult. Furthermore, changes in applicable law or regulations could have an adverse effect on management's negotiating position with respect to our currently unionized employees and/or employees that decide to unionize in the future. We are subject to a risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters as we negotiate with the unions to address these issues, which could affect our results of operations and financial condition. We can give no assurance that issues with our labor forces will be resolved favorably to us in the future or that we will not experience work stoppages.We depend significantly on the services of the members of our management team, and the departure of any of those persons could cause our operating results to suffer.Our success depends significantly on the continued individual and collective contributions of our management team. The loss of the services of any member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business as our management team has knowledge of our industry and customers and would be difficult to replace.24Table of ContentsOur operations are geographically concentrated in California and this lack of diversification may negatively impact our operations.Although we own facilities in a number of states, over 93% of our operations are located in California. As a result, we are largely subject to weather, political, water supply, labor, energy cost, regulatory and economic risks affecting California.We are also affected by the real property market in California. In order to grow our business, we may need to acquire additional real estate or rights to use real property owned by third parties, the cost of which tends to be higher and more volatile in California than in other states. The value of our assets in California may decline if there is a decline in the California real estate market which results in a significant decrease in real property values.The effects of natural disasters, terrorist activity, pandemics, or poor water quality or contamination to our water supply may result in disruption in our services and litigation which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.We operate in areas that are prone to earthquakes, fires, mudslides and other natural disasters. A significant seismic event or other natural disaster in California where our operations are concentrated could adversely impact our ability to deliver water and adversely affect our costs of operations. A major disaster could damage or destroy substantial capital assets. The CPUC has historically allowed utilities to establish a catastrophic event memorandum account as another possible mechanism to recover costs. However, we can give no assurance that the CPUC or any other commission would allow any such cost recovery mechanism in the future.Our water supplies are subject to contamination, including contamination from the development of naturally-occurring compounds, chemicals in groundwater systems, pollution resulting from man-made sources, such as MTBE, sea water incursion and possible terrorist attacks. If our water supply is contaminated, we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water source. In addition, we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities, or development of new treatment methods. If we are unable to substitute water supply from an uncontaminated water source, or to adequately treat the contaminated water source in a cost-effective manner, there may be an adverse effect on our revenues, operating results and financial condition. The costs we incur to decontaminate a water source or an underground water system could be significant and may not be recoverable in rates. We could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances in our water supplies or other environmental damage. For example, private plaintiffs have the right to bring personal injury or other toxic tort claims arising from the presence of hazardous substances in our drinking water supplies. Our insurance policies may not be sufficient to cover the costs of these claims.We operate a dam. If the dam were to fail for any reason, we would lose a water supply and flooding likely would occur. Whether or not we were responsible for the dam's failure, we could be sued. We can give no assurance that we would be able to successfully defend such a suit.In light of the threats to the nation's health and security ensuing in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, we have taken steps to increase security measures at our facilities and heighten employee awareness of threats to our water supply. We have also tightened our security measures regarding the delivery and handling of certain chemicals used in our business. We have and will continue to bear increased costs for security precautions to protect our facilities, operations and supplies. These costs may be significant. Despite these tightened security measures, we may not be in a position to control the outcome of terrorist events should they occur.We depend upon our skilled and trained workforce to ensure water delivery. Were a pandemic to occur, we can give no assurance that we would be able to maintain sufficient manpower to ensure uninterrupted service in all of the districts that we serve.We retain certain risks not covered by our insurance policies.We evaluate our risks and insurance coverage annually. Our evaluation considers the costs, risks and benefits of retaining versus insuring various risks as well as the availability of certain types of insurance coverage. Furthermore, we are also affected by increases in prices for insurance coverage; in particular, we have been, and will continue to be, affected by rising health insurance costs. Retained risks are associated with deductible limits, partial self-insurance programs and insurance policy coverage ceilings. If we suffer an uninsured loss, we may be unable to pass all, or any portion, of the loss on to customers because our rates are regulated by regulatory commissions. Consequently, uninsured losses may negatively affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will not face uninsured losses pertaining to the risks we have retained.25Table of ContentsWe rely on our information technology (""IT"") and a number of complex business systems to assist with the management of our business and customer and supplier relationships, and a disruption of these systems could adversely affect our business.Our IT systems are an integral part of our business, and a serious disruption of our IT systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently, which, in turn, could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and adversely affect our results of operations. We depend on our IT systems to bill customers, process orders, provide customer service, manage construction projects, manage our financial records, track assets, remotely monitor certain of our plants and facilities and manage human resources, inventory and accounts receivable collections. Our IT systems also enable us to purchase products from our suppliers and bill customers on a timely basis, maintain cost-effective operations and provide service to our customers. Some of our mission and business critical IT systems are older, such as our SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system. Although we do not believe that our IT systems are at a materially greater risk of cyber security incidents than other similar organizations, our IT systems remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from:•power loss, computer systems failures, and internet, telecommunications or data network failures;•operator negligence or improper operation by, or supervision of, employees;•physical and electronic loss of customer data due to security breaches, cyber attacks, misappropriation and similar events;•computer viruses;•intentional security breaches, hacking, denial of services actions, misappropriation of data and similar events; and•earthquakes, floods, fires, mudslides and other natural disasters.These events may result in physical and/or electronic loss of customer or financial data, security breaches, misappropriation and other adverse consequences. In addition, the lack of redundancy for certain of our IT systems, including billing systems, could exacerbate the impact of any of these events on us.In addition, we may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our business, and we might lack sufficient resources to make the necessary upgrades or replacements of our outdated existing technology to allow us to continue to operate at our current level of efficiency.The accuracy of our judgments and estimates about financial and accounting matters will impact our operating results and financial condition.We make certain estimates and judgments in preparing our financial statements regarding, among others:•the useful life of intangible rights;•the number of years to depreciate certain assets;•amounts to set aside for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory obsolescence and uninsured losses;•our legal exposure and the appropriate accrual for claims, including medical claims and workers' compensation claims;•future costs and assumptions for pensions and other postretirement benefits;•regulatory recovery of regulatory assets;•possible tax uncertainties; and•projected collections of WRAM and MCBA receivables.The quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments will have an impact on our operating results and financial condition.In addition, we must estimate unbilled revenues and costs as of the end of each accounting period. If our estimates are not accurate, we will be required to make an adjustment in a future period. Accounting rules permit us to use expense balancing accounts and memorandum accounts that include cost changes to us that are different from amounts incorporated into the rates approved by the Commissions. These accounts result in expenses and revenues being recognized in periods other than in which they occurred.26Table of ContentsMunicipalities, water districts and other public agencies may condemn our property by eminent domain action.State statutes allow municipalities, water districts and other public agencies to own and operate water systems.  These agencies are empowered to condemn water systems or real property owned by privately owned public utilities in certain circumstances and in compliance with California and federal law.  Additionally, whenever a public agency constructs facilities to extend its utility system into the service area of a privately owned public utility, such an act may constitute the taking of property and require reimbursement to the public utility for its loss.  If a public agency were to file an eminent domain lawsuit against us, we would incur substantial attorney’s fees, consultant and expert fees and other costs in considering a challenge to the right to take our utility property and/or its valuation for just compensation, as well as such fees and costs in any subsequent litigation if necessary. If the public agency prevailed and acquired our utility property, we would be entitled to just compensation for our loss, but we would no longer have access to the condemned property or water system.  Neither would we be entitled to any portion of revenue generated from the use of such asset going forward"

.If any of the following risks actually occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Risks Related to Our Regulatory EnvironmentOur business is heavily regulated by state and federal regulatory agencies and our financial viability depends upon our ability to recover costs from our customers through rates that must be approved by state public utility commissions.California Water Service Company, New Mexico Water Service Company, Washington Water Service Company and Hawaii Water Service Company, Inc., are regulated public utilities which provide water and water related service to our customers. The rates that we charge our water customers are subject to the jurisdiction of the regulatory commissions in the states in which we operate. These Commissions may set water and water related rates for each operating district independently because the systems are not interconnected. The Commissions authorize us to charge rates which they consider to be sufficient to recover normal operating expenses, to provide funds for adding new or replacing water infrastructure, and to allow us to earn what the Commissions consider to be a fair and reasonable return on invested capital.Our revenues and consequently our ability to meet our financial objectives are dependent upon the rates we are authorized to charge our customers by the commissions and our ability to recover our costs in these rates. Our management uses forecasts, models and estimates in order to set rates that will provide a fair and reasonable return on our invested capital. While our rates must be approved by the Commissions, no assurance can be given that our forecasts, models and estimates will be correct or that the commissions will agree with our forecasts, models and estimates. If our rates are set too low, our revenues may be insufficient to cover our operating expenses, capital expenditure requirements and desired dividend levels.We periodically file rate increase applications with the Commissions. The ensuing administrative and hearing process may be lengthy and costly. The decisions of the Commissions are beyond our control and we can provide no assurances that our rate increase requests will be granted by the Commissions. Even if approved, there is no guarantee that approval will be given in a timely manner or at a sufficient level to cover our expenses and provide a reasonable return on our investment. If the rate increase decisions are delayed, our earnings may be adversely affected.Our evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets is subject to adjustment by regulatory agencies and any such adjustment could adversely affect our results of operations.Regulatory decisions may also impact prospective revenues and earnings, affect the timing of the recognition of revenues and expenses and may overturn past decisions used in determining our revenues and expenses. Our management continually evaluates the anticipated recovery of regulatory assets and revenues subject to refund and provides for allowances and/or reserves as deemed necessary. Current accounting procedures allow us to defer certain costs if we believe it is probable that we will be allowed to recover those costs by future rate increases. If the Commissions determined that a portion of our assets were not recoverable in customer rates, we may suffer an asset impairment which would require a write down in such asset's valuation which would be recorded through operations.17Table of ContentsIf our assessment as to the probability of recovery through the ratemaking process is incorrect, the associated regulatory asset would be adjusted to reflect the change in our assessment or any regulatory disallowances. A change in our evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets or a regulatory disallowance of all or a portion of our cost could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.Regulatory agencies may disagree with our valuation and characterization of certain of our assets.If we determine that assets are no longer used or useful for utility operations, we may remove them from our rate base and subsequently sell those assets. If the Commissions disagree with our characterization, we could be subjected to penalties. Furthermore, there is a risk that the Commissions could determine that realized appreciation in property value should be awarded to customers rather than our stockholders.Changes in laws, rules and policies of regulatory agencies can significantly affect our business.Regulatory agencies may change their rules and policies for various reasons, including changes in the local political environment. In some states, regulators are elected by popular vote or are appointed by elected officials, and the results of elections may change the long-established rules and policies of an agency dramatically. For example, in 2001 regulation regarding recovery of increases in electrical rates changed in California. For over 20 years prior to 2001, the CPUC allowed recovery of electric rate increases under its operating rules. However, in 2003, the CPUC reinstated its policy to allow utilities to adjust their rates for rate changes by the power companies. The original decision by the CPUC to change its policy, as well as its subsequent decision to reinstate that policy, affected our business.We rely on policies and regulations promulgated by the various state commissions in order to recover capital expenditures, maintain favorable treatment on gains from the sale of real property, offset certain production and operating costs, recover the cost of debt, maintain an optimal equity structure without over-leveraging, and have financial and operational flexibility to engage in non-regulated operations. If any of the Commissions with jurisdiction over us implements policies and regulations that do not allow us to accomplish some or all of the items listed above, our future operating results may be adversely affected.In addition, legislatures may repeal, relax or tighten existing laws, or enact new laws that impact the regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over our business or affect our business directly. If changes in existing laws or the implementation of new laws limit our ability to accomplish some of our business objectives, our future operating results may be adversely affected.We expect environmental health and safety regulation to increase, resulting in higher operating costs in the future.Our water and wastewater services are governed by various federal and state environmental protection, health and safety laws, and regulations. These provisions establish criteria for drinking water and for discharges of water, wastewater and airborne substances. The Environmental Protection Agency promulgates numerous nationally applicable standards, including maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for drinking water. We believe we are currently in compliance with all of the MCLs promulgated to date but we can give no assurance that we will continue to comply with all water quality requirements. If we violate any federal or state regulations or laws governing health and safety, we could be subject to substantial fines or otherwise sanctioned.Environmental health and safety laws are complex and change frequently. They tend to become more stringent over time. As new or stricter standards are introduced, they could increase our operating costs. Although we would likely seek permission to recover these costs through rate increases, we can give no assurance that the Commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs.We are required to test our water quality for certain chemicals and potential contaminants on a regular basis. If the test results indicate that we exceed allowable limits, we may be required either to commence treatment to remove the contaminant or to develop an alternate water source. Either of these results may be costly, and there can be no assurance that the Commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs.New and more stringent water quality regulations could increase our operating costs.We are subject to water quality standards set by federal, state and local authorities that have the power to issue new regulations. Compliance with new regulations that are more stringent than current regulations could increase our operating costs.On July 1, 2014, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) changed the water quality standard for chromium-6 in our water supply. The new standard requires us to have 10 parts per billion or less of chromium-6 in our California water supply. We have two districts where every well does not comply with the new standard. The new standard is expected to restrict water supply and significantly increase capital spending and operation expenses in the impacted districts. The CPUC authorized a memorandum account in 2014 to track all costs associated with compliance with the new chromium-6 standard. Although we would likely seek permission to recover additional costs of compliance through rate increases, we can give no assurance that the CPUC would approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional compliance costs.18Table of ContentsLegislation regarding climate change may impact our operations.Future legislation regarding climate change may restrict our operations or impose new costs on our business. Our operations depend on power provided by other public utilities and, in emergencies, power generated by our portable and fixed generators. If future legislation limits emissions from the power generation process, our cost of power may increase. Any increase in the cost of power will be passed along to our California customers through the MCBA or included in our cost of service paid by our customers as requested in our general rate case filings. While recovery of these costs is not guaranteed, we would expect recovery in the regulatory process.Starting January 1, 2010, under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), all capital projects of a certain type (primarily wells, tanks, major pipelines and treatment facilities) will require mitigation of green house gas emissions. The cost to prepare the CEQA documentation and permit will add an estimated ten thousand dollars to such capital projects. This cost will be included in our capital cost and added to our rate base, which will be requested to be paid for by our customers. Any increase in the operating cost of the facilities will also be included in our cost of service paid by our customers as requested in our general rate case filings. While recovery of these costs is not guaranteed, we would expect recovery in the regulatory process.Cap and trade regulations were implemented in 2012 with the goal of reducing emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020. While recovery of these costs is not guaranteed, we would expect recovery in the regulatory process.We are party to a toxic contamination lawsuit which could result in us paying damages not covered by insurance.We have been and may be in the future, party to water contamination lawsuits, which may not be fully covered by insurance.The number of environmental and product-related lawsuits against other water utilities have increased in frequency in recent years. If we are subject to additional environmental or product-related lawsuits, we might incur significant legal costs and it is uncertain whether we would be able to recover the legal costs from customers or other third parties. In addition, if current California law regarding CPUC's preemptive jurisdiction over regulated public utilities for claims about compliance with California Department of Health Services and United States Environmental Protection Agency water quality standards changes, our legal exposure may be significantly increased.Risks Related to Our Business OperationsWastewater operations entail significant risks.While wastewater collection and treatment is not presently a major component of our revenues, wastewater collection and treatment involve many risks associated with damage to the surrounding environment. If collection or treatment systems fail or do not operate properly, untreated or partially treated wastewater could discharge onto property or into nearby streams and rivers, causing property damage or injury to aquatic life, or even human life. Liabilities resulting from such damage could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Demand for our water is subject to various factors and is affected by seasonal fluctuations.Demand for our water during the warmer, dry months is generally greater than during cooler or rainy months due primarily to additional requirements for water in connection with irrigation systems, swimming pools, cooling systems and other outside water use. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically warmer months, demand will vary with temperature and rainfall levels. If temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal, or if there is more rainfall than normal, the demand for our water may decrease. Under the WRAM mechanism, lower water usage in our California operations impacts our cash flows in the year of usage, but results in higher cash flows in the following years.In addition, governmental restrictions on water usage during drought conditions may result in a decreased demand for our water, even if our water reserves are sufficient to serve our customers during these drought conditions. The Commissions for our non-California operations may not allow surcharges to collect lost revenues caused by customers' conservation during the drought. Regardless of whether we may surcharge our customers during a conservation period, they may use less water even after a drought has passed because of conservation patterns developed during the drought. Furthermore, our customers may wish to use recycled water as a substitute for potable water. If rights are granted to others to serve our customers recycled water, there will likely be a decrease in demand for our water.Finally, changes in prevailing weather patterns due to climate change may affect customer demand. If increased ambient temperatures affect our service areas, water used for irrigation and cooling may increase. If rainfall patterns change, our customers may change their patterns of water use including the amount of outdoor irrigation and the type of landscape they install. Government agencies may also mandate changes to customer irrigation or landscape patterns in response to changes in weather and climate.19Table of ContentsThe adequacy of our water supplies depends upon a variety of factors beyond our control. Interruption in the water supply may adversely affect our earnings.We depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and future needs of our customers. Whether we have an adequate supply varies depending upon a variety of factors, many of which are partially or completely beyond our control, including:•the amount of rainfall;•the amount of water stored in reservoirs;•underground water supply from which well water is pumped;•availability from water wholesalers;•changes in the amount of water used by our customers;•water quality;•legal limitations on water use such as rationing restrictions during a drought;•changes in prevailing weather patterns and climate; and•population growth.We purchase our water supply from various governmental agencies and others. Water supply availability may be affected by weather conditions, funding and other political and environmental considerations. In addition, our ability to use surface water is subject to regulations regarding water quality and volume limitations. If new regulations are imposed or existing regulations are changed or given new interpretations, the availability of surface water may be materially reduced. A reduction in surface water could result in the need to procure more costly water from other sources, thereby increasing our water production costs and adversely affecting our operating results if not timely recovered in rates.There is strong scientific consensus that human activity including carbon emissions is changing the chemical and thermodynamic characteristics of the atmosphere and the earth's overall climate. Because scientific efforts have been global in nature, and because climate modeling has not yet been predictive on a local scale, there is tremendous uncertainty over the timing, extent, and types of impacts global climate change may have in our service areas. In addition, studies of tree ring data show long periods of drought conditions have occurred in the historical record in California but prior to our operation. Thus, we include potential climate change risks in our water supply planning activities. We also periodically review the climate change plans of our wholesalers to determine whether alternative supplies may be necessary in the future. However, we can give no assurance that replacement water supplies will be available at a reasonable cost or a cost acceptable to our customers and Commissions.We have entered into long-term water supply agreements, which commit us to making certain minimum payments whether or not we purchase any water. Therefore, if demand is insufficient to use our required purchases we would have to pay for water we did not receive.From time to time, we enter into water supply agreements with third parties and our business is dependent upon such agreements in order to meet regional demand. For example, we have entered into a water supply contract with the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission that expires on June 30, 2034. We can give no assurance that the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, or any of the other parties from whom we purchase water, will renew our contracts upon expiration, or that we will not be subject to significant price increases under any such renewed contracts.The parties from whom we purchase water maintain significant infrastructure and systems to deliver water to us. Maintenance of these facilities is beyond our control. If these facilities are not adequately maintained or if these parties otherwise default on their obligations to supply water to us, we may not have adequate water supplies to meet our customers' needs.If we are unable to access adequate water supplies we may be unable to satisfy all customer demand which could result in rationing. Rationing may have an adverse effect on cash flow from operations. We can make no guarantee that we will always have access to an adequate supply of water that will meet all required quality standards. Water shortages may affect us in a variety of ways. For example, shortages could:•adversely affect our supply mix by causing us to rely on more expensive purchased water;•adversely affect operating costs;•increase the risk of contamination to our systems due to our inability to maintain sufficient pressure; and20Table of Contents•increase capital expenditures for building pipelines to connect to alternative sources of supply, new wells to replace those that are no longer in service or are otherwise inadequate to meet the needs of our customers and reservoirs and other facilities to conserve or reclaim water.We may or may not be able to recover increased operating and construction costs on a timely basis, or at all, for our regulated systems through the ratemaking process. Although we can give no assurance, we may be able to recover certain of these costs from third parties that may be responsible, or potentially responsible, for groundwater contamination.Changes in water supply costs impact our operations.The cost to obtain water for delivery to our customers varies depending on the sources of supply, wholesale suppliers' prices, the quality of water required to be treated and the quantity of water produced to fulfill customer water demand. Our source of supply varies among our operating districts. Certain districts obtain all of their supply from wells; some districts purchase all of the supply from wholesale suppliers; and other districts obtain the supply from a combination of wells and wholesale suppliers. A small portion of supply comes from surface sources and is processed through Company-owned water treatment plants. On average, slightly more than half of the water we deliver to our customers is pumped from wells or received from a surface supply with the remainder purchased from wholesale suppliers. Water purchased from suppliers usually costs us more than surface supplied or well pumped water. The cost of purchased water for delivery to customers represented 32.6% and 34.5% of our total operating costs in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Water purchased from suppliers will require renewal of our contracts upon expiration and may result in significant price increases under any such renewed contracts.Wholesale water suppliers may increase their prices for water delivered to us based on factors that affect their operating costs. Purchased water rate increases are beyond our control. In California, effective July 1, 2008, our ability to recover increases in the cost of purchased water changed with the adoption of the MCBA. With this change, actual purchased water costs are compared to authorized purchased water costs, with variances netted against the variances in purchased power, pump tax, and metered revenue, being recorded to revenue. The balance in the MCBA will be collected in the future by billing the net WRAM and MCBA accounts receivable balances over 12, 18, and 20+ month periods, which may have a short-term negative impact on cash flow.Dependency upon adequate supply of electricity and certain chemicals could adversely affect our results of operations.Purchased electrical power is required to operate the wells and pumps needed to supply water to our customers. Although there are back-up power generators to operate a number of wells and pumps in emergencies, an extended interruption in power could impact the ability to supply water. In the past, California has been subject to rolling power blackouts due to insufficient power supplies. There is no assurance we will not be subject to power blackouts in the future. Additionally, we require sufficient amounts of certain chemicals in order to treat the water we supply. There are multiple sources for these chemicals but an extended interruption of supply could adversely affect our ability to adequately treat our water.Purchased power is a significant operating expense. During 2015 and 2014, purchased power expense represented 5.4% and 6.4% of our total operating costs, respectively. These costs are beyond our control and can change unpredictably and substantially as occurred in California during 2001 when rates paid for electricity increased 48%. As with purchased water, purchased power costs are included in the MCBA. Cash flows between rate filings may be adversely affected until the commission authorizes a rate change but earnings will be minimally impacted. Cost of chemicals used in the delivery of water is not an element of the MCBA and therefore variances in quantity or cost could impact the results of operations.Our business requires significant capital expenditures to replace or improve aging infrastructure that are dependent on our ability to secure appropriate funding. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital or if the rates at which we borrow increase, there would be a negative impact on our results of operations.The water utility business is capital-intensive. We invest significant funds to replace or improve aging infrastructure such as property, plant and equipment. In addition, water shortages may adversely affect us by causing us to rely on more purchased water. This could cause increases in capital expenditures needed to build pipelines to secure alternative water sources. In addition, we require capital to grow our business through acquisitions. We fund our short-term capital requirements from cash received from operations and funds received from developers. We also borrow funds from banks under short-term bank lending arrangements. We seek to meet our long-term capital needs by raising equity through common or preferred stock issues or issuing debt obligations. We cannot give any assurance that these sources will continue to be adequate or that the cost of funds will remain at levels permitting us to earn a reasonable rate of return. In the event we are unable to obtain sufficient capital, our expansion efforts could be curtailed, which may affect our growth and may affect our future results of operations.Our ability to access the capital markets is affected by the ratings of certain of our debt securities. Standard & Poor's Rating Agency issues a rating on California Water Service Company's ability to repay certain debt obligations. The credit rating agency could downgrade our credit rating based on reviews of our financial performance and projections or upon the occurrence of other events that could impact our business outlook. Lower ratings by the agency could restrict our ability to access equity and debt 21Table of Contentscapital. We can give no assurance that the rating agency will maintain ratings which allow us to borrow under advantageous conditions and at reasonable interest rates. A future downgrade by the agency could also increase our cost of capital by causing potential investors to require a higher interest rate due to a perceived risk related to our ability to repay outstanding debt obligations.While the majority of our debt is long term at fixed rates, we do have interest rate exposure in our short-term borrowings which have variable interest rates. We are also subject to interest rate risks on new financings. However, if interest rates were to increase on a long-term basis, our management believes that customer rates would increase accordingly, subject to approval by the appropriate commission. We can give no assurance that the commission would approve such an increase in customer rates.We are obligated to comply with specified debt covenants under certain of our loan and debt agreements. Failure to maintain compliance with these covenants could limit future borrowing, and we could face increased borrowing costs, litigation, acceleration of maturity schedules, and cross default issues. Such actions by our creditors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Our inability to access the capital or financial markets could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to meet long-term commitments. Changes in economic conditions in our markets could affect our customers' ability to pay for water services. Any of these could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.We rely on our current credit facilities to fund short-term liquidity needs if internal funds are not available from operations. Specifically, given the seasonal fluctuations in demand for our water we commonly draw on our credit facilities to meet our cash requirements at times in the year when demand is relatively low. We also may occasionally use letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facilities. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to draw on our credit facilities. Our access to funds under our credit facilities is dependent on the ability of our banks to meet their funding commitments.Many of our customers and suppliers also have exposure to risks that could affect their ability to meet payment and supply commitments. We operate in geographic areas that may be particularly susceptible to declines in the price of real property, which could result in significant declines in demand for our products and services. In the event that any of our significant customers or suppliers, or a significant number of smaller customers and suppliers, are adversely affected by these risks, we may face disruptions in supply, significant reductions in demand for our products and services, inability of customers to pay invoices when due, and other adverse effects that could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.Our operations and certain contracts for water distribution and treatment depend on the financial capability of state and local governments, and other municipal entities such as water districts. Major disruptions in the financial strength or operations of such entities, such as liquidity limitations, bankruptcy or insolvency, could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business and/or enforce our rights under contracts to which such entities are a party.We are a holding company that depends on cash flow from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock.As a holding company, we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries and our only significant assets are investments in those subsidiaries. 94% of our revenues are derived from the operations of California Water Service Company. As a result, we are dependent on cash flow from our subsidiaries, and California Water Service Company in particular, to meet our obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock.Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and generally have no obligation to pay any amounts due on California Water Service Group's debt or to provide California Water Service Group with funds for dividends. Although there are no contractual or regulatory restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us, the reasonableness of our capital structure is one of the factors considered by state and local regulatory agencies in their ratemaking determinations. Therefore, transfer of funds from our subsidiaries to us for the payment of our obligations or dividends may have an adverse effect on ratemaking determinations. Furthermore, our right to receive cash or other assets upon the liquidation or reorganization of a subsidiary is generally subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary. If we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries in a timely manner, we may be unable to meet our obligations or pay dividends.We can make dividend payments only from our surplus (the excess, if any, of our net assets over total paid-in capital) or if there is no surplus, the net profits for the current fiscal year or the fiscal year before which the dividend is declared. In addition, we can pay cash dividends only if after paying those dividends we would be able to pay our liabilities as they become due. Owners of our capital stock cannot force us to pay dividends and dividends will only be paid if and when declared by our board of directors. Our board of directors can elect at any time, and for an indefinite duration, not to declare dividends on our capital stock.22Table of ContentsAn important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems. Risks associated with potential acquisitions, divestitures or restructurings may adversely affect us.We may seek to acquire or invest in other companies, technologies, services or products that complement our business. The execution of our growth strategy may expose us to different risks than those associated with our utility operations. We can give no assurance that we will succeed in finding attractive acquisition candidates or investments, or that we would be able to reach mutually agreeable terms with such parties. In addition, as consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water and wastewater industries, the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase to unacceptable levels and limit our ability to grow through acquisitions. If we are unable to find acquisition candidates or investments, our ability to grow may be limited.Acquisition and investment transactions may result in the issuance of our equity securities that could be dilutive if the acquisition or business opportunity does not develop in accordance with our business plan. They may also result in significant write-offs and an increase in our debt. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Any of these transactions could involve numerous additional risks, including one or more of the following:•problems integrating the acquired operations, personnel, technologies or products with our existing businesses and products;•liabilities inherited from the acquired companies' prior business operations;•diversion of management time and attention from our core business to the acquired business;•failure to retain key technical, management, sales and other personnel of the acquired business;•difficulty in retaining relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired business; and•difficulty in getting required regulatory approvals.In addition, the businesses and other assets we acquire may not achieve the sales and profitability expected. The occurrence of one or more of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these or any other significant risks encountered.We may not be able to increase or sustain our recent growth rate, and we may not be able to manage our future growth effectively.We may be unable to continue to expand our business or manage future growth. To successfully manage our growth and handle the responsibilities of being a public company, we must effectively:•hire, train, integrate and manage additional qualified engineers for engineering design and construction activities, new business personnel, and financial and information technology personnel;•retain key management, augment our management team, and retain qualified and certified water and wastewater system operators;•implement and improve additional and existing administrative, financial and operations systems, procedures and controls;•expand our technological capabilities; and•manage multiple relationships with our customers, regulators, suppliers and other third parties.If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities, satisfy customer requirements, execute our business plan or respond to competitive pressures.We have a number of large-volume commercial and industrial customers and a significant decrease in consumption by one or more of these customers could have an adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows.Our billed revenues and cash flows from operations will decrease if a significant business or industrial customer terminates or materially reduces its use of our water. Approximately $148.4 million, or 25.2%, of our 2015 water utility revenues was derived from business and industrial customers. However, if any of our large business or industrial customers in California reduce or cease its consumption of our water, the impact to net operating income would be minimal to our operations due to the WRAM and MCBA, but could impact our cash flows. In Hawaii, we serve a number of large resorts which if their water usage was reduced or ceased could have a material impact to our Hawaii operation. The delay between such date and the effective date of the rate relief may be significant and could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.23Table of ContentsOur operating cost and costs of providing services may rise faster than our revenues.Our ability to increase rates over time is dependent upon approval of such rate increases by the Commissions, or in the case of the City of Hawthorne and the City of Commerce, the City Council, which may be inclined, for political or other reasons, to limit rate increases. However, our costs, which are subject to market conditions and other factors, which may increase significantly. The second largest component of our operating costs after water production is made up of salaries and wages. These costs are affected by the local supply and demand for qualified labor. Other large components of our costs are general insurance, workers compensation insurance, employee benefits and health insurance costs. These costs may increase disproportionately to rate increases authorized by the Commissions and may have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.Demand for our stock may fluctuate due to circumstances beyond our control.We believe that stockholders invest in public utility stocks, in part, because they seek reliable dividend payments. If there is an over-supply of stock of public utilities in the market relative to demand by such investors, the trading price of our securities could decrease. Additionally, if interest rates rise above the dividend yield offered by our equity securities, demand for our stock, and consequently its market price, may also decrease. A decline in demand for our stock may have a negative impact on our ability to finance capital projects.Adverse investment returns and other factors may increase our pension liability and pension funding requirements.A substantial number of our employees are covered by a defined benefit pension plan. At present, the pension plan is underfunded because our projected pension benefit obligation exceeds the aggregate fair value of plan assets. Under applicable law, we are required to make cash contributions to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding levels imposed by regulatory requirements. The amount of such required cash contribution is based on an actuarial valuation of the plan. The funded status of the plan can be affected by investment returns on plan assets, discount rates, mortality rates of plan participants, pension reform legislation and a number of other factors. There can be no assurance that the value of our pension plan assets will be sufficient to cover future liabilities. Although we have made contributions to our pension plan in recent years, it is possible that we could incur a pension liability adjustment, or could be required to make additional cash contributions to our pension plan, which would reduce the cash available for business and other needs.Work stoppages and other labor relations matters could adversely affect our operating results.At December 31, 2015, 731 of our 1,155 total employees were union employees. Most of our unionized employees are represented by the Utility Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO, except certain engineering and laboratory employees who are represented by the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, AFL-CIO.We believe our labor relations are good, but in light of rising costs for health care and pensions, contract negotiations in the future may be difficult. Furthermore, changes in applicable law or regulations could have an adverse effect on management's negotiating position with respect to our currently unionized employees and/or employees that decide to unionize in the future. We are subject to a risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters as we negotiate with the unions to address these issues, which could affect our results of operations and financial condition. We can give no assurance that issues with our labor forces will be resolved favorably to us in the future or that we will not experience work stoppages.We depend significantly on the services of the members of our management team, and the departure of any of those persons could cause our operating results to suffer.Our success depends significantly on the continued individual and collective contributions of our management team. The loss of the services of any member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business as our management team has knowledge of our industry and customers and would be difficult to replace.Our operations are geographically concentrated in California and this lack of diversification may negatively impact our operations.Although we own facilities in a number of states, over 94% of our operations are located in California. As a result, we are largely subject to weather, political, water supply, labor, energy cost, regulatory and economic risks affecting California.We are also affected by the real property market in California. In order to grow our business, we may need to acquire additional real estate or rights to use real property owned by third parties, the cost of which tends to be higher and more volatile in California relative to other states. The value of our assets in California may decline if there is a decline in the California real estate market which results in a significant decrease in real property values.24Table of ContentsThe effects of natural disasters, terrorist activity, pandemics, or poor water quality or contamination to our water supply may result in disruption in our services and litigation which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.We operate in areas that are prone to earthquakes, fires, mudslides and other natural disasters. A significant seismic event or other natural disaster in California where our operations are concentrated could adversely impact our ability to deliver water and adversely affect our costs of operations. A major disaster could damage or destroy substantial capital assets. The CPUC has historically allowed utilities to establish a catastrophic event memorandum account as another possible mechanism to recover costs. However, we can give no assurance that the CPUC or any other commission would allow any such cost recovery mechanism in the future.Our water supplies are subject to contamination, including contamination from the development of naturally-occurring compounds, chemicals in groundwater systems, pollution resulting from man-made sources, such as MTBE, sea water incursion and possible terrorist attacks. If our water supply is contaminated, we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water source. In addition, we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities, or development of new treatment methods. If we are unable to substitute water supply from an uncontaminated water source, or to adequately treat the contaminated water source in a cost-effective manner, there may be an adverse effect on our revenues, operating results and financial condition. The costs we incur to decontaminate a water source or an underground water system could be significant and may not be recoverable in rates. We could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances in our water supplies or other environmental damage. For example, private plaintiffs have the right to bring personal injury or other toxic tort claims arising from the presence of hazardous substances in our drinking water supplies. Our insurance policies may not be sufficient to cover the costs of these claims.We operate a dam. If the dam were to fail for any reason, we would lose a water supply and flooding likely would occur. Whether or not we were responsible for the dam's failure, we could be sued. We can give no assurance that we would be able to successfully defend such a suit.In light of the threats to the nation's health and security ensuing in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, we have taken steps to increase security measures at our facilities and heighten employee awareness of threats to our water supply. We have also tightened our security measures regarding the delivery and handling of certain chemicals used in our business. We have and will continue to bear increased costs for security precautions to protect our facilities, operations and supplies. These costs may be significant. Despite these tightened security measures, we may not be in a position to control the outcome of terrorist events should they occur.We depend upon our skilled and trained workforce to ensure water delivery. Were a pandemic to occur, we can give no assurance that we would be able to maintain sufficient manpower to ensure uninterrupted service in all of the districts that we serve.We retain certain risks not covered by our insurance policies.We evaluate our risks and insurance coverage annually. Our evaluation considers the costs, risks and benefits of retaining versus insuring various risks as well as the availability of certain types of insurance coverage. Furthermore, we are also affected by increases in prices for insurance coverage; in particular, we have been, and will continue to be, affected by rising health insurance costs. Retained risks are associated with deductible limits, partial self-insurance programs and insurance policy coverage ceilings. If we suffer an uninsured loss, we may be unable to pass all, or any portion, of the loss on to customers because our rates are regulated by regulatory commissions. Consequently, uninsured losses may negatively affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will not face uninsured losses pertaining to the risks we have retained.We rely on our information technology (""IT"") and a number of complex business systems to assist with the management of our business and customer and supplier relationships, and a disruption of these systems could adversely affect our business.Our IT systems are an integral part of our business, and a serious disruption of our IT systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently, which, in turn, could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and adversely affect our results of operations. We depend on our IT systems to bill customers, process orders, provide customer service, manage construction projects, manage our financial records, track assets, remotely monitor certain of our plants and facilities and manage human resources, inventory and accounts receivable collections. Our IT systems also enable us to purchase products from our suppliers and bill customers on a timely basis, maintain cost-effective operations and provide service to our customers. Some of our mission and business critical IT systems are older, such as our SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system. Although we do not believe that our IT systems are at a materially greater risk of cyber security incidents than other similar organizations, our IT systems remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from:25Table of Contents•power loss, computer systems failures, and internet, telecommunications or data network failures;•operator negligence or improper operation by, or supervision of, employees;•physical and electronic loss of customer data due to security breaches, cyber attacks, misappropriation and similar events;•computer viruses;•intentional security breaches, hacking, denial of services actions, misappropriation of data and similar events; and•Earthquakes, floods, fires, mudslides and other natural disasters.These events may result in physical and/or electronic loss of customer or financial data, security breaches, misappropriation and other adverse consequences. In addition, the lack of redundancy for certain of our IT systems, including billing systems, could exacerbate the impact of any of these events on us.In addition, we may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our business, and we might lack sufficient resources to make the necessary upgrades or replacements of our outdated existing technology to allow us to continue to operate at our current level of efficiency.The accuracy of our judgments and estimates about financial and accounting matters will impact our operating results and financial condition.We make certain estimates and judgments in preparing our financial statements regarding, among others:•the useful life of intangible rights;•the number of years to depreciate certain assets;•amounts to set aside for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory obsolescence and uninsured losses;•our legal exposure and the appropriate accrual for claims, including medical claims and workers' compensation claims;•future costs and assumptions for pensions and other post-retirement benefits;•regulatory recovery of regulatory assets;•possible tax uncertainties; and•projected collections of WRAM and MCBA receivables.The quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments will have an impact on our operating results and financial condition.In addition, we must estimate unbilled revenues and costs as of the end of each accounting period. If our estimates are not accurate, we will be required to make an adjustment in a future period. Accounting rules permit us to use expense balancing accounts and memorandum accounts that include cost changes to us that are different from amounts incorporated into the rates approved by the commissions. These accounts result in expenses and revenues being recognized in periods other than in which they occurred.Municipalities, water districts and other public agencies may condemn our property by eminent domain action.State statutes allow municipalities, water districts and other public agencies to own and operate water systems.  These agencies are empowered to condemn water systems or real property  owned  by privately owned public utilities in certain circumstances and in compliance with California and federal law.  Additionally, whenever a public agency constructs facilities to extend its utility system into the service area of a privately owned public utility, such an act may constitute the taking of property and require reimbursement to the public utility for its loss.  If a public agency were to file an eminent domain lawsuit against us, we would incur substantial attorney’s fees, consultant and expert fees and other costs in considering a challenge to the right to take our utility property and/or its valuation for just compensation, as well as such fees and costs in any subsequent litigation if necessary. If the public agency prevailed and acquired our utility property,  we would be entitled to just compensation for our loss, but we would no longer have access to the condemned property or water system.  Neither would we be entitled to any portion of revenue generated from the use of such asset going forward"

9,CWT,CALIFORNIA WATER SERVICE GP,2011-03-01,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors.     The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only    ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that    management is not aware of or focused on or that management    currently deems immaterial may also impair our business    operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our    financial condition and results of operations could be    materially and adversely affected. Risks    Related to Our Regulatory Environment Our    business is heavily regulated by state and federal regulatory    agencies and our financial viability depends upon our ability to    recover costs from our customers through rates that must be    approved by state public utility commissions.     California Water Service Company, New Mexico Water Service    Company, Washington Water Service Company and Hawaii Water    Service Company, Inc., are regulated public utilities which    provide water service to our customers. The rates that we charge    our water customers are subject to the jurisdiction of the    regulatory commissions in the states in which we operate. These    commissions set water rates for each operating district    independently because the systems are not interconnected. The    commissions authorize us to charge rates which they consider to    be sufficient to recover normal operating expenses, to provide    funds for adding new or replacing water infrastructure, and to    allow us to earn what the commissions consider to be a fair and    reasonable return on invested capital.     Our revenues and consequently our ability to meet our financial    objectives are dependent upon the rates we are authorized to    charge our customers by the commissions and our ability to    recover our costs in these rates. Our management uses forecasts,    models and estimates in order to set rates that will provide a    fair and reasonable return on our invested capital. While our    rates must be approved by the commissions, no assurance can be    given that our forecasts, models and estimates will be correct    or that the commissions will agree with our forecasts, models    and    18Table of Contents    estimates. If our rates are set too low, our revenues may be    insufficient to cover our operating expenses, capital    expenditure requirements and desired dividend levels.     We periodically file rate increase applications with the    commissions. The ensuing administrative and hearing process may    be lengthy and costly. The decisions of the commissions are    beyond our control and we can provide no assurances that our    rate increase requests will be granted by the commissions. Even    if approved, there is no guarantee that approval will be given    in a timely manner or at a sufficient level to cover our    expenses and provide a reasonable return on our investment. If    the rate increase decisions are delayed, our earnings may be    adversely affected. Our    evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets    is subject to adjustment by regulatory agencies and any such    adjustment could adversely affect our results of    operations.     Regulatory decisions may also impact prospective revenues and    earnings, affect the timing of the recognition of revenues and    expenses and may overturn past decisions used in determining our    revenues and expenses. Our management continually evaluates the    anticipated recovery of regulatory assets, liabilities, and    revenues subject to refund and provides for allowances    and/or    reserves as deemed necessary. Current accounting procedures    allow us to defer certain costs if we believe it is probable    that we will be allowed to recover those costs by future rate    increases. If a commission determined that a portion of our    assets were not recoverable in customer rates, we may suffer an    asset impairment which would require a write down in such    assets valuation which would be recorded through    operations.     If our assessment as to the probability of recovery through the    ratemaking process is incorrect, the associated regulatory asset    or liability would be adjusted to reflect the change in our    assessment or any regulatory disallowances. A change in our    evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets    or a regulatory disallowance of all or a portion of our cost    could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Regulatory    agencies may disagree with our valuation and characterization of    certain of our assets.     If we determine that assets are no longer used or useful for    utility operations, we may remove them from our rate base and    subsequently sell those assets. If the commission disagrees with    our characterization, we could be subjected to penalties.    Furthermore, there is a risk that the commission could determine    that appreciation in property value should be awarded to the    ratepayers rather than our stockholders. Changes    in laws, rules and policies of regulatory agencies can    significantly affect our business.     Regulatory agencies may change their rules and policies for    various reasons, including changes in the local political    environment. In some states, regulators are elected by popular    vote or are appointed by elected officials, and the results of    elections may change the long-established rules and policies of    an agency dramatically. For example, in 2001 regulation    regarding recovery of increases in electrical rates changed in    California. For over 20 years prior to 2001, the California    Public Utilities Commission allowed recovery of electric rate    increases under its operating rules. However, in 2003, the    commission reinstated its policy to allow utilities to adjust    their rates for rate changes by the power companies. The    original decision by the commission to change its policy, as    well as its subsequent decision to reinstate that policy,    affected our business.     We rely on policies and regulations promulgated by the various    state commissions in order to recover capital expenditures,    maintain favorable treatment on gains from the sale of real    property, offset certain production and operating costs, recover    the cost of debt, maintain an optimal equity structure without    over-leveraging, and have financial and operational flexibility    to engage in non-regulated operations. If any of the commissions    with jurisdiction over us implements policies and regulations    that do not allow us to accomplish some or all of the items    listed above, our future operating results may be adversely    affected.     In addition, legislatures may repeal, relax or tighten existing    laws, or enact new laws that impact the regulatory agencies with    jurisdiction over our business or affect our business directly.    If changes in existing laws or the implementation of new laws    limit our ability to accomplish some or all of our business    objectives, our future operating results may be adversely    affected.    19Table of ContentsWe    expect environmental regulation to increase, resulting in higher    operating costs in the future.     Our water and wastewater services are governed by various    federal and state environmental protection, health and safety    laws, and regulations. These provisions establish criteria for    drinking water and for discharges of water, wastewater and    airborne substances. The Environmental Protection Agency    promulgates numerous nationally applicable standards, including    maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for drinking water. We believe    we are currently in compliance with all of the MCLs promulgated    to date but we can give no assurance that we will continue to    comply with all water quality requirements. If we violate any    federal or state regulations or laws governing health and    safety, we could be subject to substantial fines or otherwise    sanctioned.     Environmental laws are complex and change frequently. They tend    to become more stringent over time. As new or stricter standards    are introduced, they could increase our operating costs.    Although we would likely seek permission to recover these costs    through rate increases, we can give no assurance that the    commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover    these additional compliance costs.     We are required to test our water quality for certain chemicals    and potential contaminants on a regular basis. If the test    results indicate that we exceed allowable limits, we may be    required either to commence treatment to remove the contaminant    or to develop an alternate water source. Either of these results    may be costly, and there can be no assurance that the    commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover    these additional compliance costs. Legislation    regarding climate change may impact our operations     Future legislation regarding climate change may restrict our    operations or impose new costs on our business. Our operations    depend on power provided by other public utilities and, in    emergencies, power generated by our portable and fixed    generators. If future legislation limits emissions from the    power generation process, our cost of power may increase. Any    increase in the cost of power will be passed along to our    California rate payers through the MCBA or included in our cost    of service paid by our rate payers as requested in our general    rate case filings. While recovery of these costs are not    guaranteed, we would expect recovery in the regulatory process.     The Low Carbon Fuel Standard Program, which went into effect    January 1, 2011, requires diesel engines to use low carbon    fuel such as biodiesel or other alternatives. This may increase    the operating cost of our generators and vehicles.     We maintain a fleet of vehicles to provide service to our    customers, including a number of heavy duty diesel vehicles that    we retrofitted by the end of 2010 to meet California emission    standards. If future legislation further impacts the cost to    operate the fleet or the fleet acquisition cost in order to meet    certain emission standards, it will increase our cost of service    and our rate base. Any increase in fleet operating costs    associated with meeting emission standards will be included in    our cost of service paid by our rate payers as requested in our    general rate case filings. While recovery of these costs are not    guaranteed, we would expect recovery in the regulatory process.     Starting January 1, 2010, under the California    Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), all capital projects of a    certain type (primarily wells, tanks, major pipelines and    treatment facilities) will require mitigation of green house gas    emissions. The cost to prepare the CEQA documentation and permit    will add an estimated ten thousand dollars to such capital    projects. This cost will be included in our capital cost and    added to our rate base, which will be requested to be paid for    by our rate payers. Any increase in the operating cost of the    facilities will also be included in our cost of service paid by    our rate payers as requested in our general rate case filings.    While recovery of these costs are not guaranteed, we would    expect recovery in the regulatory process.     Proposed cap and trade regulations are scheduled to be    implemented in 2012 with the goal of reducing emissions to 1990    levels by the year 2020. Under such regulations, if approved, we    will be required to determine our carbon footprint and evaluate    our electricity and fuel usage (both diesel and gasoline). We    will also be required to evaluate methane emissions from our    primary processes in our wastewater plants. At this time we are    unable to determine the cost impact of such regulations but any    increase in operating costs associated with the cap and trade    regulations will be included in our cost of service requested to    be paid by our rate payers as requested in our general rate case    filings. While recovery of these costs are not guaranteed, we    would expect recovery in the regulatory process.    20Table of ContentsWe are    party to a toxic contamination lawsuit which could result in our    paying damages not covered by insurance.     In 1995, the State of Californias Department of Toxic    Substances Control (DTSC) named us as a potential responsible    party for cleanup of a toxic contamination plume in the Chico    groundwater. In December 2002, we were named along with other    defendants in two lawsuits filed by DTSC for the cleanup of the    plumes. The toxic spill occurred when cleaning solvents, which    were discharged into the citys sewer system by local dry    cleaners, leaked into the underground water supply. The DTSC    contends that our responsibility stems from our operation of    wells in the surrounding vicinity that caused the contamination    plumes to spread. While we are cooperating with the clean up, we    deny any responsibility for the contamination or the resulting    cleanup.     In 2007, the Company entered into Court approved consent decrees    (Consent Decrees). The Consent Decrees conditioned the    Companys performance upon many factors, including, but not    limited to, water pumped and treated by the Company must meet    regulatory standards so the Company may distribute to its    customers. Pursuant to the terms of the Consent Decrees, the    Company will incur capital costs of $1.5 million and future    operating costs with a present value of approximately    $2.6 million. In its 2007 general rate case (GRC)    settlement negotiations, Division of Ratepayer Advocates agreed    to track all costs associated with the Consent Decrees including    legal costs to pursue insurance coverage for potential future    recovery in rates.     In connection with these suits, our insurance carrier, Employers    Insurance of Wausau (Wausau) filed a separate lawsuit against us    for reimbursement of past defense costs, which approximate    $1.5 million, and a declaratory determination of coverage.    On January 23, 2008, the Court heard various parties    motions and on September 25, 2008 issued its rulings that    Wausau had a duty to defend; therefore, the Company will not    have to reimburse Wausau for previously incurred defense costs.    The Court did not find Wausaus actions were intended to    harm the Company so the Company will not be able to recover    punitive damages. However, the Court also found that the issue    of policy coverage would be determined at trial. Trial commenced    on June 1, 2009. During trial, the parties entered into a    confidential settlement agreement which did not have a    significant impact on the Companys results of operations.    The confidential settlement was fully executed on June 23,    2009 and the lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice by the court    in October 2009.     The number of environmental and product-related lawsuits against    other water utilities have increased in frequency in recent    years. If we are subject to additional environmental or    product-related lawsuits, we might incur significant legal costs    and it is uncertain whether we would be able to recover the    legal costs from ratepayers or other third parties. In addition,    if current California law regarding California Public Utilities    Commissions preemptive jurisdiction over regulated public    utilities for claims about compliance with California Department    of Health Services and United States Environmental Protection    Agency water quality standards changes, our legal exposure may    be significantly increased. Risks    Related to Our Business Operations Wastewater    operations entail significant risks.     While wastewater collection and treatment is not presently a    major component of our revenues, wastewater collection and    treatment involve many risks associated with damage to the    surrounding environment. If collection or treatment systems fail    or do not operate properly, untreated or partially treated    wastewater could discharge onto property or into nearby streams    and rivers, causing property damage or injury to aquatic life,    or even human life. Liabilities resulting from such damage could    materially and adversely affect our results of operations and    financial condition. Demand    for our water is subject to various factors and is affected by    seasonal fluctuations.     Demand for our water during the warmer, dry months is generally    greater than during cooler or rainy months due primarily to    additional requirements for water in connection with irrigation    systems, swimming pools, cooling systems and other outside water    use. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically    warmer months, demand will vary with temperature and rainfall    levels. If temperatures during the typically warmer months are    cooler than normal, or if there is more rainfall than normal,    the demand for our water may decrease.    21Table of Contents    In addition, governmental restrictions on water usage during    drought conditions may result in a decreased demand for our    water, even if our water reserves are sufficient to serve our    customers during these drought conditions. However, during the    drought of the late 1980s and early 1990s the    California Public Utilities Commission beginning in 1992 allowed    us to surcharge our customers to collect lost revenues caused by    customers conservation during the drought. Regardless of    whether we may surcharge our customers during a conservation    period, they may use less water even after a drought has passed    because of conservation patterns developed during the drought.    Furthermore, our customers may wish to use recycled water as a    substitute for potable water. If rights are granted to others to    serve our customers recycled water, there will likely be a    decrease in demand for our water. The    adequacy of our water supplies depends upon a variety of factors    beyond our control. Interruption in the water supply may    adversely affect our earnings.     We depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and    future needs of our customers. Whether we have an adequate    supply varies depending upon a variety of factors, many of which    are partially or completely beyond our control, including:           the amount of rainfall;           the amount of water stored in reservoirs;           underground water supply from which well water is pumped;           changes in the amount of water used by our customers;           water quality;           legal limitations on water use such as rationing restrictions    during a drought; and           population growth.     We purchase our water supply from various governmental agencies    and others. Water supply availability may be affected by weather    conditions, funding and other political and environmental    considerations. In addition, our ability to use surface water is    subject to regulations regarding water quality and volume    limitations. If new regulations are imposed or existing    regulations are changed or given new interpretations, the    availability of surface water may be materially reduced. A    reduction in surface water could result in the need to procure    more costly water from other sources, thereby increasing our    water production costs and adversely affecting our operating    results.     We have entered into long-term water supply agreements, which    commit us to making certain minimum payments whether or not we    purchase any water. Therefore, if demand is insufficient to use    our required purchases we would have to pay for water we did not    receive.     From time to time, we enter into water supply agreements with    third parties and our business is dependent upon such agreements    in order to meet regional demand. For example, we have entered    into a water supply contract with the San Francisco Public    Utilities Commission that expires on June 30, 2034. We can    give no assurance that the San Francisco Public Utilities    Commission, or any of the other parties from whom we purchase    water, will renew our contracts upon expiration, or that we will    not be subject to significant price increases under any such    renewed contracts.     The parties from whom we purchase water maintain significant    infrastructure and systems to deliver water to us. Maintenance    of these facilities is beyond our control. If these facilities    are not adequately maintained or if these parties otherwise    default on their obligations to supply water to us, we may not    have adequate water supplies to meet our customers needs.     If we are unable to access adequate water supplies we may be    unable to satisfy all customer demand which could result in    rationing. Rationing may have an adverse effect on cash flow    from operations. We can make no guarantee that we will always    have access to an adequate supply of water that will meet all    required quality standards. Water shortages may affect us in a    variety of ways. For example, shortages could:           adversely affect our supply mix by causing us to rely on more    expensive purchased water;    22Table of Contents           adversely affect operating costs;           increase the risk of contamination to our systems due to our    inability to maintain sufficient pressure; and           increase capital expenditures for building pipelines to connect    to alternative sources of supply, new wells to replace those    that are no longer in service or are otherwise inadequate to    meet the needs of our customers and reservoirs and other    facilities to conserve or reclaim water.     We may or may not be able to recover increased operating and    construction costs on a timely basis, or at all, for our    regulated systems through the ratemaking process. Although we    can give no assurance, we may also be able to recover certain of    these costs from third parties that may be responsible, or    potentially responsible, for groundwater contamination. Changes    in water supply costs impact our operations.     The cost to obtain water for delivery to our customers varies    depending on the sources of supply, wholesale suppliers    prices, the quality of water required to be treated and the    quantity of water produced to fulfill customer water demand. Our    source of supply varies among our operating districts. Certain    districts obtain all of their supply from wells; some districts    purchase all of the supply from wholesale suppliers; and other    districts obtain the supply from a combination of wells and    wholesale suppliers. A small portion of supply comes from    surface sources and is processed through Company-owned water    treatment plants. On average, slightly more than half of the    water we deliver to our customers is pumped from wells or    received from a surface supply with the remainder purchased from    wholesale suppliers. Water purchased from suppliers usually    costs us more than surface supplied or well pumped water. The    cost of purchased water for delivery to customers represented    31.6% and 31.2% of our total operating costs in 2010 and 2009,    respectively.     Wholesale water suppliers may increase their prices for water    delivered to us based on factors that affect their operating    costs. Purchased water rate increases are beyond our control. In    California, effective July 1, 2008, our ability to recover    increases in the cost of purchased water changed with the    adoption of the MCBA. With this change, actual purchased water    costs are compared to authorized purchased water costs with    variances, netted against variance in purchased power, pump tax,    and metered revenue, recorded to revenue. The balance in the    MCBA will be collected in the future by billing the net WRAM and    MCBA accounts receivable balances over 12 and 24 month    periods, which may have a short-term negative impact on cash    flow. Dependency    upon adequate supply of electricity and certain chemicals could    adversely affect our results of operations.     Purchased electrical power is required to operate the wells and    pumps needed to supply water to our customers. Although there    are back-up    power generators to operate a number of wells and pumps in    emergencies, an extended interruption in power could impact the    ability to supply water. In the past, California has been    subject to rolling power blackouts due to insufficient power    supplies. There is no assurance we will not be subject to power    blackouts in the future. Additionally, we require sufficient    amounts of certain chemicals in order to treat the water we    supply. There are multiple sources for these chemicals but an    extended interruption of supply could adversely affect our    ability to adequately treat our water.     Purchased power is a significant operating expense. During 2010    and 2009, purchased power expense represented 7.4% and 7.2% of    our total operating costs. These costs are beyond our control    and can change unpredictably and substantially as occurred in    California during 2001 when rates paid for electricity increased    48%. As with purchased water, purchased power costs are included    in the MCBA. Cash flows between rate filings may be adversely    affected until the commission authorizes a rate change but    earnings will be minimally impacted. Cost of chemicals used in    the delivery of water is not an element of the MCBA and    therefore variances in quantity or cost could impact the results    of operations.    23Table of ContentsOur    ability to generate new operating contracts or renewal of    existing operating contracts is affected by local    politics.     Our revenue and non-regulated revenue growth depends upon our    ability to generate new as well as renew operating contracts    with cities, other agencies and municipal utility districts. As    our services are sold in a political environment, there is    exposure to changing trends and municipal preferences. Recent    terrorist acts have affected some political viewpoints relative    to outsourcing of water or wastewater utility services.    Municipalities own and municipal employees operate the majority    of water and wastewater systems. Significant marketing and sales    efforts are spent demonstrating the benefits of contract    operations to elected officials and municipal authorities. The    existing political environment means decisions affecting our    business are based on many factors, not just economic factors. Our    business requires significant capital expenditures that are    dependent on our ability to secure appropriate funding. If we    are unable to obtain sufficient capital or if the rates at which    we borrow increase, there would be a negative impact on our    results of operations.     The water utility business is capital-intensive. We invest    significant funds to add or replace property, plant and    equipment. In addition, water shortages may adversely affect us    by causing us to rely on more purchased water. This could cause    increases in capital expenditures needed to build pipelines to    secure alternative water sources. In addition, we require    capital to grow our business through acquisitions. We fund our    short-term capital requirements from cash received from    operations and funds received from developers. We also borrow    funds from banks under short-term bank lending arrangements. We    seek to meet our long-term capital needs by raising equity    through common or preferred stock issues or issuing debt    obligations. We cannot give any assurance that these sources    will continue to be adequate or that the cost of funds will    remain at levels permitting us to earn a reasonable rate of    return. In the event we are unable to obtain sufficient capital,    our expansion efforts could be curtailed, which may affect our    growth and may affect our future results of operations.     Our ability to access the capital markets is affected by the    ratings of certain of our debt securities. Standard &    Poors Rating Agency issues a rating on California Water    Service Companys ability to repay certain debt    obligations. The credit rating agency could downgrade our credit    rating based on reviews of our financial performance and    projections or upon the occurrence of other events that could    impact our business outlook. Lower ratings by the agency could    restrict our ability to access equity and debt capital. We can    give no assurance that the rating agency will maintain ratings    which allow us to borrow under advantageous conditions and at    reasonable interest rates. A future downgrade by the agency    could also increase our cost of capital by causing potential    investors to require a higher interest rate due to a perceived    risk related to our ability to repay outstanding debt    obligations.     While the majority of our debt is long term at fixed rates, we    do have interest rate exposure in our short-term borrowings    which have variable interest rates. We are also subject to    interest rate risks on new financings. However, if interest    rates were to increase on a long-term basis, our management    believes that customer rates would increase accordingly, subject    to approval by the appropriate commission. We can give no    assurance that the commission would approve such an increase in    customer rates.     We are obligated to comply with specified debt covenants under    certain of our loan and debt agreements. Failure to maintain    compliance with these covenants could limit future borrowing,    and we could face increased borrowing costs, litigation,    acceleration of maturity schedules, and cross default issues.    Such actions by our creditors could have a material adverse    effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Adverse    changes to the national and world-wide financial system could    result in disruptions in the financial and real estate markets    availability and cost of short-term funds for our liquidity    requirements, our ability to meet long-term commitments, and our    customers ability to pay for water services. Any of these    could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and    financial condition.     We rely on our current credit facilities to fund short-term    liquidity needs if internal funds are not available from    operations. Specifically, given the seasonal fluctuations in    demand for our water we commonly draw on our credit facilities    to meet our cash requirements at times in the year when demand    is relatively low. We also may    24Table of Contents    occasionally use letters of credit issued under our revolving    credit facilities. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets    or further deterioration in the strength of financial    institutions could adversely affect our ability to draw on our    credit facilities. Our access to funds under our credit    facilities is dependent on the ability of our banks to meet its    funding commitments.     Longer-term disruptions in the financial markets as a result of    uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced    capital-raising alternatives, or failures of significant    financial institutions or other factors could adversely affect    our access to liquidity. Any disruption could require us to take    measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until    alternative credit arrangements or other funding for business    needs can be arranged. Such measures could include deferring    capital expenditures, dividend payments or other discretionary    uses of cash.     Many of our customers and suppliers also have exposure to risks    that their ability to meet their payment and supply commitments    are adversely affected by the worldwide financial crisis and    recession in the United States and resulting potential    disruptions in the financial and real estate markets. We operate    in geographic areas that may be particularly susceptible to    declines in the price of real property and other consequences of    the financial crisis, which could result in significant declines    in demand for our products and services in certain of our    districts. In the event that any of our significant customers or    suppliers, or a significant number of smaller customers and    suppliers, are adversely affected by these risks, we may face    disruptions in supply, significant reductions in demand for our    products and services, inability of customers to pay invoices    when due, and other adverse effects that could negatively affect    our financial condition, results of operations    and/or cash    flows.     Our operations and certain contracts for water distribution and    treatment depend on the financial capability of state and local    governments, and other municipal entities such as water    districts. Major disruptions in the financial strength or    operations of such entities, such as liquidity limitations,    bankruptcy or insolvency, could have an adverse effect on our    ability to conduct our business    and/or    enforce our rights under contracts to which such entities are a    party. We are    a holding company that depends on cash flow from our    subsidiaries to meet our obligations and to pay dividends on our    common stock.     As a holding company, we conduct substantially all of our    operations through our subsidiaries and our only significant    assets are investments in those subsidiaries. 94% of our    revenues are derived from the operations of California Water    Service Company. As a result, we are dependent on cash flow from    our subsidiaries, and California Water Service Company in    particular, to meet our obligations and to pay dividends on our    common stock.     We can make dividend payments only from our surplus (the excess,    if any, of our net assets over total paid-in capital) or if    there is no surplus, the net profits for the current fiscal year    or the fiscal year before which the dividend is declared. In    addition, we can pay cash dividends only if after paying those    dividends we would be able to pay our liabilities as they become    due. Owners of our capital stock cannot force us to pay    dividends and dividends will only be paid if and when declared    by our board of directors. Our board of directors can elect at    any time, and for an indefinite duration, not to declare    dividends on our capital stock.     Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and    generally have no obligation to pay any amounts due on    California Water Service Groups debt or to provide    California Water Service Group with funds for dividends.    Although there are no contractual or regulatory restrictions on    the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us, the    reasonableness of our capital structure is one of the factors    considered by state and local regulatory agencies in their    ratemaking determinations. Therefore, transfer of funds from our    subsidiaries to us for the payment of our obligations or    dividends may have an adverse effect on ratemaking    determinations. Furthermore, our right to receive cash or other    assets upon the liquidation or reorganization of a subsidiary is    generally subject to the prior claims of creditors of that    subsidiary. If we are unable to obtain funds from our    subsidiaries in a timely manner, we may be unable to meet our    obligations or pay dividends.    25Table of ContentsAn    important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition of    water and wastewater system, including operating agreements.    Risks associated with potential acquisitions, divestitures or    restructurings may adversely affect us.     We may seek to acquire or invest in other companies,    technologies, services or products that complement our business.    The execution of our growth strategy may expose us to different    risks than those associated with our utility operations. We can    give no assurance that we will succeed in finding attractive    acquisition candidates or investments, or that we would be able    to reach mutually agreeable terms with such parties. In    addition, as consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water    and wastewater industries, the prices for suitable acquisition    candidates may increase to unacceptable levels and limit our    ability to grow through acquisitions. If we are unable to find    acquisition candidates or investments, our ability to grow may    be limited.     Acquisition and investment transactions may result in the    issuance of our equity securities that could be dilutive if the    acquisition or business opportunity does not develop in    accordance with our business plan. They may also result in    significant write-offs and an increase in our debt. The    occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse    effect on our business, financial condition and results of    operations.     Any of these transactions could involve numerous additional    risks, including one or more of the following:           problems integrating the acquired operations, personnel,    technologies or products with our existing businesses and    products;           liabilities inherited from the acquired companies prior    business operations;           diversion of management time and attention from our core    business to the acquired business;           failure to retain key technical, management, sales and other    personnel of the acquired business;           difficulty in retaining relationships with suppliers and    customers of the acquired business; and           difficulty in getting required regulatory approvals.     In addition, the businesses and other assets we acquire may not    achieve the sales and profitability expected. The occurrence of    one or more of these events may have a material adverse effect    on our business. There can be no assurance that we will be    successful in overcoming these or any other significant risks    encountered. We may    not be able to increase or sustain our recent growth rate, and    we may not be able to manage our future growth    effectively.     We may be unable to continue to expand our business or manage    future growth. To successfully manage our growth and handle the    responsibilities of being a public company, we believe we must    effectively:           hire, train, integrate and manage additional qualified engineers    for engineering design and construction activities, new business    personnel, and financial and information technology personnel;           retain key management, augment our management team, and retain    qualified and certified water and wastewater system operators;           implement and improve additional and existing administrative,    financial and operations systems, procedures and controls;           expand and upgrade our technological capabilities; and           manage multiple relationships with our customers, regulators,    suppliers and other third parties.     If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be    able to take advantage of market opportunities, satisfy customer    requirements, execute our business plan or respond to    competitive pressures.    26Table of ContentsWe    have a number of large-volume commercial and industrial    customers and a significant decrease in consumption by one or    more of these customers could have an adverse effect on our    operating results and cash flows.     Our billed revenues will decrease, and such decrease may be    material, if a significant business or industrial customer    terminates or materially reduces its use of our water.    Approximately $111.7 million, or 24% of our 2010 water    utility revenues was derived from business and industrial    customers. If any of our large business or industrial customers    in California reduce or cease its consumption of our water, the    impact to net operating income would be minimal to our    operations due to the WRAM and MCBA, but could impact our cash    flows. In Hawaii, we serve a number of large resorts which if    their water usage was reduced or ceased could have a material    impact to our Hawaii operation. The delay between such date and    the effective date of the rate relief may be significant and    could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows. Our    operating cost and costs of providing services may rise faster    than our revenues.     Our ability to increase rates over time is dependent upon    approval of such rate increases by state commissions, or in the    case of the City of Hawthorne and the City of Commerce, the City    Council, which may be inclined, for political or other reasons,    to limit rate increases. However, our costs are subject to    market conditions and other factors, which may increase    significantly. The second largest component of our operating    costs after water production is made up of salaries and wages.    These costs are affected by the local supply and demand for    qualified labor. Other large components of our costs are general    insurance, workers compensation insurance, employee benefits and    health insurance costs. These costs may increase    disproportionately to rate increases authorized by state    commissions and may have a material adverse effect on our future    results of operations. Our    non-regulated business operates in a competitive    market.     While a majority of our business is regulated, our non-regulated    business participates in a competitive market. We compete with    several larger companies whose size, financial resources,    customer base and technical expertise may restrict our ability    to compete successfully for certain operations and maintenance    contracts. Due to the nature of our contract operations    business, and to the very competitive nature of the market, we    must accurately estimate the cost and profitability of each    project while, at the same time, maintaining prices at a level    low enough to compete with other companies. Our inability to    achieve this balance could adversely impact our results of    operations. Demand    for our stock may fluctuate due to circumstances beyond our    control.     We believe that stockholders invest in public utility stocks, in    part, because they seek reliable dividend payments. If there is    an over-supply of stock of public utilities in the market    relative to demand by such investors, the trading price of our    securities could decrease. Additionally, if interest rates rise    above the dividend yield offered by our equity securities,    demand for our stock, and consequently its market price, may    also decrease. A decline in demand for our stock may have a    negative impact on our ability to finance capital projects. The    price of our common stock may be volatile and may be affected by    market conditions beyond our control.     The trading price of our common stock may fluctuate in the    future because of the volatility of the stock market and a    variety of other factors, many of which are beyond our control.    Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of    our common stock include: regulatory developments; general    economic conditions and trends; price and volume fluctuations in    the overall stock market from time to time; actual or    anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of    operations; actual or anticipated changes in the expectations of    investors or securities analysts; actual or anticipated    developments in our competitors businesses or the    competitive landscape generally; litigation involving us or our    industry; and major catastrophic events or sales of large blocks    of our stock.     Equity markets in general have recently experienced extreme    price and volume fluctuations. Such price and volume    fluctuations may continue to adversely affect the market price    of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our business or    operating results.    27Table of ContentsAdverse    investment returns and other factors may increase our pension    liability and pension funding requirements.     A substantial number of our employees are covered by a defined    benefit pension plan. At present, the pension plan is    underfunded because our projected pension benefit obligation    exceeds the aggregate fair value of plan assets. Under    applicable law, we are required to make cash contributions to    the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding levels    imposed by regulatory requirements. The amount of such required    cash contribution is based on an actuarial valuation of the    plan. The funded status of the plan can be affected by    investment returns on plan assets, discount rates, mortality    rates of plan participants, pension reform legislation and a    number of other factors. There can be no assurance that the    value of our pension plan assets will be sufficient to cover    future liabilities. Although we have made contributions to our    pension plan in recent years, it is possible that we could incur    a pension liability adjustment, or could be required to make    additional cash contributions to our pension plan, which would    reduce the cash available for business and other needs. Work    stoppages and other labor relations matters could adversely    affect our operating results.     At December 31, 2010, 702 of our 1,127 total employees were    union employees. Most of our unionized employees are represented    by the Utility Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO, except certain    engineering and laboratory employees who are represented by the    International Federation of Professional and Technical    Engineers, AFL-CIO.     We believe our labor relations are good, but in light of rising    costs for healthcare and pensions, contract negotiations in the    future may be difficult. Furthermore, changes in applicable law    or regulations could have an adverse effect on managements    negotiating position with respect to our currently unionized    employees    and/or    employees that decide to unionize in the future. We are subject    to a risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters as    we negotiate with the unions to address these issues, which    could affect our results of operations and financial condition.    We can give no assurance that issues with our labor forces will    be resolved favorably to us in the future or that we will not    experience work stoppages. We    depend significantly on the services of the members of our    management team, and the departure of any of those persons could    cause our operating results to suffer.     Our success depends significantly on the continued individual    and collective contributions of our management team. The loss of    the services of any member of our management team could have a    material adverse effect on our business as our management team    has knowledge of our industry and customers and would be    difficult to replace. Our    operations are geographically concentrated in California and    this lack of diversification may negatively impact our    operations.     Although we own facilities in a number of states, over 94% of    our operations are located in California. As a result, we are    largely subject to weather, political, water supply, labor,    utility cost, regulatory and economic risks affecting California.     We are also affected by the real property market in California.    In order to grow our business, we may need to acquire additional    real estate or rights to use real property owned by third    parties, the cost of which tends to be higher and more volatile    in California relative to other states. The value of our assets    in California may decline if there is a decline in the    California real estate market which results in a significant    decrease in real property values.     In 2008 and 2009, we experienced higher than normal    uncollectible accounts activity which, we believe, were    attributable in part to the significant declines in real estate    values and rising unemployment experienced by our customers in a    number of our districts in California due to the economic    recession. In 2011, we may experience higher than normal    uncollectible accounts activity if real estate values continue    to decline and unemployment rates continue to increase.    28Table of ContentsThe    effects of natural disasters, terrorist activity, pandemics, or    poor water quality or contamination to our water supply may    result in disruption in our services and litigation which could    adversely affect our business, operating results and financial    condition.     We operate in areas that are prone to earthquakes, fires,    mudslides and other natural disasters. A significant seismic    event or other natural disaster in California where our    operations are concentrated, could adversely impact our ability    to deliver water and adversely affect our costs of operations. A    major disaster could damage or destroy substantial capital    assets. The California Public Utilities Commission has    historically allowed utilities to establish a catastrophic event    memorandum account as another possible mechanism to recover    costs. However, we can give no assurance that the CPUC or any    other commission would allow any such cost recovery mechanism in    the future.     Our water supplies are subject to contamination, including    contamination from the development of naturally-occurring    compounds, chemicals in groundwater systems, pollution resulting    from man-made sources, such as MTBE, sea water incursion and    possible terrorist attacks. If our water supply is contaminated,    we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we    are able to substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated    water source. In addition, we may incur significant costs in    order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our    current treatment facilities, or development of new treatment    methods. If we are unable to substitute water supply from an    uncontaminated water source, or to adequately treat the    contaminated water source in a cost-effective manner, there may    be an adverse effect on our revenues, operating results and    financial condition. The costs we incur to decontaminate a water    source or an underground water system could be significant and    could adversely affect our business, operating results and    financial condition and may not be recoverable in rates. We    could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human    exposure to hazardous substances in our water supplies or other    environmental damage. For example, private plaintiffs have the    right to bring personal injury or other toxic tort claims    arising from the presence of hazardous substances in our    drinking water supplies. Our insurance policies may not be    sufficient to cover the costs of these claims.     We operate a dam. If the dam were to fail for any reason, we    would lose a water supply and flooding likely would occur.    Whether or not we were responsible for the dams failure,    we could be sued. We can give no assurance that we would be able    to successfully defend such a suit.     In light of the threats to the nations health and security    ensuing in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist    attacks, we have taken steps to increase security measures at    our facilities and heighten employee awareness of threats to our    water supply. We have also tightened our security measures    regarding the delivery and handling of certain chemicals used in    our business. We have and will continue to bear increased costs    for security precautions to protect our facilities, operations    and supplies. These costs may be significant. Despite these    tightened security measures, we may not be in a position to    control the outcome of terrorist events should they occur.     We depend upon our skilled and trained workforce to ensure water    delivery. Were a pandemic to occur, we can give no assurance    that we would be able to maintain sufficient manpower to ensure    uninterrupted service in all of the districts that we serve. We    retain certain risks not covered by our insurance    policies.      We evaluate our risks and insurance coverage annually. Our    evaluation considers the costs, risks and benefits of retaining    versus insuring various risks as well as the availability of    certain types of insurance coverage. In addition, portions of    our business are difficult or impracticable to insure.    Furthermore, we are also affected by increases in prices for    insurance coverage; in particular, we have been, and will    continue to be, affected by rising health insurance costs.    Retained risks are associated with deductible limits, partial    self-insurance programs and insurance policy coverage ceilings.    If we suffer an uninsured loss, we may be unable to pass all, or    any portion, of the loss on to customers because our rates are    regulated by regulatory commissions. Consequently, uninsured    losses may negatively affect our financial condition, liquidity    and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we    will not face uninsured losses pertaining to the risks we have    retained.    29Table of ContentsWe    rely on our information technology and a number of complex    business systems that could malfunction and result in negative    impacts on our profitability and cash flow.     Our business is dependent on several complex business systems,    certain of which are owned by third parties. The business    systems must function reliably in order for us to operate    effectively. Among other things, system malfunctions and    security breaches could prevent us from operating or monitoring    our facilities, billing accurately and timely analysis of    financial results. Our profitability and cash flow could be    affected negatively in the event these systems do not operate    effectively or are circumvented. The    accuracy of our judgments and estimates about financial and    accounting matters will impact our operating results and    financial condition.     We make certain estimates and judgments in preparing our    financial statements regarding, among others:           the useful life of intangible rights;           the number of years to depreciate certain assets;           amounts to set aside for uncollectible accounts receivable,    inventory obsolesces and uninsured losses;           our legal exposure and the appropriate accrual for claims,    including medical claims and workers compensation claims;           future costs and assumptions for pensions and other    post-retirement benefits; and           possible tax uncertainties.     The quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments will    have an impact on our operating results and financial condition.     In addition, we must estimate unbilled revenues and costs as of    the end of each accounting period. If our estimates are not    accurate, we will be required to make an adjustment in a future    period. Accounting rules permit us to use expense balancing    accounts and memorandum accounts that include input cost changes    to us that are different from amounts incorporated into the    rates approved by the commissions. These accounts result in    expenses and revenues being recognized in periods other than in    which they occurred. Our    controls and procedures may fail or be    circumvented.     Management regularly reviews and updates our internal control    over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures,    and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of    controls and procedures, however well designed and operated, is    based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only    reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the    system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and    procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to    controls and procedures could result in lack of compliance with    contractual agreements, misstatements in our financial    statements in amounts that could be material or could cause    investors to lose confidence in our reported financial    information, either of which could have a negative effect on the    trading price of our stock and may negatively affect our ability    to raise future capital.     Further, if we or our independent registered public accounting    firm discover a material weakness in our internal control over    financial reporting, the disclosure of that fact, even if    quickly remedied, could reduce the markets confidence in    our financial statements and harm our stock price. In addition,    non-compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act    of 2002 could subject us to a variety of administrative    sanctions, including the suspension or delisting of our common    stock from the New York Stock Exchange and the inability of    registered broker-dealers to make a market in our common stock,    which would further reduce our stock price.    30Table of ContentsWe may    be required to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards    (IFRS), or other accounting or financial reporting standards,    the ultimate adoption of which could negatively impact our    business, financial condition or results of    operations.     We could be required to adopt IFRS or other accounting or    financial reporting standards different from Generally Accepted    Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the United States of America,    which is currently applicable to our accounting and financial    reporting. In 2008 the SEC released a proposed roadmap for the    adoption of IFRS according to which we could be required to    adopt IFRS in the future. Under GAAP we are subject to the    accounting procedures for accounting for the effects of certain    types of regulation, which, among other things, allows us to    defer certain costs if we believe it is probable that we will be    allowed to recover those costs by future rate increases.    Currently, IFRS does not contain provisions equivalent to the    current GAAP accounting procedures. The implementation and    adoption of new accounting or financial reporting standards    could affect our reported performance, which in turn could    favorably or unfavorably impact our business, financial    condition or results of operations. Furthermore, the transition    to and application of new accounting or financial reporting    standards could result in increased administrative costs. The    SEC is expected to make a final determination regarding the    adoption of IFRS in 2011. Municipalities,    water districts and other public agencies may condemn our    property by eminent domain action.     State statutes allow municipalities, water districts and other    public agencies to own and operate water systems. These agencies    are empowered to condemn properties already operated by    privately owned public utilities. However, whenever a public    agency constructs facilities to extend a utility system into the    service area of a privately owned public utility, such an act    constitutes the taking of property and requires reimbursement to    the utility for its loss. If a public agency were to acquire our    utility property by eminent domain action, we would be entitled    to just compensation for our loss, but we would no longer have    access to the condemned property nor would we be entitled to any    portion of revenue generated from the use of such asset going    forward. Some    anti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of    incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law,    could impair a takeover attempt.     We have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and    bylaws, each of which could have the effect of rendering more    difficult or discouraging an acquisition of the Company deemed    undesirable by our Board of Directors. These include provisions:           authorizing blank check preferred stock, which the Company could    issue with voting, liquidation, dividend, and other rights    superior to our common stock.           limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, the    Companys directors and officers;           specifying that the Companys stockholders may take action    only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders    and otherwise in accordance with our bylaws and limiting the    ability of our stockholders to call special meetings;           requiring advance notice of proposals by the Companys    stockholders for business to be conducted at stockholder    meetings and for nominations of candidates for election to our    Board of Directors; and           controlling the procedures for conduct of Board and stockholder    meetings and election, appointment and removal of directors.     These provisions, alone or together, could deter or delay    hostile takeovers, proxy contests and changes in control or    management of the Company. As a Delaware corporation, we are    also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including    Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which    prevents some stockholders from engaging in certain business    combinations without approval of the holders of substantially    all of our outstanding common stock.     Any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or    Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a    change in control of the Company could limit the opportunity for    our stockholders to receive a premium    31Table of Contents    for their shares of our common stock and also could affect the    price that some investors are willing to pay for our common    stock. "
7,CWT,CALIFORNIA WATER SERVICE GP,2010-03-01,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors.     The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only    ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that    management is not aware of or focused on or that management    currently deems immaterial may also impair our business    operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our    financial condition and results of operations could be    materially and adversely affected. Risks    Related to Our Regulatory Environment Our    business is heavily regulated by state and federal regulatory    agencies and our financial viability depends upon our ability to    recover costs from our customers through rates that must be    approved by state public utility commissions.     California Water Service Company, New Mexico Water Service    Company, Washington Water Service Company and Hawaii Water    Service Company, Inc., are regulated public utilities which    provide water service to our customers. The rates that we charge    our water customers are subject to the jurisdiction of the    regulatory commissions in the states in which we operate. These    commissions set water rates for each operating district    independently because the systems are not interconnected. The    commissions authorize us to charge rates which they consider to    be sufficient to recover normal operating expenses, to provide    funds for adding new or replacing water infrastructure, and to    allow us to earn what the commissions consider to be a fair and    reasonable return on invested capital.     Our revenues and consequently our ability to meet our financial    objectives are dependent upon the rates we are authorized to    charge our customers by the commissions and our ability to    recover our costs in these rates. Our management uses forecasts,    models and estimates in order to set rates that will provide a    fair and reasonable return on our invested capital. While our    rates must be approved by the commissions, no assurance can be    given that our forecasts, models and estimates will be correct    or that the commissions will agree with our forecasts, models    and estimates. If our rates are set too low, our revenues may be    insufficient to cover our operating expenses, capital    expenditure requirements and desired dividend levels.     We periodically file rate increase applications with the    commissions. The ensuing administrative and hearing process may    be lengthy and costly. The decisions of the commissions are    beyond our control and we can provide no assurances that our    rate increase requests will be granted by the commissions. Even    if approved, there is no guarantee that approval will be given    in a timely manner or at a sufficient level to cover our    expenses and provide a reasonable return on our investment. If    the rate increase decisions are delayed, our earnings may be    adversely affected. Our    evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets    is subject to adjustment by regulatory agencies and any such    adjustment could adversely affect our results of    operations.     Regulatory decisions may also impact prospective revenues and    earnings, affect the timing of the recognition of revenues and    expenses and may overturn past decisions used in determining our    revenues and expenses. Our management continually evaluates the    anticipated recovery of regulatory assets, liabilities, and    revenues subject to refund and provides for allowances    and/or    reserves as deemed necessary. Current accounting procedures    allow us to defer certain costs if we believe it is probable    that we will be allowed to recover those costs by future rate    increases. If a commission determined that a portion of our    assets were not recoverable in customer rates, we may suffer an    asset impairment which would require a write down in such    assets valuation which would be recorded through    operations.     If our assessment as to the probability of recovery through the    ratemaking process is incorrect, the associated regulatory asset    or liability would be adjusted to reflect the change in our    assessment or any regulatory    17Table of Contents    disallowances. A change in our evaluation of the probability of    recovery of regulatory assets or a regulatory disallowance of    all or a portion of our cost could have a material adverse    effect on our financial results. Regulatory    agencies may disagree with our valuation and characterization of    certain of our assets.     If we determine that assets are no longer used or useful for    utility operations, we may remove them from our rate base and    subsequently sell those assets. If the commission disagrees with    our characterization, we could be subjected to penalties.    Furthermore, there is a risk that the commission could determine    that appreciation in property value should be awarded to the    ratepayers rather than our stockholders. Changes    in laws, rules and policies of regulatory agencies can    significantly affect our business.     Regulatory agencies may change their rules and policies for    various reasons, including changes in the local political    environment. In some states, regulators are elected by popular    vote or are appointed by elected officials, and the results of    elections may change the long-established rules and policies of    an agency dramatically. For example, in 2001 regulation    regarding recovery of increases in electrical rates changed in    California. For over 20 years prior to 2001, the California    Public Utilities Commission allowed recovery of electric rate    increases under its operating rules. However, in 2003, the    commission reinstated its policy to allow utilities to adjust    their rates for rate changes by the power companies. The    original decision by the commission to change its policy, as    well as its subsequent decision to reinstate that policy,    affected our business.     We rely on policies and regulations promulgated by the various    state commissions in order to recover capital expenditures,    maintain favorable treatment on gains from the sale of real    property, offset certain production and operating costs, recover    the cost of debt, maintain an optimal equity structure without    over-leveraging, and have financial and operational flexibility    to engage in non-regulated operations. If any of the commissions    with jurisdiction over us implement policies and regulations    that do not allow us to accomplish some or all of the items    listed above, our future operating results may be adversely    affected.     In addition, legislatures may repeal, relax or tighten existing    laws, or enact new laws that impact the regulatory agencies with    jurisdiction over our business or affect our business directly.    If changes in existing laws or the implementation of new laws    limit our ability to accomplish some or all of our business    objectives, our future operating results may be adversely    affected. We    expect environmental regulation to increase, resulting in higher    operating costs in the future.     Our water and wastewater services are governed by various    federal and state environmental protection, health and safety    laws, and regulations. These provisions establish criteria for    drinking water and for discharges of water, wastewater and    airborne substances. The Environmental Protection Agency    promulgates numerous nationally applicable standards, including    maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for drinking water. We believe    we are currently in compliance with all of the MCLs promulgated    to date but we can give no assurance that we will continue to    comply with all water quality requirements. If we violate any    federal or state regulations or laws governing health and    safety, we could be subject to substantial fines or otherwise    sanctioned.     Environmental laws are complex and change frequently. They tend    to become more stringent over time. As new or stricter standards    are introduced, they could increase our operating costs.    Although we would likely seek permission to recover these costs    through rate increases, we can give no assurance that the    commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover    these additional compliance costs.     We are required to test our water quality for certain chemicals    and potential contaminants on a regular basis. If the test    results indicate that we exceed allowable limits, we may be    required either to commence treatment to remove the contaminant    or to develop an alternate water source. Either of these results    may be costly, and there can be no assurance that the    commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover    these additional compliance costs.    18Table of ContentsLegislation    regarding climate change may impact our operations     Future legislation regarding climate change may restrict our    operations or impose new costs on our business. Our operations    depend on power provided by other public utilities and, in    emergencies, power generated by our portable and fixed    generators. If future legislation limits emissions from the    power generation process, our cost of power may increase. Any    increase in the cost of power will be passed along to our    California rate payers through the MCBA or included in our cost    of service paid by our rate payers as requested in our general    rate case filings. While recovery of these costs are not    guaranteed, we would expect recovery in the regulatory process.     Approved in April 2009, the Low Carbon Fuel Standard Program,    which will go in to effect January 1, 2011, will require    diesel engines to use low carbon fuel such as biodiesel or other    alternatives. This may increase the operating cost of our    generators and vehicles.     We maintain a fleet of vehicles to provide service to our    customers, including a number of heavy duty diesel vehicles that    will be required to be retrofitted by the end of 2010 to meet    California emission standards. If future legislation further    impacts the cost to operate the fleet or the fleet acquisition    cost in order to meet certain emission standards, it will    increase our cost of service and our rate base. Any increase in    fleet operating costs associated with meeting emission standards    will be included in our cost of service paid by our rate payers    as requested in our general rate case filings. While recovery of    these costs are not guaranteed, we would expect recovery in the    regulatory process.     Starting January 1, 2010, under the California    Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), all capital projects of a    certain type (primarily wells, tanks, major pipelines and    treatment facilities) will require mitigation of green house gas    emissions. The cost to prepare the CEQA documentation and permit    will add an estimated ten thousand dollars to such capital    projects. This cost will be included in our capital cost and    added to our rate base, which will be requested to be paid for    by our rate payers. Any increase in the operating cost of the    facilities will also be included in our cost of service paid by    our rate payers as requested in our general rate case filings.    While recovery of these costs are not guaranteed, we would    expect recovery in the regulatory process.     Proposed cap and trade regulations are scheduled to be approved    in late 2010 and implemented in 2012 with the goal of reducing    emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020. Under such    regulations, if approved, we will be required to determine our    carbon footprint and evaluate our electricity and fuel usage    (both diesel and gasoline). We will also be required to evaluate    methane emissions from our primary processes in our wastewater    plants. At this time we are unable to determine the cost impact    of such regulations but any increase in operating costs    associated with the cap and trade regulations will be included    in our cost of service requested to be paid by our rate payers    as requested in our general rate case filings. While recovery of    these costs are not guaranteed, we would expect recovery in the    regulatory process. We are    party to a toxic contamination lawsuit which could result in our    paying damages not covered by insurance.     In 1995, the State of Californias Department of Toxic    Substances Control (DTSC) named us as a potential responsible    party for cleanup of a toxic contamination plume in the Chico    groundwater. In December 2002, we were named along with other    defendants in two lawsuits filed by DTSC for the cleanup of the    plumes. The toxic spill occurred when cleaning solvents, which    were discharged into the citys sewer system by local dry    cleaners, leaked into the underground water supply. The DTSC    contends that our responsibility stems from our operation of    wells in the surrounding vicinity that caused the contamination    plumes to spread. While we are cooperating with the clean up, we    deny any responsibility for the contamination or the resulting    cleanup.     In 2007, the Company entered into Court approved consent decrees    (Consent Decrees). The Consent Decrees conditioned the    Companys performance upon many factors, including, but not    limited to, water pumped and treated by the Company must meet    regulatory standards so the Company may distribute to its    customers. Pursuant to the terms of the Consent Decrees, the    Company will incur capital costs of $1.5 million and future    operating costs with a present value of approximately    $2.6 million. In its 2007 general rate case (GRC)    settlement negotiations, Division of Ratepayer Advocates agreed    to track all costs associated with the Consent Decrees including    legal costs to pursue insurance coverage for potential future    recovery in rates.    19Table of Contents    In connection with these suits, our insurance carrier, Employers    Insurance of Wausau (Wausau) filed a separate lawsuit against us    for reimbursement of past defense costs, which approximate    $1.5 million, and a declaratory determination of coverage.    On January 23, 2008, the Court heard various parties    motions and on September 25, 2008 issued its rulings that    Wausau had a duty to defend; therefore, the Company will not    have to reimburse Wausau for previously incurred defense costs.    The Court did not find Wausaus actions were intended to    harm the Company so the Company will not be able to recover    punitive damages. However, the Court also found that the issue    of policy coverage would be determined at trial. Trial commenced    on June 1, 2009. During trial, the parties entered into a    confidential settlement agreement. which did not have a    significant impact on the Companys results of operations.    The confidential settlement was fully executed on June 23,    2009 and the lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice by the court    during the month of October 2009.     The number of environmental and product-related lawsuits against    other water utilities have increased in frequency in recent    years. If we are subject to additional environmental or    product-related lawsuits, we might incur significant legal costs    and it is uncertain whether we would be able to recover the    legal costs from ratepayers or other third parties. In addition,    if current California law regarding California Public Utilities    Commissions preemptive jurisdiction over regulated public    utilities for claims about compliance with California Department    of Health Services and United States Environmental Protection    Agency water quality standards changes, our legal exposure may    be significantly increased. Risks    Related to Our Business Operations Wastewater    operations entail significant risks.     While wastewater collection and treatment is not presently a    major component of our revenues, wastewater collection and    treatment involve many risks associated with damage to the    surrounding environment. If collection or treatment systems fail    or do not operate properly, untreated or partially treated    wastewater could discharge onto property or into nearby streams    and rivers, causing property damage or injury to aquatic life,    or even human life. Liabilities resulting from such damage could    materially and adversely affect our results of operations and    financial condition. Demand    for our water is subject to various factors and is affected by    seasonal fluctuations.     Demand for our water during the warmer, dry months is generally    greater than during cooler or rainy months due primarily to    additional requirements for water in connection with irrigation    systems, swimming pools, cooling systems and other outside water    use. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically    warmer months, demand will vary with temperature and rainfall    levels. If temperatures during the typically warmer months are    cooler than normal, or if there is more rainfall than normal,    the demand for our water may decrease.     In addition, governmental restrictions on water usage during    drought conditions may result in a decreased demand for our    water, even if our water reserves are sufficient to serve our    customers during these drought conditions. However, during the    drought of the late 1980s and early 1990s the    California Public Utilities Commission beginning in 1992 allowed    us to surcharge our customers to collect lost revenues caused by    customers conservation during the drought. Regardless of    whether we may surcharge our customers during a conservation    period, they may use less water even after a drought has passed    because of conservation patterns developed during the drought.    Furthermore, our customers may wish to use recycled water as a    substitute for potable water. If rights are granted to others to    serve our customers recycled water, there will likely be a    decrease in demand for our water. The    adequacy of our water supplies depends upon a variety of factors    beyond our control. Interruption in the water supply may    adversely affect our earnings.     We depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and    future needs of our customers. Whether we have an adequate    supply varies depending upon a variety of factors, many of which    are partially or completely beyond our control, including:           the amount of rainfall;           the amount of water stored in reservoirs;    20Table of Contents           underground water supply from which well water is pumped;           changes in the amount of water used by our customers;           water quality;           legal limitations on water use such as rationing restrictions    during a drought; and           population growth.     We purchase our water supply from various governmental agencies    and others. Water supply availability may be affected by weather    conditions, funding and other political and environmental    considerations. In addition, our ability to use surface water is    subject to regulations regarding water quality and volume    limitations. If new regulations are imposed or existing    regulations are changed or given new interpretations, the    availability of surface water may be materially reduced. A    reduction in surface water could result in the need to procure    more costly water from other sources, thereby increasing our    water production costs and adversely affecting our operating    results.     We have entered into long-term agreements, which commit us to    payments whether or not we purchase any water. Therefore, if    demand is insufficient to use our required purchases we would    have to pay for water we did not receive.     From time to time, we enter into water supply contracts with    third parties and our business is dependent upon such agreements    in order to meet regional demand. For example, we have entered    into a water supply contract with the San Francisco Public    Utilities Commission which we rely upon. We can give no    assurance that the San Francisco Public Utilities    Commission, or any of the other parties from whom we purchase    water, will renew our contracts upon expiration, or that we will    not be subject to significant price increases under any such    renewed contracts.     The parties from whom we purchase water maintain significant    infrastructure and systems to deliver water to us. Maintenance    of these facilities is beyond our control. If these facilities    are not adequately maintained or if these parties otherwise    default on their obligations to supply water to us, we may not    have adequate water supplies to meet our customers needs.     If we are unable to access adequate water supplies we may be    unable to satisfy all customer demand which could result in    rationing. Rationing may have an adverse effect on cash flow    from operations. We can make no guarantee that we will always    have access to an adequate supply of water that will meet all    required quality standards. Water shortages may affect us in a    variety of ways. For example, shortages could:           adversely affect our supply mix by causing us to rely on more    expensive purchased water;           adversely affect operating costs;           increase the risk of contamination to our systems due to our    inability to maintain sufficient pressure; and           increase capital expenditures for building pipelines to connect    to alternative sources of supply, new wells to replace those    that are no longer in service or are otherwise inadequate to    meet the needs of our customers and reservoirs and other    facilities to conserve or reclaim water.     We may or may not be able to recover increased operating and    construction costs on a timely basis, or at all, for our    regulated systems through the ratemaking process. Although we    can give no assurance, we may also be able to recover certain of    these costs from third parties that may be responsible, or    potentially responsible, for groundwater contamination. Changes    in water supply costs impact our operations.     The cost to obtain water for delivery to our customers varies    depending on the sources of supply, wholesale suppliers    prices and the quantity of water produced to fulfill customer    water demand. Our source of supply varies among our operating    districts. Certain districts obtain all of their supply from    wells; some districts purchase all of the supply from wholesale    suppliers; and other districts obtain the supply from a    combination of wells and wholesale suppliers. A small portion of    supply comes from surface sources and is processed through    Company-owned water treatment plants. On average, slightly more    than half of the water we deliver to our customers is    21Table of Contents    pumped from wells or received from a surface supply with the    remainder purchased from wholesale suppliers. Water purchased    from suppliers usually costs us more than surface supplied or    well pumped water. During 2009, the cost of purchased water for    delivery to customers represented 31.2% of our total operating    costs and in 2008 it represented 31.7% of our total operating    costs.     Wholesale water suppliers may increase their prices for water    delivered to us based on factors that affect their operating    costs. Purchased water rate increases are beyond our control. In    California, effective July 1, 2008, our ability to recover    increases in the cost of purchased water changed with the    adoption of the MCBA. With this change actual purchased water    costs are compared to authorized purchased water costs with    variances, netted against variance in purchased power, pump tax,    and metered revenue, recorded to revenue. The balance in the    MCBA will be collected in the future. Though there may be a    short-term impact to cash flow from operations; the impact to    earnings have been minimized. Dependency    upon adequate supply of electricity and certain chemicals could    adversely affect our results of operations.     Purchased electrical power is required to operate the wells and    pumps needed to supply water to our customers. Although there    are back-up    power generators to operate a number of wells and pumps in    emergencies, an extended interruption in power could impact the    ability to supply water. In the past, California has been    subject to rolling power blackouts due to insufficient power    supplies. There is no assurance we will not be subject to power    blackouts in the future. Additionally, we require sufficient    amounts of certain chemicals in order to treat the water we    supply. There are multiple sources for these chemicals but an    extended interruption of supply could adversely affect our    ability to adequately treat our water.     Purchased power is a significant operating expense. During 2009    and 2008, purchased power expense represented 7.2% and 7.4% of    our total operating costs. These costs are beyond our control    and can change unpredictably and substantially as occurred in    California during 2001 when rates paid for electricity increased    48%. As with purchased water, purchased power costs are included    in the MCBA. Cash flows between rate filings may be adversely    affected until the commission authorizes a rate change but    earnings will be minimally impacted. Cost of chemicals used in    the delivery of water is not an element of the MCBA and    therefore variances in quantity or cost could impact the results    of operations. Our    ability to generate new operating contracts is affected by local    politics.     Our revenue growth depends upon our ability to generate new as    well as renew operating contracts with cities, other agencies    and municipal utility districts. As our services are sold in a    political environment, there is exposure to changing trends and    municipal preferences. Recent terrorist acts have affected some    political viewpoints relative to outsourcing of water or    wastewater utility services. Municipalities own and municipal    employees operate the majority of water and wastewater systems.    Significant marketing and sales efforts are spent demonstrating    the benefits of contract operations to elected officials and    municipal authorities. The existing political environment means    decisions are based on many factors, not just economic factors. Our    business requires significant capital expenditures that are    dependent on our ability to secure appropriate funding. If we    are unable to obtain sufficient capital or if the rates at which    we borrow increase, there would be a negative impact on our    results of operations.     The water utility business is capital-intensive. We invest    significant funds to add or replace property, plant and    equipment. In addition, water shortages may adversely affect us    by causing us to rely on more purchased water. This could cause    increases in capital expenditures needed to build pipelines to    secure alternative water sources. In addition, we require    capital to grow our business through acquisitions. We fund our    short-term capital requirements from cash received from    operations and funds received from developers. We also borrow    funds from banks under short-term bank lending arrangements. We    seek to meet our long-term capital needs by raising equity    through common or preferred stock issues or issuing debt    obligations. We cannot give any assurance that these sources    will continue to be adequate or that the cost of funds will    remain at levels permitting us to earn a reasonable rate of    22Table of Contents    return. In the event we are unable to obtain sufficient capital,    our expansion efforts could be curtailed, which may affect our    growth and may affect our future results of operations.     Our ability to access the capital markets is affected by the    ratings of certain of our debt securities. Standard &    Poors Rating Agency issues a rating on California Water    Service Companys ability to repay certain debt    obligations. The credit rating agency could downgrade our credit    rating based on reviews of our financial performance and    projections or upon the occurrence of other events that could    impact our business outlook. Standard & Poors    rating is A+ with a stable outlook. On April 8, 2009,    Standard & Poors issued a rating of AA- on the    5.875% $100 million First Mortgage bonds issued in April.    Lower ratings by the agency could restrict our ability to access    equity and debt capital. We can give no assurance that the    rating agency will maintain ratings which allow us to borrow    under advantageous conditions and at reasonable interest rates.    A future downgrade by the agency could also increase our cost of    capital by causing potential investors to require a higher    interest rate due to a perceived risk related to our ability to    repay outstanding debt obligations.     While the majority of our debt is long term at fixed rates, we    do have interest rate exposure in our short-term borrowings    which have variable interest rates. We are also subject to    interest rate risks on new financings. However, if interest    rates were to increase on a long-term basis, our management    believes that customer rates would increase accordingly, subject    to approval by the appropriate commission. We can give no    assurance that the commission would approve such an increase in    customer rates.     We are obligated to comply with specified debt covenants under    certain of our loan and debt agreements. Failure to maintain    compliance with these covenants could limit future borrowing,    and we could face increased borrowing costs, litigation,    acceleration of maturity schedules, and cross default issues.    Such actions by our creditors could have a material adverse    effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Adverse    changes to the national and world-wide financial system could    result in disruptions in the financial and real estate markets    availability and cost of short-term funds for our liquidity    requirements, our ability to meet long-term commitments, and our    customers ability to pay for water services. This could    adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and    financial condition.     We rely on our current credit facilities to fund short-term    liquidity needs if internal funds are not available from    operations. Specifically, given the seasonal fluctuations in    demand for our water we commonly draw on our credit facilities    to meet our cash requirements at times in the year when demand    is relatively low. We also may occasionally use letters of    credit issued under our revolving credit facilities. Disruptions    in the capital and credit markets or further deterioration in    the strength of financial institutions could adversely affect    our ability to draw on our credit facilities. Our access to    funds under our credit facilities is dependent on the ability of    our banks to meet its funding commitments.     Longer-term disruptions in the financial markets as a result of    uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced    capital-raising alternatives, or failures of significant    financial institutions or other factors could adversely affect    our access to liquidity. Any disruption could require us to take    measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until    alternative credit arrangements or other funding for business    needs can be arranged. Such measures could include deferring    capital expenditures, dividend payments or other discretionary    uses of cash.     Many of our customers and suppliers also have exposure to risks    that their ability to meet their payment and supply commitments    are adversely affected by the worldwide financial crisis and    recession in the United States and resulting potential    disruptions in the financial and real estate markets. We operate    in geographic areas that may be particularly susceptible to    declines in the price of real property and other consequences of    the financial crisis, which could result in significant declines    in demand for our products and services in certain of our    districts. In the event that any of our significant customers or    suppliers, or a significant number of smaller customers and    suppliers, are adversely affected by these risks, we may face    disruptions in supply, significant reductions in demand for our    products and services, inability of customers to pay invoices    when due, and other adverse effects that could negatively affect    our financial condition, results of operations    and/or cash    flows.     Our operations and certain contracts for water distribution and    treatment depend on the financial capability of state and local    governments, and other municipal entities such as water    districts. Major disruptions in the financial    23Table of Contents    strength or operations of such entities, such as liquidity    limitations, bankruptcy or insolvency, could have an adverse    effect on our ability to conduct our business    and/or    enforce our rights under contracts to which such entities are a    party. We are    a holding company that depends on cash flow from our    subsidiaries to meet our obligations and to pay dividends on our    common stock.     As a holding company, we conduct substantially all of our    operations through our subsidiaries and our only significant    assets are investments in those subsidiaries. 94% of our    revenues are derived from the operations of California Water    Service Company. As a result, we are dependent on cash flow from    our subsidiaries, and California Water Service Company in    particular, to meet our obligations and to pay dividends on our    common stock.     We can make dividend payments only from our surplus (the excess,    if any, of our net assets over total paid-in capital) or if    there is no surplus, the net profits for the current fiscal year    or the fiscal year before which the dividend is declared. In    addition, we can pay cash dividends only if after paying those    dividends we would be able to pay our liabilities as they become    due. Owners of our capital stock cannot force us to pay    dividends and dividends will only be paid if and when declared    by our board of directors. Our board of directors can elect at    any time, and for an indefinite duration, not to declare    dividends on our capital stock.     Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and    generally have no obligation to pay any amounts due on    California Water Service Groups debt or to provide    California Water Service Group with funds for dividends.    Although there are no contractual or regulatory restrictions on    the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us, the    reasonableness of our capital structure is one of the factors    considered by state and local regulatory agencies in their    ratemaking determinations. Therefore, transfer of funds from our    subsidiaries to us for the payment of our obligations or    dividends may have an adverse effect on ratemaking    determinations. Furthermore, our right to receive cash or other    assets upon the liquidation or reorganization of a subsidiary is    generally subject to the prior claims of creditors of that    subsidiary. If we are unable to obtain funds from our    subsidiaries in a timely manner we may be unable to meet our    obligations or pay dividends. An    important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition of    water and wastewater system, including operating agreements.    Risks associated with potential acquisitions, divestitures or    restructurings may adversely affect us.     We may seek to acquire or invest in other companies,    technologies, services or products that complement our business.    The execution of our growth strategy may expose us to different    risks than those associated with our utility operations. We can    give no assurance that we will succeed in finding attractive    acquisition candidates or investments, or that we would be able    to reach mutually agreeable terms with such parties. In    addition, as consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water    and wastewater industries, the prices for suitable acquisition    candidates may increase to unacceptable levels and limit our    ability to grow through acquisitions. If we are unable to find    acquisition candidates or investments, our ability to grow may    be limited.     Acquisition and investment transactions may result in the    issuance of our equity securities that could be dilutive if the    acquisition or business opportunity does not develop in    accordance with our business plan. They may also result in    significant write-offs and an increase in our debt. The    occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse    effect on our business, financial condition and results of    operations.     Any of these transactions could involve numerous additional    risks. For example, we may incur one or more of the following:           problems integrating the acquired operations, personnel,    technologies or products with our existing businesses and    products;           liabilities inherited from the acquired companies prior    business operations;           diversion of management time and attention from our core    business to the acquired business;           failure to retain key technical, management, sales and other    personnel of the acquired business;    24Table of Contents           difficulty in retaining relationships with suppliers and    customers of the acquired business; and           difficulty in getting required regulatory approvals.     In addition, the businesses and other assets we acquire may not    achieve the sales and profitability expected. The occurrence of    one or more of these events may have a material adverse effect    on our business. There can be no assurance that we will be    successful in overcoming these or any other significant risks    encountered. We may    not be able to increase or sustain our recent growth rate, and    we may not be able to manage our future growth    effectively.     We may be unable to continue to expand our business or manage    future growth. To successfully manage our growth and handle the    responsibilities of being a public company, we believe we must    effectively:           hire, train, integrate and manage additional qualified engineers    for research and development activities, sales and marketing    personnel, and financial and information technology personnel;           retain key management and augment our management team;           implement and improve additional and existing administrative,    financial and operations systems, procedures and controls;           expand and upgrade our technological capabilities; and           manage multiple relationships with our customers, regulators,    suppliers and other third parties.     If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be    able to take advantage of market opportunities, satisfy customer    requirements, execute our business plan or respond to    competitive pressures. We    have a number of large-volume commercial and industrial    customers and a significant decrease in consumption by one or    more of these customers could have an adverse effect on our    operating results and cash flows.     Our revenues will decrease, and such decrease may be material,    if a significant business or industrial customer terminates or    materially reduces its use of our water. Approximately    $105.7 million, or 24% of our 2009 water utility revenues    was derived from business and industrial customers. If any of    our large business or industrial customers reduces or ceases its    consumption of our water, we may seek commission approval to    increase the rates of our remaining customers to offset    decreased revenues. There can be no assurance, however, that the    commission would approve such a rate relief request, and even if    it did approve such a request, it would not apply retroactively    to the date of the reduction in consumption. The delay between    such date and the effective date of the rate relief may be    significant and could adversely affect our operating results and    cash flows. Our    operating cost and costs of providing services may rise faster    than our revenues.     Our ability to increase rates over time is dependent upon    approval of such rate increases by state commissions, or in the    case of the City of Hawthorne and the City of Commerce, the City    Council, which may be inclined, for political or other reasons,    to limit rate increases. However, our costs are subject to    market conditions and other factors, which may increase    significantly. The second largest component of our operating    costs after water production is made up of salaries and wages.    These costs are affected by the local supply and demand for    qualified labor. Other large components of our costs are general    insurance, workers compensation insurance, employee benefits and    health insurance costs. These costs may increase    disproportionately to rate increases authorized by state    commissions and may have a material adverse effect on our future    results of operations. Our    non-regulated business operates in a competitive    market.     While a majority of our business is regulated, our non-regulated    business participates in a competitive market. We compete with    several larger companies whose size, financial resources,    customer base and technical expertise may restrict our ability    to compete successfully for certain operations and maintenance    contracts. Due to the nature of our contract operations    business, and to the very competitive nature of the market, we    must accurately estimate    25Table of Contents    the cost and profitability of each project while, at the same    time, maintaining prices at a level low enough to compete with    other companies. Our inability to achieve this balance could    adversely impact our results of operations. Demand    for our stock may fluctuate due to circumstances beyond our    control.     We believe that stockholders invest in public utility stocks, in    part, because they seek reliable dividend payments. If there is    an over-supply of stock of public utilities in the market    relative to demand by such investors, the trading price of our    securities could decrease. Additionally, if interest rates rise    above the dividend yield offered by our equity securities,    demand for our stock, and consequently its market price, may    also decrease. The    price of our common stock may be volatile and may be affected by    market conditions beyond our control.     The trading price of our common stock may fluctuate in the    future because of the volatility of the stock market and a    variety of other factors, many of which are beyond our control.    Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of    our common stock include: regulatory developments; general    economic conditions and trends; price and volume fluctuations in    the overall stock market from time to time; actual or    anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of    operations; actual or anticipated changes in the expectations of    investors or securities analysts; actual or anticipated    developments in our competitors businesses or the    competitive landscape generally; litigation involving us or our    industry; major catastrophic events or sales of large blocks of    our stock.     Equity markets in general have recently experienced extreme    price and volume fluctuations. Such price and volume    fluctuations may continue to adversely affect the market price    of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our business or    operating results. Adverse    investment returns and other factors may increase our pension    liability and pension funding requirements.     A substantial number of our employees are covered by a defined    benefit pension plan. At present, the pension plan is    underfunded because our projected pension benefit obligation    exceeds the aggregate fair value of plan assets. Under    applicable law, we are required to make cash contributions to    the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding levels    imposed by regulatory requirements. The amount of such required    cash contribution is based on an actuarial valuation of the    plan. The funded status of the plan can be affected by    investment returns on plan assets, discount rates, mortality    rates of plan participants, pension reform legislation and a    number of other factors. There can be no assurance that the    value of our pension plan assets will be sufficient to cover    future liabilities. Although we have made contributions to our    pension plan in recent years, it is possible that we could incur    a pension liability adjustment, or could be required to make    additional cash contributions to our pension plan, which would    reduce the cash available for business and other needs. Work    stoppages and other labor relations matters could adversely    affect our operating results.     At December 31, 2009, 660 of our 1,013 total employees were    union employees. Most of our unionized employees are represented    by the Utility Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO, except certain    engineering and laboratory employees who are represented by the    International Federation of Professional and Technical    Engineers, AFL-CIO. In November 2009 we negotiated 2010 wage    increases with both unions of 1.0% and other changes to our    employee benefit plans, and wage increases of 3.0% in 2011.     We believe our labor relations are good, but in light of rising    costs for healthcare and pensions, contract negotiations in the    future may be difficult. Furthermore, changes in applicable law    or regulations could have an adverse effect on managements    negotiating position with respect to our currently unionized    employees    and/or    employees that decide to unionize in the future. We are subject    to a risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters as    we negotiate with the unions to address these issues, which    could affect our results of operations and financial condition.    We can give no assurance that issues with our labor forces will    be resolved favorably to us in the future or that we will not    experience work stoppages.    26Table of ContentsWe    depend significantly on the services of the members of our    management team, and the departure of any of those persons could    cause our operating results to suffer.     Our success depends significantly on the continued individual    and collective contributions of our management team. The loss of    the services of any member of our management team could have a    material adverse effect on our business as our management team    has knowledge of our industry and customers and would be    difficult to replace. Our    operations are geographically concentrated in California and    this lack of diversification may negatively impact our    operations.     Although we own facilities in a number of states, over 94% of    our operations are located in California. As a result, we are    largely subject to weather, political, water supply, labor,    utility cost, regulatory and economic risks affecting California.     We are also affected by the real property market in California.    In order to grow our business, we may need to acquire additional    real estate or rights to use real property owned by third    parties, the cost of which tends to be higher and more volatile    in California relative to other states. The value of our assets    in California may decline if there is a decline in the    California real estate market which results in a significant    decrease in real property values.     In 2007, 2008, and 2009 we experienced an increase in    uncollectible accounts which, we believe, were attributable in    part to the significant declines in real estate values and    rising unemployment due to the economic recession, experienced    by our customers in a number of our districts in California. In    2010 we may experience continued high levels of uncollectible    accounts until real estate values rise and unemployment rates    decline. The    effects of natural disasters, terrorist activity, pandemics, or    poor water quality or contamination to our water supply may    result in disruption in our services and litigation which could    adversely affect our business, operating results and financial    condition.     We operate in areas that are prone to earthquakes, fires,    mudslides and other natural disasters. A significant seismic    event in California, where our operations are concentrated, or    other natural disaster in California could adversely impact our    ability to deliver water and adversely affect our costs of    operations. A major disaster could damage or destroy substantial    capital assets. The California Public Utilities Commission has    historically allowed utilities to establish a catastrophic event    memorandum account as another possible mechanism to recover    costs. However, we can give no assurance that the CPUC or any    other commission would allow any such cost recovery mechanism in    the future.     Our water supplies are subject to contamination, including    contamination from the development of naturally-occurring    compounds, chemicals in groundwater systems, pollution resulting    from man-made sources, such as MTBE, sea water incursion and    possible terrorist attacks. If our water supply is contaminated,    we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we    are able to substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated    water source. In addition, we may incur significant costs in    order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our    current treatment facilities, or development of new treatment    methods. If we are unable to substitute water supply from an    uncontaminated water source, or to adequately treat the    contaminated water source in a cost-effective manner, there may    be an adverse effect on our revenues, operating results and    financial condition. The costs we incur to decontaminate a water    source or an underground water system could be significant and    could adversely affect our business, operating results and    financial condition and may not be recoverable in rates. We    could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human    exposure to hazardous substances in our water supplies or other    environmental damage. For example, private plaintiffs have the    right to bring personal injury or other toxic tort claims    arising from the presence of hazardous substances in our    drinking water supplies. Our insurance policies may not be    sufficient to cover the costs of these claims.     We operate a dam. If the dam were to fail for any reason, we    would lose a water supply and flooding likely would occur.    Whether or not we were responsible for the dams failure,    we could be sued. We can give no assurance that we would be able    to successfully defend such a suit.     In light of the threats to the nations health and security    ensuing in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist    attacks, we have taken steps to increase security measures at    our facilities and heighten employee awareness of    27Table of Contents    threats to our water supply. We have also tightened our security    measures regarding the delivery and handling of certain    chemicals used in our business. We have and will continue to    bear increased costs for security precautions to protect our    facilities, operations and supplies. These costs may be    significant. Despite these tightened security measures, we may    not be in a position to control the outcome of terrorist events    should they occur.     We depend upon our skilled and trained workforce to ensure water    delivery. Were a pandemic to occur, we can give no assurance    that we would be able to maintain sufficient manpower to ensure    uninterrupted service in all of the districts that we serve. We    retain certain risks not covered by our insurance    policies.     We evaluate our risks and insurance coverage annually. Our    evaluation considers the costs, risks and benefits of retaining    versus insuring various risks as well as the availability of    certain types of insurance coverage. In addition, portions of    our business are difficult or impracticable to insure.    Furthermore, we are also affected by increases in prices for    insurance coverage; in particular, we have been, and will    continue to be, affected by rising health insurance costs.    Retained risks are associated with deductible limits, partial    self-insurance programs and insurance policy coverage ceilings.    If we suffer an uninsured loss, we may be unable to pass all, or    any portion, of the loss on to customers because our rates are    regulated by regulatory commissions. Consequently, uninsured    losses may negatively affect our financial condition, liquidity    and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we    will not face uninsured losses pertaining to the risks we have    retained. We    rely on our information technology and a number of complex    business systems that could malfunction and result in negative    impacts on our profitability and cash flow.     Our business is dependent on several complex business systems,    certain of which are owned by third parties. The business    systems must function reliably in order for us to operate    effectively. Among other things, system malfunctions and    security breaches could prevent us from operating or monitoring    our facilities, billing accurately and timely analysis of    financial results. Our profitability and cash flow could be    affected negatively in the event these systems do not operate    effectively or are circumvented. The    accuracy of our judgments and estimates about financial and    accounting matters will impact our operating results and    financial condition.     We make certain estimates and judgments in preparing our    financial statements regarding, among others:           the useful life of intangible rights;           the number of years to depreciate certain assets;           amounts to set aside for uncollectible accounts receivable,    inventory obsolesces and uninsured losses;           our legal exposure and the appropriate accrual for claims,    including medical claims and workers compensation claims;           future costs for pensions and other post-retirement benefits; and           possible tax allowances.     The quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments will    have an impact on our operating results and financial condition.     In addition, we must estimate unbilled revenues and costs as of    the end of each accounting period. If our estimates are not    accurate, we will be required to make an adjustment in a future    period. Accounting rules permit us to use expense balancing    accounts and memorandum accounts that include input cost changes    to us that are different from amounts incorporated into the    rates approved by the commissions. These accounts result in    expenses and revenues being recognized in periods other than in    which they occurred.    28Table of ContentsOur    controls and procedures may fail or be    circumvented.     Management regularly reviews and updates our internal control    over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures,    and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of    controls and procedures, however well designed and operated, is    based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only    reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the    system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and    procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to    controls and procedures could result in lack of compliance with    contractual agreements, misstatements in our financial    statements in amounts that could be material or could cause    investors to lose confidence in our reported financial    information, either of which could have a negative effect on the    trading price of our stock and may negatively affect our ability    to raise future capital.     Further, if we or our independent registered public accounting    firm discover a material weakness in our internal control over    financial reporting, the disclosure of that fact, even if    quickly remedied, could reduce the markets confidence in    our financial statements and harm our stock price. In addition,    non-compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act    of 2002 could subject us to a variety of administrative    sanctions, including the suspension or delisting of our common    stock from the New York Stock Exchange and the inability of    registered broker-dealers to make a market in our common stock,    which would further reduce our stock price. We may    be required to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards    (IFRS), or other accounting or financial reporting standards,    the ultimate adoption of which could negatively impact our    business, financial condition or results of    operations.     We could be required to adopt IFRS or other accounting or    financial reporting standards different from Generally Accepted    Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the United States of America,    which is currently applicable to our accounting and financial    reporting. In 2008 the SEC released a timetable for the adoption    of IFRS according to which we could be required to adopt IFRS by    2016. Under GAAP we are subject to the accounting procedures for    accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation,    which, among other things, allows us to defer certain costs if    we believe it is probable that we will be allowed to recover    those costs by future rate increases. Currently, IFRS does not    contain provisions equivalent to the current GAAP accounting    procedures. The implementation and adoption of new accounting or    financial reporting standards could affect our reported    performance, which in turn could favorably or unfavorably impact    our business, financial condition or results of operations.    Furthermore, the transition to and application of new accounting    or financial reporting standards could result in increased    administrative costs. Municipalities,    water districts and other public agencies may condemn our    property by eminent domain action.     State statutes allow municipalities, water districts and other    public agencies to own and operate water systems. These agencies    are empowered to condemn properties already operated by    privately owned public utilities. However, whenever a public    agency constructs facilities to extend a utility system into the    service area of a privately owned public utility, such an act    constitutes the taking of property and requires reimbursement to    the utility for its loss. If a public agency were to acquire our    utility property by eminent domain action, we would be entitled    to just compensation for our loss, but we would no longer have    access to the condemned property nor would we be entitled to any    portion of revenue generated from the use of such asset going    forward. "
13,CWT,CALIFORNIA WATER SERVICE GP,2009-03-02,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors.     The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only    ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that    management is not aware of or focused on or that management    currently deems immaterial may also impair our business    operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our    financial condition and results of operations could be    materially and adversely affected. Risks    Related to Our Regulatory Environment Our    business is heavily regulated by state and federal regulatory    agencies and our financial viability depends upon our ability to    recover costs from our customers through rates that must be    approved by state public utility commissions.     California Water Service Company, New Mexico Water Service    Company, Washington Water Service Company and Hawaii Water    Service Company, Inc., are regulated public utilities which    provide water service to our customers. The rates that we charge    our water customers are subject to the jurisdiction of the    regulatory commissions in the states in which we operate. These    commissions set water rates for each operating district    independently because the systems are not interconnected. The    commissions authorize us to charge rates which they consider to    be sufficient to recover normal operating expenses, to provide    funds for adding new or replacing water infrastructure, and to    allow us to earn what the commissions consider to be a fair and    reasonable return on invested capital.     Our revenues and consequently our ability to meet our financial    objectives are dependent upon the rates we are authorized to    charge our customers by the commissions and our ability to    recover our costs in these rates. Our management uses forecasts,    models and estimates in order to set rates that will provide a    fair and reasonable return    13Table of Contents    on our invested capital. While our rates must be approved by the    commissions, no assurance can be given that our forecasts,    models and estimates will be correct or that the commissions    will agree with our forecasts, models and estimates. If our    rates are set too low, our revenues may be insufficient to cover    our operating expenses, capital expenditure requirements and    desired dividend levels.     We periodically file rate increase applications with the    commissions. The ensuing administrative and hearing process may    be lengthy and costly. The decisions of the commissions are    beyond our control and we can provide no assurances that our    rate increase requests will be granted by the commissions. Even    if approved, there is no guarantee that approval will be given    in a timely manner or at a sufficient level to cover our    expenses and provide a reasonable return on our investment. If    the rate increase decisions are delayed, our earnings may be    adversely affected. Our    evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets    is subject to adjustment by regulatory agencies and any such    adjustment could adversely affect our results of    operations.     Regulatory decisions may also impact prospective revenues and    earnings, affect the timing of the recognition of revenues and    expenses and may overturn past decisions used in determining our    revenues and expenses. Our management continually evaluates the    anticipated recovery of regulatory assets, liabilities, and    revenues subject to refund and provides for allowances    and/or    reserves as deemed necessary. Under Financial Accounting    Standard SFAS No. 71 (Accounting for the Effects of    Certain Types of Regulation), we can defer certain costs if we    believe it is probable that we will be allowed to recover those    costs by future rate increases. If a commission determined that    a portion of our assets were not recoverable in customer rates,    we may suffer an asset impairment which would require a write    down in such assets valuation which would be recorded    through operations.     If our assessment as to the probability of recovery through the    ratemaking process is incorrect, the associated regulatory asset    or liability would be adjusted to reflect the change in our    assessment or any regulatory disallowances. A change in our    evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets    or a regulatory disallowance of all or a portion of our cost    could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Regulatory    agencies may disagree with our valuation and characterization of    certain of our assets.     If we determine that assets are no longer used or useful for    utility operations, we may remove them from our rate base and    subsequently sell those assets. If the commission disagrees with    our characterization, we could be subjected to penalties.    Furthermore, there is a risk that the commission could determine    that appreciation in property value should be awarded to the    ratepayers rather than our stockholders. Changes    in laws, rules and policies of regulatory agencies can    significantly affect our business.     Regulatory agencies may change their rules and policies for    various reasons, including as a result of changes in the local    political environment. In some states, regulators are elected by    popular vote or are appointed by elected officials, and the    results of elections may change the rules and policies of an    agency. As a result of the political process, long-established    rules and policies of an agency can change dramatically. For    example, in 2001 regulation regarding recovery of increases in    electrical rates changed in California. For over 20 years    prior to 2001, the California Public Utilities Commission    allowed recovery of electric rate increases under its operating    rules. However, in 2003, the commission reinstated its policy to    allow utilities to adjust their rates for rate changes by the    power companies. The original decision by the commission to    change its policy, as well as its subsequent decision to    reinstate that policy, affected our business.     We rely on policies and regulations promulgated by the various    state commissions in order to recover capital expenditures,    maintain favorable treatment on gains from the sale of real    property, offset certain production and operating costs, recover    the cost of debt, maintain an optimal equity structure without    over-leveraging, and have financial and operational flexibility    to engage in non-regulated operations. If any of the commissions    with jurisdiction over us implement policies and regulations    that do not allow us to accomplish some or all of the items    listed above, our future operating results may be adversely    affected.    14Table of Contents    In addition, legislatures may repeal, relax or tighten existing    laws, or enact new laws that impact the regulatory agencies with    jurisdiction over our business or affect our business directly.    If changes in existing laws or the implementation of new laws    limit our ability to accomplish some or all of our business    objectives, our future operating results may be adversely    affected. We    expect environmental regulation to increase, resulting in higher    operating costs in the future.     Our water and wastewater services are governed by various    federal and state environmental protection and health and safety    laws and regulations. These provisions establish criteria for    drinking water and for discharges of water, wastewater and    airborne substances. The Environmental Protection Agency    promulgates numerous nationally applicable standards, including    maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for drinking water. We believe    we are currently in compliance with all of the MCLs promulgated    to date but we can give no assurance that we will continue to    comply with all water quality requirements. If we violate any    federal or state regulations or laws governing health and    safety, we could be subject to substantial fines or otherwise    sanctioned.     Environmental laws are complex and change frequently. They have    tended to become more stringent over time. As new or stricter    standards are introduced, they could increase our operating    costs. Although we would likely seek permission to recover these    costs through rate increases, we can give no assurance that the    commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover    these additional compliance costs.     We are required to test our water quality for certain chemicals    and potential contaminants on a regular basis. If the test    results indicate that we exceed allowable limits, we may be    required either to commence treatment to remove the contaminant    or to develop an alternate water source. Either of these results    may be costly, and there can be no assurance that the    commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover    these additional compliance costs. We are    party to a toxic contamination lawsuit which could result in our    paying damages not covered by insurance.     In 1995, the State of Californias Department of Toxic    Substances Control (DTSC) named us as a potential responsible    party for cleanup of a toxic contamination plume in the Chico    groundwater. In December 2002, we were named along with other    defendants in two lawsuits filed by DTSC for the cleanup of the    plumes. The toxic spill occurred when cleaning solvents, which    were discharged into the citys sewer system by local dry    cleaners, leaked into the underground water supply. The DTSC    contends that our responsibility stems from our operation of    wells in the surrounding vicinity that caused the contamination    plumes to spread. While we are cooperating with the clean up, we    deny any responsibility for the contamination or the resulting    cleanup.     In 2007, the Company entered into Court approved consent decrees    (Consent Decrees). The Consent Decrees conditioned the    Companys performance upon many factors, including, but not    limited to, water pumped and treated by the Company must meet    regulatory standards so the Company may distribute to its    customers. Pursuant to the terms of the Consent Decrees, the    Company will incur capital costs of $1.5 million and future    operating costs with a present value of approximately    $2.6 million. In its 2007 general rate case (GRC)    settlement negotiations, Division of Ratepayer Advocates have    tentatively agreed to track all costs associated with the    Consent Decrees including legal costs to pursue insurance    coverage for potential future recovery in rates.     In connection with these suits, our insurance carrier has filed    a separate lawsuit against us for reimbursement of past defense    costs which approximate $1.5 million. We believe that the    insurance carrier has a duty to defend and is not entitled to    any defense cost reimbursement. Furthermore, we believe that    insurance coverage exists for the Companys claims.    However, if our claim is ultimately found to be excludable under    insurance policies, we may have to pay damages. Although we    consider it probable that we will be able to recover amounts    paid for damages through rate increases, we can give no    assurance that we will be able to make such a recovery.     The number of environmental and product-related lawsuits against    other water utilities have increased in frequency in recent    years. If we are subject to additional environmental or    product-related lawsuits, we might incur significant legal costs    and it is uncertain whether we would be able to recover the    legal costs from ratepayers or other third parties. In addition,    if current California law regarding California Public Utilities    Commissions    15Table of Contents    preemptive jurisdiction over regulated public utilities for    claims about compliance with California Department of Health    Services and United States Environmental Protection Agency water    quality standards changes, our legal exposure may be    significantly increased. Risks    Related to Our Business Operations Wastewater    operations entail significant risks.     While wastewater collection and treatment is not presently a    major component of our revenues, wastewater collection and    treatment involve many risks associated with damage to the    surrounding environment. If collection or treatment systems fail    or do not operate properly, untreated or partially treated    wastewater could discharge onto property or into nearby streams    and rivers, causing property damage or injury to aquatic life,    or even human life. Liabilities resulting from such damage could    materially and adversely affect our results of operations and    financial condition. Demand    for our water is subject to various factors and is affected by    seasonal fluctuations.     Demand for our water during the warmer, dry months is generally    greater than during cooler or rainy months due primarily to    additional requirements for water in connection with irrigation    systems, swimming pools, cooling systems and other outside water    use. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically    warmer months, demand will vary with temperature and rainfall    levels. If temperatures during the typically warmer months are    cooler than normal, or if there is more rainfall than normal,    the demand for our water may decrease.     In addition, governmental restrictions on water usage during    drought conditions may result in a decreased demand for our    water, even if our water reserves are sufficient to serve our    customers during these drought conditions. However, during the    drought of the late 1980s and early 1990s the    California Public Utilities Commission beginning in 1992 allowed    us to surcharge our customers to collect lost revenues caused by    customers conservation during the drought. Regardless of    whether we may surcharge our customers during a conservation    period, they may use less water even after a drought has passed    because of conservation patterns developed during the drought.    Furthermore, our customers may wish to use recycled water as a    substitute for potable water. If rights are granted to others to    serve our customers recycled water, there will likely be a    decrease in demand for our water. The    adequacy of our water supplies depends upon a variety of factors    beyond our control. Interruption in the water supply may    adversely affect our earnings.     We depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and    future needs of our customers. Whether we have an adequate    supply varies depending upon a variety of factors, many of which    are partially or completely beyond our control, including:           the amount of rainfall;           the amount of water stored in reservoirs;           underground water supply from which well water is pumped;           changes in the amount of water used by our customers;           water quality;           legal limitations on water use such as rationing restrictions    during a drought; and           population growth.     We purchase our water supply from various governmental agencies    and others. Water supply availability may be affected by weather    conditions, funding and other political and environmental    considerations. In addition, our ability to use surface water is    subject to regulations regarding water quality and volume    limitations. If new regulations are imposed or existing    regulations are changed or given new interpretations, the    availability of surface water may be materially reduced. A    reduction in surface water could result in the need to procure    more costly water from other sources, thereby increasing our    water production costs and adversely affecting our operating    results.    16Table of Contents    We have entered into long-term agreements, which commit us to    payments whether or not we purchase any water. Therefore, if    demand is insufficient to use our required purchases we would    have to pay for water we did not receive.     From time to time, we enter into water supply contracts with    third parties and our business is dependent upon such agreements    in order to meet regional demand. For example, we have entered    into a water supply contract with the San Francisco Public    Utilities Commission which we rely upon. We can give no    assurance that the San Francisco Public Utilities    Commission, or any of the other parties from whom we purchase    water, will renew our contracts upon expiration, or that we will    not be subject to significant price increases under any such    renewed contracts.     The parties from whom we purchase water maintain significant    infrastructure and systems to deliver water to us. Maintenance    of these facilities is beyond our control. If these facilities    are not adequately maintained or if these parties otherwise    default on their obligations to supply water to us, we may not    have adequate water supplies to meet our customers needs.     If we are unable to access adequate water supplies we may be    unable to satisfy all customer demand which could result in    rationing. Rationing may have an adverse effect on cash flow    from operations. We can make no guarantee that we will always    have access to an adequate supply of water that will meet all    required quality standards. Water shortages may affect us in a    variety of ways. For example, shortages could:           adversely affect our supply mix by causing us to rely on more    expensive purchased water;           adversely affect operating costs;           increase the risk of contamination to our systems due to our    inability to maintain sufficient pressure; and           increase capital expenditures for building pipelines to connect    to alternative sources of supply, new wells to replace those    that are no longer in service or are otherwise inadequate to    meet the needs of our customers and reservoirs and other    facilities to conserve or reclaim water.     We may or may not be able to recover increased operating and    construction costs on a timely basis, or at all, for our    regulated systems through the ratemaking process. Although we    can give no assurance, we may also be able to recover certain of    these costs from third parties that may be responsible, or    potentially responsible, for groundwater contamination. Changes    in water supply costs impacts our operations     The cost to obtain water for delivery to our customers varies    depending on the sources of supply, wholesale suppliers    prices and the quantity of water produced to supply customer    water usage. Our source of supply varies by operating district.    Certain districts obtain all of their supply from wells, some    districts purchase all of the supply from wholesale suppliers    and other districts obtain the supply from a combination of well    and purchased sources. A portion of the supply is from surface    sources and processed through company-owned water treatment    plants. On average, slightly more than half of the water we    deliver to our customers is pumped from wells or received from a    surface supply with the remainder purchased from wholesale    suppliers. Water purchased from suppliers usually costs us more    than surface supplied or well pumped water. During 2008, the    cost of purchased water for delivery to customers represented    31.7% of our total operating costs and in 2007 it represented    33.1% of our total operating costs.     Wholesale water suppliers may increase their prices for water    delivered to us based on factors that affect their operating    costs. Purchased water rate increases are beyond our control. In    California, effective July 1, 2008, our ability to recover    increases in the cost of purchased water changed with the    adoption of the MCBA. With this change, any price increase will    be recorded as an expense but also as revenue. The balance in    the MCBA will be collected in the future. There may be a    short-term impact to our cash flow from operations, but the    impact to earnings has been minimized.     Depending on the degree of heat and lack of rain and other    factors that affect the adequacy of our water supply, we may    have to purchase higher-cost water to meet customer demand.    17Table of ContentsWe    depend upon an adequate supply of electricity and certain    chemicals for the delivery of our water. An interruption in the    supply of these inputs or increases in their prices could    adversely affect our results of operations.     We rely on purchased electrical power in order to operate the    wells and pumps which are needed to supply water to our    customers. We have    back-up    power generators to operate a number of our wells and pumps in    emergencies, but an extended interruption in power supply could    impact our ability to continue to supply water. In the past,    California has been subjected to rolling power blackouts due to    insufficient power supplies. We can give no assurance that we    will not be subject to power blackouts in the future. In    addition, we require sufficient supplies of certain chemicals in    order to treat the water which we supply. There are multiple    suppliers of these chemicals, but if we were to suffer an    interruption of supply we might not be able to adequately treat    our water.     Purchased power expense represents electricity purchased to    operate the wells and pumps. Purchased power is a significant    operating expense. During 2008 and 2007, purchased power expense    represented 7.4% of our total operating costs. These costs,    which are beyond our control, can and do increase unpredictably.    These costs can also increase in substantial amounts, as    occurred in California during 2001 when rates we paid for    electricity increased 48%. Cash flows between rate filings may    be adversely affected until the commission authorizes a rate    change. We track the expense differences caused by the rate    change as part of our MCBA. Cost of chemicals used in the    delivery of water is not an element of the MCBA and therefore    any variances in quantity or cost could impact our results of    operations. Our    ability to generate new operating contracts is affected by local    politics.     Our revenue growth depends upon our ability to generate new as    well as to renew operating contracts with cities, other agencies    and municipal utility districts. Because we are selling our    services in a political environment, we are subject to changing    trends and municipal preferences. Recent terrorist acts have    affected some political viewpoints relative to outsourcing of    water or wastewater utility services. Municipalities own and    municipal employees operate the majority of water and wastewater    systems. A significant portion of our marketing and sales    efforts is spent demonstrating the benefits of contract    operations to elected officials and municipal authorities. The    existing political environment means that decisions are based on    many factors, not just economic factors. Our    business requires significant capital expenditures that are    dependent on our ability to secure appropriate funding. If we    are unable to obtain sufficient capital or if the rates at which    we borrow increase, there would be a negative impact on our    results of operations.     The water utility business is capital-intensive. We invest    significant funds to add or replace property, plant and    equipment. In addition, water shortages may adversely affect us    by causing us to rely on more purchased water. This could cause    increases in capital expenditures needed to build pipelines to    secure alternative water sources. In addition, we require    capital to grow our business through acquisitions. We fund our    short-term capital requirements from cash received from    operations and funds received from developers. We also borrow    funds from banks under short-term bank lending arrangements. We    seek to meet our long-term capital needs by raising equity    through common or preferred stock issues or issuing debt    obligations. We cannot give any assurance that these sources    will continue to be adequate or that the cost of funds will    remain at levels permitting us to earn a reasonable rate of    return. In the event we are unable to obtain sufficient capital,    our expansion efforts could be curtailed, which may affect our    growth and may affect our future results of operations.     Our ability to access the capital markets is affected by the    ratings of certain of our debt securities. Standard &    Poors Rating Agency issues a rating on California Water    Service Companys ability to repay certain debt    obligations. The credit rating agency could downgrade our credit    rating based on reviews of our financial performance and    projections or upon the occurrence of other events that could    impact our business outlook. Standard & Poors    rating is A+ with a stable outlook. Lower ratings by the agency    could restrict our ability to access equity and debt capital. We    can give no assurance that the rating agency will maintain    ratings which allow us to borrow under advantageous conditions    and at reasonable interest rates. A future downgrade by the    agency could also increase our cost of capital by causing    potential investors to require a higher interest rate due to a    perceived risk related to our ability to repay outstanding debt    obligations.    18Table of Contents    While the majority of our debt is long term at fixed rates, we    do have interest rate exposure in our short-term borrowings    which have variable interest rates. We are also subject to    interest rate risks on new financings. However, if interest    rates were to increase on a long-term basis, our management    believes that customer rates would increase accordingly, subject    to approval by the appropriate commission. We can give no    assurance that the commission would approve such an increase in    customer rates.     We are obligated to comply with specified debt covenants under    certain of our loan and debt agreements. Failure to maintain    compliance with these covenants could limit future borrowing,    and we could face increased borrowing costs, litigation,    acceleration of maturity schedules, and cross default issues.    Such actions by our creditors could have a material adverse    effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If the    national and world-wide financial crisis intensifies, potential    disruptions in the financial and real estate markets may    adversely affect our business, including by adversely affecting    the availability and cost of short-term funds for our liquidity    requirements, our ability to meet long-term commitments and our    customers ability to pay for water, which in turn could    adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and    financial condition.     We rely on our current credit facilities to fund short-term    liquidity needs if internal funds are not available from    operations. Specifically, given the seasonal fluctuations in    demand for our water we commonly draw on our credit facilities    to meet our cash requirements at times in the year when demand    is relatively low. We also may occasionally use letters of    credit issued under our revolving credit facilities. Disruptions    in the capital and credit markets or further deterioration in    the strength of financial institutions could adversely affect    our ability to draw on our credit facilities. Our access to    funds under our credit facilities is dependent on the ability of    our bank to meet its funding commitments. At present, our credit    facilities are funded by a single bank. Our bank may not be able    to meet its funding commitments to us if it experiences    shortages of capital and liquidity or if it experiences    excessive volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers    within a short period of time.     Longer-term disruptions in the financial markets as a result of    uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced    capital-raising alternatives, or failures of significant    financial institutions or other factors could adversely affect    our access to liquidity. Any disruption could require us to take    measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until    alternative credit arrangements or other funding for business    needs can be arranged. Such measures could include deferring    capital expenditures, dividend payments or other discretionary    uses of cash.     Many of our customers and suppliers also have exposure to risks    that their ability to meet their payment and supply commitments    are adversely affected by the worldwide financial crisis and    recession in the United States and resulting potential    disruptions in the financial and real estate markets. We operate    in geographic areas that may be particularly susceptible to    declines in the price of real property and other consequences of    the financial crisis, which could result in significant declines    in demand for our products and services in certain of our    districts. In the event that any of our significant customers or    suppliers, or a significant number of smaller customers and    suppliers, are adversely affected by these risks, we may face    disruptions in supply, significant reductions in demand for our    products and services, inability of customers to pay invoices    when due, and other adverse effects that could negatively affect    our financial condition, results of operations    and/or cash    flows.     Our operations and certain contracts for water distribution and    treatment depend on the financial capability of state and local    governments, and other municipal entities such as water    districts. Major disruptions in the financial strength or    operations of such entities, such as liquidity limitations,    bankruptcy or insolvency, could have an adverse effect on our    ability to conduct our business    and/or    enforce our rights under contracts to which such entities are a    party. We are    a holding company that depends on cash flow from our    subsidiaries to meet our obligations and to pay dividends on our    common stock.     As a holding company, we conduct substantially all of our    operations through our subsidiaries and our only significant    assets are investments in those subsidiaries. 95% of our    revenues are derived from the operations of California Water    Service Company. As a result, we are dependent on cash flow from    our subsidiaries, and California Water Service Company in    particular, to meet our obligations and to pay dividends on our    common stock.    19Table of Contents    We can make dividend payments only from our surplus (the excess,    if any, of our net assets over total paid-in capital) or if    there is no surplus, the net profits for the current fiscal year    or the fiscal year before which the dividend is declared. In    addition, we can pay cash dividends only if after paying those    dividends we would be able to pay our liabilities as they become    due. Owners of our capital stock cannot force us to pay    dividends and dividends will only be paid if and when declared    by our board of directors. Our board of directors can elect at    any time, and for an indefinite duration, not to declare    dividends on our capital stock.     Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and    generally have no obligation to pay any amounts due on    California Water Service Groups debt or to provide    California Water Service Group with funds for dividends.    Although there are no contractual or regulatory restrictions on    the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us, the    reasonableness of our capital structure is one of the factors    considered by state and local regulatory agencies in their    ratemaking determinations. Therefore, transfer of funds from our    subsidiaries to us for the payment of our obligations or    dividends may have an adverse effect on ratemaking    determinations. Furthermore, our right to receive cash or other    assets upon the liquidation or reorganization of a subsidiary is    generally subject to the prior claims of creditors of that    subsidiary. If we are unable to obtain funds from our    subsidiaries in a timely manner we may be unable to meet our    obligations or pay dividends. An    important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition of    water and wastewater systems, including pursuant to operating    agreements. Risks associated with potential acquisitions,    divestitures or restructurings may adversely affect    us.     We may seek to acquire or invest in other companies,    technologies, services or products that complement our business.    The execution of our growth strategy may expose us to different    risks than those associated with our utility operations. We can    give no assurance that we will succeed in finding attractive    acquisition candidates or investments, or that we would be able    to reach mutually agreeable terms with such parties. In    addition, as consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water    and wastewater industries, the prices for suitable acquisition    candidates may increase to unacceptable levels and limit our    ability to grow through acquisitions. If we are unable to find    acquisition candidates or investments, our ability to grow may    be limited.     Acquisition and investment transactions may result in the    issuance of our equity securities that could be dilutive if the    acquisition or business opportunity does not develop in    accordance with our business plan. They may also result in    significant write-offs and an increase in our debt. The    occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse    effect on our business, financial condition and results of    operations.     Any of these transactions could involve numerous additional    risks. For example, we may incur one or more of the following:           problems integrating the acquired operations, personnel,    technologies or products with our existing businesses and    products;           diversion of management time and attention from our core    business to the acquired business;           failure to retain key technical, management, sales and other    personnel of the acquired business;           difficulty in retaining relationships with suppliers and    customers of the acquired business; and           difficulty in getting required regulatory approvals.     In addition, the businesses and other assets we acquire may not    achieve the sales and profitability expected. The occurrence of    one or more of these events may have a material adverse effect    on our business. There can be no assurance that we will be    successful in overcoming these or any other significant risks    encountered.    20Table of ContentsWe may    not be able to increase or sustain our recent growth rate, and    we may not be able to manage our future growth    effectively.     We may be unable to continue to expand our business or manage    future growth. To successfully manage our growth and handle the    responsibilities of being a public company, we believe we must    effectively:           hire, train, integrate and manage additional qualified engineers    for research and development activities, sales and marketing    personnel, and financial and information technology personnel;           retain key management and augment our management team;           implement and improve additional and existing administrative,    financial and operations systems, procedures and controls;           expand and upgrade our technological capabilities; and           manage multiple relationships with our customers, regulators,    suppliers and other third parties.     If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be    able to take advantage of market opportunities, satisfy customer    requirements, execute our business plan or respond to    competitive pressures. We    have a number of large-volume commercial and industrial    customers and a significant decrease in consumption by one or    more of these customers could have an adverse effect on our    operating results and cash flows.     Our revenues will decrease, and such decrease may be material,    if a significant business or industrial customer terminates or    materially reduces its use of our water. Approximately    $94.6 million, or 23% of our 2008 water utility revenues    was derived from business and industrial customers. If any of    our large business or industrial customers reduces or ceases its    consumption of our water, we may seek commission approval to    increase the rates of our remaining customers to offset    decreased revenues. There can be no assurance, however, that the    commission would approve such a rate relief request, and even if    it did approve such a request, it would not apply retroactively    to the date of the reduction in consumption. The delay between    such date and the effective date of the rate relief may be    significant and could adversely affect our operating results and    cash flows. Our    operating cost and costs of providing services may rise faster    than our revenues.     Our ability to increase rates over time is dependent upon    approval of such rate increases by state commissions, which may    be inclined, for political or other reasons, to limit rate    increases. However, our costs are subject to market conditions    and other factors, which may increase significantly. The second    largest component of our operating costs after water production    is made up of salaries and wages. These costs are affected by    the local supply and demand for qualified labor. Other large    components of our costs are general insurance, workers    compensation insurance, employee benefits and health insurance    costs. These costs may increase disproportionately to rate    increases authorized by state commissions and may have a    material adverse effect on our future results of operations. Our    non-regulated business operates in a competitive    market.     While a majority of our business is regulated, our non-regulated    business participates in a competitive market. We compete with    several larger companies whose size, financial resources,    customer base and technical expertise may restrict our ability    to compete successfully for certain operations and maintenance    contracts. Due to the nature of our contract operations    business, and to the very competitive nature of the market, we    must accurately estimate the cost and profitability of each    project while, at the same time, maintaining prices at a level    low enough to compete with other companies. Our inability to    achieve this balance could adversely impact our results of    operations. Demand    for our stock may fluctuate due to circumstances beyond our    control.     We believe that stockholders invest in public utility stocks, in    part, because they seek reliable dividend payments. If there is    an over-supply of stock of public utilities in the market    relative to demand by such investors,    21Table of Contents    the trading price of our securities could decrease.    Additionally, if interest rates rise above the dividend yield    offered by our equity securities, demand for our stock, and    consequently its market price, may also decrease. The    price of our common stock may be volatile and may be affected by    market conditions beyond our control.     The trading price of our common stock may fluctuate in the    future because of the volatility of the stock market and a    variety of other factors, many of which are beyond our control.    Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of    our common stock include: regulatory developments; general    economic conditions and trends; price and volume fluctuations in    the overall stock market from time to time; actual or    anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of    operations; actual or anticipated changes in the expectations of    investors or securities analysts; actual or anticipated    developments in our competitors businesses or the    competitive landscape generally; litigation involving us or our    industry; major catastrophic events or sales of large blocks of    our stock.     Equity markets in general have recently experienced extreme    price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of many    companies have decreased substantially. Such price and volume    fluctuations may continue to adversely affect the market price    of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our business or    operating results. Adverse    investment returns and other factors may increase our pension    liability and pension funding requirements.     A substantial number of our employees are covered by a defined    benefit pension plan. At present, the pension plan is    underfunded because our projected pension benefit obligation    exceeds the aggregate fair value of plan assets. Under    applicable law, we are required to make cash contributions to    the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding levels    imposed by regulatory requirements. The amount of such required    cash contribution is based on an actuarial valuation of the    plan. The funded status of the plan can be affected by    investment returns on plan assets, discount rates, mortality    rates of plan participants, pension reform legislation and a    number of other factors. There can be no assurance that the    value of our pension plan assets will be sufficient to cover    future liabilities. Although we have made contributions to our    pension plan in recent years, it is possible that we could incur    a pension liability adjustment, or could be required to make    additional cash contributions to our pension plan, which would    reduce the cash available for business and other needs. Work    stoppages and other labor relations matters could adversely    affect our operating results.     At December 31, 2008, 595 of our 929 total employees were    union employees. Most of our unionized employees are represented    by the Utility Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO, except certain    engineering and laboratory employees who are represented by the    International Federation of Professional and Technical    Engineers, AFL-CIO. In November 2008 we negotiated 2009 wage    increases with both unions of 3.0%.     We believe our labor relations are good, but in light of rising    costs for healthcare and pensions, contract negotiations in the    future may be difficult. Furthermore, changes in applicable law    or regulations could have an adverse effect on managements    negotiating position with respect to our currently unionized    employees    and/or    employees that decide to unionize in the future. We are subject    to a risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters as    we negotiate with the unions to address these issues, which    could affect our results of operations and financial condition.    We can give no assurance that issues with our labor forces will    be resolved favorably to us in the future or that we will not    experience work stoppages. We    depend significantly on the services of the members of our    management team, and the departure of any of those persons could    cause our operating results to suffer.     Our success depends significantly on the continued individual    and collective contributions of our management team. The loss of    the services of any member of our management team could have a    material adverse effect on our business as our management team    has knowledge of our industry and customers and would be    difficult to replace.    22Table of ContentsOur    operations are geographically concentrated in California and    this lack of diversification may negatively impact our    operations.     Although we own facilities in a number of states, over 95% of    our operations are located in California. As a result, we are    largely subject to weather, political, water supply, labor,    utility cost, regulatory and economic risks affecting California.     We are also affected by the real property market in California.    In order to grow our business, we may need to acquire additional    real estate or rights to use real property owned by third    parties, the cost of which tends to be higher and more volatile    in California relative to other states. The value of our assets    in California may decline if there is a decline in the    California real estate market which results in a significant    decrease in real property values.     In 2007 and 2008 we experienced an increases in uncollectible    accounts, which, we believe, were attributable in part to the    significant decline in real estate values, experienced by our    customers in a number of our districts in California. The    effects of natural disasters, terrorist activity, pandemics, or    poor water quality or contamination to our water supply may    result in disruption in our services and litigation which could    adversely affect our business, operating results and financial    condition.     We operate in areas that are prone to earthquakes, fires,    mudslides and other natural disasters. A significant seismic    event in California, where our operations are concentrated, or    other natural disaster in California could adversely impact our    ability to deliver water and adversely affect our costs of    operations. A major disaster could damage or destroy substantial    capital assets. The California Public Utilities Commission has    historically allowed utilities to establish a catastrophic event    memorandum account as another possible mechanism to recover    costs. However, we can give no assurance that the CPUC or any    other commission would allow any such cost recovery mechanism in    the future.     Our water supplies are subject to contamination, including    contamination from the development of naturally-occurring    compounds, chemicals in groundwater systems, pollution resulting    from man-made sources, such as MTBE, sea water incursion and    possible terrorist attacks. If our water supply is contaminated,    we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we    are able to substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated    water source. In addition, we may incur significant costs in    order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our    current treatment facilities, or development of new treatment    methods. If we are unable to substitute water supply from an    uncontaminated water source, or to adequately treat the    contaminated water source in a cost-effective manner, there may    be an adverse effect on our revenues, operating results and    financial condition. The costs we incur to decontaminate a water    source or an underground water system could be significant and    could adversely affect our business, operating results and    financial condition and may not be recoverable in rates. We    could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human    exposure to hazardous substances in our water supplies or other    environmental damage. For example, private plaintiffs have the    right to bring personal injury or other toxic tort claims    arising from the presence of hazardous substances in our    drinking water supplies. Our insurance policies may not be    sufficient to cover the costs of these claims.     We operate a dam. If the dam were to fail for any reason, we    would lose a water supply and flooding likely would occur.    Whether or not we were responsible for the dams failure,    we could be sued. We can give no assurance that we would be able    to successfully defend such a suit.     In light of the threats to the nations health and security    ensuing in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist    attacks, we have taken steps to increase security measures at    our facilities and heighten employee awareness of threats to our    water supply. We have also tightened our security measures    regarding the delivery and handling of certain chemicals used in    our business. We have and will continue to bear increased costs    for security precautions to protect our facilities, operations    and supplies. These costs may be significant. Despite these    tightened security measures, we may not be in a position to    control the outcome of terrorist events should they occur.     We depend upon our skilled and trained workforce to ensure water    delivery. Were a pandemic to occur, we can give no assurance    that we would be able to maintain sufficient manpower to ensure    uninterrupted service in all of the districts that we serve.    23Table of ContentsWe    retain certain risks not covered by our insurance    policies.     We evaluate our risks and insurance coverage annually. Our    evaluation considers the costs, risks and benefits of retaining    versus insuring various risks as well as the availability of    certain types of insurance coverage. In addition, portions of    our business are difficult or impracticable to insure.    Furthermore, we are also affected by increases in prices for    insurance coverage; in particular, we have been, and will    continue to be, affected by rising health insurance costs.    Retained risks are associated with deductible limits, partial    self-insurance programs and insurance policy coverage ceilings.    If we suffer an uninsured loss, we may be unable to pass all, or    any portion, of the loss on to customers because our rates are    regulated by regulatory commissions. Consequently, uninsured    losses may negatively affect our financial condition, liquidity    and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we    will not face uninsured losses pertaining to the risks we have    retained. We    rely on our information technology and a number of complex    business systems that could malfunction and result in negative    impacts on our profitability and cash flow.     Our business is dependent on several complex business systems,    certain of which are owned by third parties. The business    systems must function reliably in order for us to operate    effectively. Among other things, system malfunctions and    security breaches could prevent us from operating or monitoring    our facilities, billing accurately and timely analysis of    financial results. Our profitability and cash flow could be    affected negatively in the event these systems do not operate    effectively or are circumvented. The    accuracy of our judgments and estimates about financial and    accounting matters will impact our operating results and    financial condition.     We make certain estimates and judgments in preparing our    financial statements regarding, among others:           the useful life of intangible rights;           the number of years to depreciate certain assets;           amounts to set aside for uncollectible accounts receivable,    inventory obsolesces and uninsured losses;           our legal exposure and the appropriate accrual for claims,    including medical claims and workers compensation claims;           future costs for pensions and other post-retirement    benefits; and           possible tax allowances.     The quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments will    have an impact on our operating results and financial condition.     In addition, we must estimate unbilled revenues and costs as of    the end of each accounting period. If our estimates are not    accurate, we will be required to make an adjustment in a future    period. Accounting rules permit us to use expense balancing    accounts and memorandum accounts that include input cost changes    to us that are different from amounts incorporated into the    rates approved by the commissions. These accounts result in    expenses and revenues being recognized in periods other than in    which they occurred. Our    controls and procedures may fail or be    circumvented.     Management regularly reviews and updates our internal control    over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures,    and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of    controls and procedures, however well designed and operated, is    based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only    reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the    system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and    procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to    controls and procedures could result in lack of compliance with    contractual agreements, misstatements in our financial    statements in amounts that could be material or could cause    investors to lose confidence in our reported financial    information, either of which could have a negative effect on the    trading price of our stock and may negatively affect our ability    to raise future capital.    24Table of Contents    Further, if we or our independent registered public accounting    firm discover a material weakness in our internal control over    financial reporting, the disclosure of that fact, even if    quickly remedied, could reduce the markets confidence in    our financial statements and harm our stock price. In addition,    non-compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act    of 2002 could subject us to a variety of administrative    sanctions, including the suspension or delisting of our common    stock from the New York Stock Exchange and the inability of    registered broker-dealers to make a market in our common stock,    which would further reduce our stock price. We may    be required to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards    (IFRS), or other accounting or financial reporting standards,    the ultimate adoption of which could negatively impact our    business, financial condition or results of    operations.     We could be required to adopt IFRS or other accounting or    financial reporting standards different from GAAP, which is    currently applicable to our accounting and financial reporting.    In 2008 the SEC released a timetable for the adoption of IFRS    according to which we could be required to adopt IFRS by 2016.    Under GAAP we are subject to the provisions of    SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of    Certain Types of Regulation, which, among other things,    allows us to defer certain costs if we believe it is probable    that we will be allowed to recover those costs by future rate    increases. Currently, IFRS does not contain provisions    equivalent to SFAS No. 71. The implementation and    adoption of new accounting or financial reporting standards    could affect our reported performance, which in turn could    favorably or unfavorably impact our business, financial    condition or results of operations. Furthermore, the transition    to and application of new accounting or financial reporting    standards could result in increased administrative costs. Municipalities,    water districts and other public agencies may condemn our    property by eminent domain action.     State statutes allow municipalities, water districts and other    public agencies to own and operate water systems. These agencies    are empowered to condemn properties already operated by    privately owned public utilities. However, whenever a public    agency constructs facilities to extend a utility system into the    service area of a privately owned public utility, such an act    constitutes the taking of property and requires reimbursement to    the utility for its loss. If a public agency were to acquire our    utility property by eminent domain action, we would be entitled    to just compensation for our loss, but we would no longer have    access to the condemned property nor would we be entitled to any    portion of revenue generated from the use of such asset going    forward. "
8,CWT,CALIFORNIA WATER SERVICE GP,2008-02-28,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors.     The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only    ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that    management is not aware of or focused on or that management    currently deems immaterial may also impair our business    operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our    financial condition and results of operations could be    materially and adversely affected. Risks    Related to Our Regulatory Environment Our    business is heavily regulated by state and federal regulatory    agencies and our financial viability depends upon our ability to    recover costs from our customers through rates that must be    approved by state public utility commissions.     California Water Service Company, New Mexico Water Service    Company, Washington Water Service Company and Hawaii Water    Service Company, Inc., are regulated public utilities which    provide water service to our customers. The rates that we charge    our water customers are subject to the jurisdiction of the    regulatory commissions in the states in which we operate. These    commissions set water rates for each operating district    independently because the systems are not interconnected. The    commissions authorize us to charge rates which they consider to    be sufficient to recover normal operating expenses, to provide    funds for adding new or replacing water infrastructure, and to    allow us to earn what the commissions consider to be a fair and    reasonable return on invested capital.     Our revenues and consequently our ability to meet our financial    objectives are dependent upon the rates we are authorized to    charge our customers by the commissions and our ability to    recover our costs in these rates. Our management uses forecasts,    models and estimates in order to set rates that will provide a    fair and reasonable return on our invested capital. While our    rates must be approved by the commissions, no assurance can be    given that our forecasts, models and estimates will be correct    or that the commissions will agree with our forecasts, models    and estimates. If our rates are set too low, our revenues may be    insufficient to cover our operating expenses, capital    expenditure requirements and desired dividend levels.     We periodically file rate increase applications with the    commissions. The ensuing administrative and hearing process may    be lengthy and costly. The decisions of the commissions are    beyond our control and we can provide no assurances that our    rate increase requests will be granted by the commissions. Even    if approved, there is no guarantee that approval will be given    in a timely manner or at a sufficient level to cover our    expenses and provide a reasonable return on our investment. If    the rate increase decisions are delayed, our earnings may be    adversely affected. Our    evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets    is subject to adjustment by regulatory agencies and any such    adjustment could adversely affect our results of    operations.     Regulatory decisions may also impact prospective revenues and    earnings, affect the timing of the recognition of revenues and    expenses and may overturn past decisions used in determining our    revenues and expenses. Our management continually evaluates the    anticipated recovery of regulatory assets, liabilities, and    revenues subject to refund and provides for allowances    and/or    reserves as deemed necessary. Under Financial Accounting    Standard SFAS No. 71 (Accounting for the Effects of    Certain Types of Regulation), we can defer certain costs if we    believe it is probable that we will be allowed to recover those    costs by future rate increases. If a commission determined that    a portion of our assets were not recoverable in customer rates,    we may suffer an asset impairment which would require a write    down in such assets valuation which would be recorded    through operations.     If our assessment as to the probability of recovery through the    ratemaking process is incorrect, the associated regulatory asset    or liability would be adjusted to reflect the change in our    assessment or any regulatory disallowances. A change in our    evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets    or a regulatory disallowance of all or a portion of our cost    could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.    14Table of ContentsRegulatory    agencies may disagree with our valuation and characterization of    certain of our assets.     If we determine that assets are no longer used or useful for    utility operations, we may remove them from our rate base and    subsequently sell those assets. If the commission disagrees with    our characterization, we could be subjected to penalties.    Furthermore, there is a risk that the commission could determine    that appreciation in property value should be awarded to the    ratepayers rather than our stockholders. Changes    in laws, rules and policies of regulatory agencies can    significantly affect our business.     Regulatory agencies may change their rules and policies for    various reasons, including as a result of changes in the local    political environment. In some states, regulators are elected by    popular vote or are appointed by elected officials, and the    results of elections may change the rules and policies of an    agency. As a result of the political process, long-established    rules and policies of an agency can change dramatically. For    example, in 2001 regulation regarding recovery of increases in    electrical rates changed in California. For over 20 years    prior to 2001, the California Public Utilities Commission    allowed recovery of electric rate increases under its operating    rules. However, in 2003, the commission reinstated its policy to    allow utilities to adjust their rates for rate changes by the    power companies. The original decision by the commission to    change its policy, as well as its subsequent decision to    reinstate that policy, affected our business.     We rely on policies and regulations promulgated by the various    state commissions in order to recover capital expenditures,    maintain favorable treatment on gains from the sale of real    property, offset certain production and operating costs, recover    the cost of debt, maintain an optimal equity structure without    over-leveraging, and have financial and operational flexibility    to engage in non-regulated operations. If any of the commissions    with jurisdiction over us implement policies and regulations    that do not allow us to accomplish some or all of the items    listed above, our future operating results may be adversely    affected.     In addition, legislatures may repeal, relax or tighten existing    laws, or enact new laws that impact the regulatory agencies with    jurisdiction over our business or affect our business directly.    If changes in existing laws or the implementation of new laws    limit our ability to accomplish some or all of our business    objectives, our future operating results may be adversely    affected. We    expect environmental regulation to increase, resulting in higher    operating costs in the future.     Our water and wastewater services are governed by various    federal and state environmental protection and health and safety    laws and regulations. These provisions establish criteria for    drinking water and for discharges of water, wastewater and    airborne substances. The Environmental Protection Agency    promulgates numerous nationally applicable standards, including    maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for drinking water. We believe    we are currently in compliance with all of the MCLs promulgated    to date but we can give no assurance that we will continue to    comply with all water quality requirements. If we violate any    federal or state regulations or laws governing health and    safety, we could be subject to substantial fines or otherwise    sanctioned.     Environmental laws are complex and change frequently. They have    tended to become more stringent over time. As new or stricter    standards are introduced, they could increase our operating    costs. Although we would likely seek permission to recover these    costs through rate increases, we can give no assurance that the    commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover    these additional compliance costs.     We are required to test our water quality for certain chemicals    and potential contaminants on a regular basis. If the test    results indicate that we exceed allowable limits, we may be    required either to commence treatment to remove the contaminant    or to develop an alternate water source. Either of these results    may be costly, and there can be no assurance that the    commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover    these additional compliance costs. We are    party to a toxic contamination lawsuit which could result in our    paying damages not covered by insurance.     In 1995, the State of Californias Department of Toxic    Substances Control (DTSC) named us as a potential responsible    party for cleanup of a toxic contamination plume in the Chico    groundwater. In December 2002, we were    15Table of Contents    named along with other defendants in two lawsuits filed by DTSC    for the cleanup of the plumes. The toxic spill occurred when    cleaning solvents, which were discharged into the citys    sewer system by local dry cleaners, leaked into the underground    water supply. The DTSC contends that our responsibility stems    from our operation of wells in the surrounding vicinity that    caused the contamination plumes to spread. While we are    cooperating with the clean up, we deny any responsibility for    the contamination or the resulting cleanup.     In 2007, the Company entered into Court approved consent decrees    (Consent Decrees). The Consent Decrees conditioned the    Companys performance upon many factors, including, but not    limited to, water pumped and treated by the Company must meet    regulatory standards so the Company may distribute to its    customers. Pursuant to the terms of the Consent Decrees, the    Company will incur capital costs of $1.5 million and future    operating costs with a present value of approximately    $2.6 million. In its 2007 general rate case (GRC)    settlement negotiations, Division of Ratepayer Advocates have    tentatively agreed to track all costs associated with the    Consent Decrees including legal costs to pursue insurance    coverage for potential future recovery in rates.     In connection with these suits, our insurance carrier has filed    a separate lawsuit against us for reimbursement of past defense    costs which approximate $1.5 million. We believe that the    insurance carrier has a duty to defend and is not entitled to    any defense cost reimbursement. Furthermore, we believe that    insurance coverage exists for the Companys claims.    However, if our claim is ultimately found to be excludable under    insurance policies, we may have to pay damages. Although we    consider it probable that we will be able to recover amounts    paid for damages through rate increases, we can give no    assurance that we will be able to make such a recovery.     The number of environmental and product-related lawsuits against    other water utilities have increased in frequency in recent    years. If we are subject to additional environmental or    product-related lawsuits, we might incur significant legal costs    and it is uncertain whether we would be able to recover the    legal costs from ratepayers or other third parties. In addition,    if current California law regarding California Public Utilities    Commissions preemptive jurisdiction over regulated public    utilities for claims about compliance with California Department    of Health Services and United States Environmental Protection    Agency water quality standards changes, our legal exposure may    be significantly increased. Risks    Related to Our Business Operations Wastewater    operations entail significant risks.     While wastewater collection and treatment is not presently a    major component of our revenues, wastewater collection and    treatment involve many risks associated with damage to the    surrounding environment. If collection or treatment systems fail    or do not operate properly, untreated or partially treated    wastewater could discharge onto property or into nearby streams    and rivers, causing property damage or injury to aquatic life,    or even human life. Liabilities resulting from such damage could    materially and adversely affect our results of operations and    financial condition. Demand    for our water is subject to various factors and is affected by    seasonal fluctuations.     Demand for our water during the warmer, dry months is generally    greater than during cooler or rainy months due primarily to    additional requirements for water in connection with irrigation    systems, swimming pools, cooling systems and other outside water    use. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically    warmer months, demand will vary with temperature and rainfall    levels. If temperatures during the typically warmer months are    cooler than normal, or if there is more rainfall than normal,    the demand for our water may decrease and adversely affect our    revenues.     In addition, governmental restrictions on water usage during    drought conditions may result in a decreased demand for our    water, even if our water reserves are sufficient to serve our    customers during these drought conditions. However, during the    drought of the late 1980s and early 1990s the    California Public Utilities Commission beginning in 1992 allowed    us to surcharge our customers to collect lost revenues caused by    customers conservation during the drought. Regardless of    whether we may surcharge our customers during a conservation    period, they may use less water even after a drought has passed    because of conservation patterns developed during the drought.    Furthermore, our customers may wish to use recycled water as a    substitute for potable water. If rights    16Table of Contents    are granted to others to serve our customers recycled water,    there will likely be a decrease in demand for our water. Any    decreases in demand for our water will likely adversely affect    our revenues and earnings.     Because the demand for water varies by season, our revenues may    vary greatly from quarter to quarter, even though our fixed    costs and expenses will not. Therefore, the results of    operations for one period may not indicate results to be    expected in another period. The    adequacy of our water supplies depends upon a variety of factors    beyond our control. Interruption in the water supply may    adversely affect our earnings.     We depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and    future needs of our customers. Whether we have an adequate    supply varies depending upon a variety of factors, many of which    are partially or completely beyond our control, including:           the amount of rainfall;           the amount of water stored in reservoirs;           underground water supply from which well water is pumped;           changes in the amount of water used by our customers;           water quality;           legal limitations on water use such as rationing restrictions    during a drought; and           population growth.     We purchase our water supply from various governmental agencies    and others. Water supply availability may be affected by weather    conditions, funding and other political and environmental    considerations. In addition, our ability to use surface water is    subject to regulations regarding water quality and volume    limitations. If new regulations are imposed or existing    regulations are changed or given new interpretations, the    availability of surface water may be materially reduced. A    reduction in surface water could result in the need to procure    more costly water from other sources, thereby increasing our    water production costs and adversely affecting our operating    results.     We have entered into long-term agreements, which commit us to    payments whether or not we purchase any water. Therefore, if    demand is insufficient to use our required purchases we would    have to pay for water we did not receive.     From time to time, we enter into water supply contracts with    third parties and our business is dependent upon such agreements    in order to meet regional demand. For example, we have entered    into a water supply contract with the San Francisco Public    Utilities Commission which we rely upon. We can give no    assurance that the San Francisco Public Utilities    Commission, or any of the other parties from whom we purchase    water, will renew our contracts upon expiration, or that we will    not be subject to significant price increases under any such    renewed contracts.     The parties from whom we purchase water maintain significant    infrastructure and systems to deliver water to us. Maintenance    of these facilities is beyond our control. If these facilities    are not adequately maintained or if these parties otherwise    default on their obligations to supply water to us, we may not    have adequate water supplies to meet our customers needs.     If we are unable to access adequate water supplies we may be    unable to satisfy all customer demand which could result in    rationing and would have an adverse effect on our earnings and    financial condition. We can make no guarantee that we will    always have access to an adequate supply of water that will meet    all required quality standards. Water shortages may affect us in    a variety of ways. For example, shortages could:           adversely affect our supply mix by causing us to rely on more    expensive purchased water;           adversely affect operating costs;           increase the risk of contamination to our systems due to our    inability to maintain sufficient pressure; and    17Table of Contents           increase capital expenditures for building pipelines to connect    to alternative sources of supply, new wells to replace those    that are no longer in service or are otherwise inadequate to    meet the needs of our customers and reservoirs and other    facilities to conserve or reclaim water.     We may or may not be able to recover increased operating and    construction costs on a timely basis, or at all, for our    regulated systems through the ratemaking process. Although we    can give no assurance, we may also be able to recover certain of    these costs from third parties that may be responsible, or    potentially responsible, for groundwater contamination. Changes    in water supply costs directly affect our    earnings.     The cost to obtain water for delivery to our customers varies    depending on the sources of supply, wholesale suppliers    prices and the quantity of water produced to supply customer    water usage. Our source of supply varies by operating district.    Certain districts obtain all of their supply from wells, some    districts purchase all of the supply from wholesale suppliers    and other districts obtain the supply from a combination of well    and purchased sources. A portion of the supply is from surface    sources and processed through company-owned water treatment    plants. On average, slightly more than half of the water we    deliver to our customers is pumped from wells or received from a    surface supply with the remainder purchased from wholesale    suppliers. Water purchased from suppliers usually costs us more    than surface supplied or well pumped water. During 2007, the    cost of purchased water for delivery to customers represented    33.1% of our total operating costs and in 2006 it represented    31.7% of our total operating costs.     Wholesale water suppliers may increase their prices for water    delivered to us based on factors that affect their operating    costs. Purchased water rate increases are beyond our control. In    California, our ability to recover increases in the cost of    purchased water is subject to decisions by the regulatory    commission. If we are not allowed to recover the higher costs,    our cash flows and our capital resources and liquidity could be    negatively affected. Also, our profit margins may be adversely    affected, unless the commissions allow us to seek reimbursement    of those costs from our customers.     Depending on the degree of heat and lack of rain and other    factors that affect the adequacy of our water supply, we may    have to purchase higher-cost water to meet customer demand. In    such circumstances, we may be unable to increase our rates in    line with the cost of our purchased water. Therefore, while our    revenues may increase, we may experience lower profit margins    during periods of peak demand. We    depend upon an adequate supply of electricity and certain    chemicals for the delivery of our water. An interruption in the    supply of these inputs or increases in their prices could    adversely affect our results of operations.     We rely on purchased electrical power in order to operate the    wells and pumps which are needed to supply water to our    customers. We have    back-up    power generators to operate a number of our wells and pumps in    emergencies, but an extended interruption in power supply could    impact our ability to continue to supply water. In the past,    California has been subjected to rolling power blackouts due to    insufficient power supplies. We can give no assurance that we    will not be subject to power blackouts in the future. In    addition, we require sufficient supplies of certain chemicals in    order to treat the water which we supply. There are multiple    suppliers of these chemicals, but if we were to suffer an    interruption of supply we might not be able to adequately treat    our water.     Purchased power expense represents electricity purchased to    operate the wells and pumps. Purchased power is a significant    operating expense. During 2007, purchased power expense    represented 7.4% of our total operating costs and in 2006 it    represented 7.7% of our total operating costs. These costs,    which are beyond our control, can and do increase unpredictably.    These costs can also increase in substantial amounts, as    occurred in California during 2001 when rates we paid for    electricity increased 48%. Cash flows between general rate case    filings and our earnings may be adversely affected until the    commission authorizes a rate change. We are allowed to track the    expense differences caused by the rate change and request future    recovery, which is subject to an earnings test.    18Table of ContentsOur    ability to generate new operating contracts is affected by local    politics.     Our revenue growth depends upon our ability to generate new as    well as to renew operating contracts with cities, other agencies    and municipal utility districts. Because we are selling our    services in a political environment, we are subject to changing    trends and municipal preferences. Recent terrorist acts have    affected some political viewpoints relative to outsourcing of    water or wastewater utility services. Municipalities own and    municipal employees operate the majority of water and wastewater    systems. A significant portion of our marketing and sales    efforts is spent demonstrating the benefits of contract    operations to elected officials and municipal authorities. The    existing political environment means that decisions are based on    many factors, not just economic factors. Our    business requires significant capital expenditures that are    dependent on our ability to secure appropriate funding. If we    are unable to obtain sufficient capital or if the rates at which    we borrow increase, there would be a negative impact on our    results of operations.     The water utility business is capital-intensive. We invest    significant funds to add or replace property, plant and    equipment. In addition, water shortages may adversely affect us    by causing us to rely on more purchased water. This could cause    increases in capital expenditures needed to build pipelines to    secure alternative water sources. In addition, we require    capital to grow our business through acquisitions. We fund our    short-term capital requirements from cash received from    operations and funds received from developers. We also borrow    funds from banks under short-term bank lending arrangements. We    seek to meet our long-term capital needs by raising equity    through common or preferred stock issues or issuing debt    obligations. We cannot give any assurance that these sources    will continue to be adequate or that the cost of funds will    remain at levels permitting us to earn a reasonable rate of    return. In the event we are unable to obtain sufficient capital,    our expansion efforts could be curtailed, which may affect our    growth and may affect our future results of operations.     Our ability to access the capital markets is effected by the    ratings of certain of our debt securities. Standard &    Poors Rating Agency issues a rating on California Water    Service Companys ability to repay certain debt    obligations. The credit rating agency could downgrade our credit    rating based on reviews of our financial performance and    projections or upon the occurrence of other events that could    impact our business outlook. Standard & Poors    rating is A+ with a stable outlook. Lower ratings by the agency    could restrict our ability to access equity and debt capital. We    can give no assurance that the rating agency will maintain    ratings which allow us to borrow under advantageous conditions    and at reasonable interest rates. A future downgrade by the    agency could also increase our cost of capital by causing    potential investors to require a higher interest rate due to a    perceived risk related to our ability to repay outstanding debt    obligations.     While the majority of our debt is long term at fixed rates, we    do have interest rate exposure in our short-term borrowings    which have variable interest rates. We are also subject to    interest rate risks on new financings. However, if interest    rates were to increase on a long-term basis, our management    believes that customer rates would increase accordingly, subject    to approval by the appropriate commission. We can give no    assurance that the commission would approve such an increase in    customer rates.     We are obligated to comply with specified debt covenants under    certain of our loan and debt agreements. Failure to maintain    compliance with these covenants could limit future borrowing,    and we could face increased borrowing costs, litigation,    acceleration of maturity schedules, and cross default issues.    Such actions by our creditors could have a material adverse    effect on our results of operations. We are    a holding company that depends on cash flow from our    subsidiaries to meet our obligations and to pay dividends on our    preferred stock and common stock.     As a holding company, we conduct substantially all of our    operations through our subsidiaries and our only significant    assets are investments in those subsidiaries. More than 95% of    our revenues are derived from the operations of California Water    Service Company. As a result, we are dependent on cash flow from    our subsidiaries, and California Water Service Company in    particular, to meet our obligations and to pay dividends on our    common stock.    19Table of Contents    We can make dividend payments only from our surplus (the excess,    if any, of our net assets over total paid-in capital) or if    there is no surplus, the net profits for the current fiscal year    or the fiscal year before which the dividend is declared. In    addition, we can pay cash dividends only if after paying those    dividends we would be able to pay our liabilities as they become    due. Owners of our capital stock cannot force us to pay    dividends and dividends will only be paid if and when declared    by our board of directors. Our board of directors can elect at    any time, and for an indefinite duration, not to declare    dividends on our capital stock.     Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and    generally have no obligation to pay any amounts due on    California Water Service Groups debt or to provide    California Water Service Group with funds for dividends.    Although there are no contractual or regulatory restrictions on    the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us, the    reasonableness of our capital structure is one of the factors    considered by state and local regulatory agencies in their    ratemaking determinations. Therefore, transfer of funds from our    subsidiaries to us for the payment of our obligations or    dividends may have an adverse effect on ratemaking    determinations. Furthermore, our right to receive cash or other    assets upon the liquidation or reorganization of a subsidiary is    generally subject to the prior claims of creditors of that    subsidiary. If we are unable to obtain funds from our    subsidiaries in a timely manner we may be unable to meet our    obligations or pay dividends. An    important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition of    water and wastewater systems, including pursuant to operating    agreements. Risks associated with potential acquisitions,    divestitures or restructurings may adversely affect    us.     We may seek to acquire or invest in other companies,    technologies, services or products that complement our business.    The execution of our growth strategy may expose us to different    risks than those associated with our utility operations. We can    give no assurance that we will succeed in finding attractive    acquisition candidates or investments, or that we would be able    to reach mutually agreeable terms with such parties. In    addition, as consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water    and wastewater industries, the prices for suitable acquisition    candidates may increase to unacceptable levels and limit our    ability to grow through acquisitions. If we are unable to find    acquisition candidates or investments, our ability to grow may    be limited.     Acquisition and investment transactions may result in the    issuance of our equity securities that could be dilutive if the    acquisition or business opportunity does not develop in    accordance with our business plan. They may also result in    significant write-offs and an increase in our debt. The    occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse    effect on our business, financial condition and results of    operations.     Any of these transactions could involve numerous additional    risks. For example, we may incur one or more of the following:           problems integrating the acquired operations, personnel,    technologies or products with our existing businesses and    products;           diversion of management time and attention from our core    business to the acquired business;           failure to retain key technical, management, sales and other    personnel of the acquired business;           difficulty in retaining relationships with suppliers and    customers of the acquired business; and           difficulty in getting required regulatory approvals.     In addition, the businesses and other assets we acquire may not    achieve the sales and profitability expected. The occurrence of    one or more of these events may have a material adverse effect    on our business. There can be no assurance that we will be    successful in overcoming these or any other significant risks    encountered.    20Table of ContentsWe may    not be able to increase or sustain our recent growth rate, and    we may not be able to manage our future growth    effectively.     We may be unable to continue to expand our business or manage    future growth. To successfully manage our growth and handle the    responsibilities of being a public company, we believe we must    effectively:           hire, train, integrate and manage additional qualified engineers    for research and development activities, sales and marketing    personnel, and financial and information technology personnel;           retain key management and augment our management team;           implement and improve additional and existing administrative,    financial and operations systems, procedures and controls;           expand and upgrade our technological capabilities; and           manage multiple relationships with our customers, regulators,    suppliers and other third parties.     If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be    able to take advantage of market opportunities, satisfy customer    requirements, execute our business plan or respond to    competitive pressures. We    have a number of large-volume commercial and industrial    customers and a significant decrease in consumption by one or    more of these customers could have an adverse effect on our    operating results and cash flows.     Our revenues will decrease, and such decrease may be material,    if a significant business or industrial customer terminates or    materially reduces its use of our water. Approximately    $82.9 million, or 23% of our 2007 water utility revenues    was derived from business and industrial customers. If any of    our large business or industrial customers reduces or ceases its    consumption of our water, we may seek commission approval to    increase the rates of our remaining customers to offset    decreased revenues. There can be no assurance, however, that the    commission would approve such a rate relief request, and even if    it did approve such a request, it would not apply retroactively    to the date of the reduction in consumption. The delay between    such date and the effective date of the rate relief may be    significant and could adversely affect our operating results and    cash flows. Our    operating cost and costs of providing services may rise faster    than our revenues.     Our ability to increase rates over time is dependent upon    approval of such rate increases by state commissions, which may    be inclined, for political or other reasons, to limit rate    increases. However, our costs are subject to market conditions    and other factors, which may increase significantly. The second    largest component of our operating costs after water production    is made up of salaries and wages. These costs are affected by    the local supply and demand for qualified labor. Other large    components of our costs are general insurance, workers    compensation insurance, employee benefits and health insurance    costs. These costs may increase disproportionately to rate    increases authorized by state commissions and may have a    material adverse effect on our future results of operations. Our    non-regulated business operates in a competitive    market.     While a majority of our business is regulated, our non-regulated    business participates in a competitive market. We compete with    several larger companies whose size, financial resources,    customer base and technical expertise may restrict our ability    to compete successfully for certain operations and maintenance    contracts. Due to the nature of our contract operations    business, and to the very competitive nature of the market, we    must accurately estimate the cost and profitability of each    project while, at the same time, maintaining prices at a level    low enough to compete with other companies. Our inability to    achieve this balance could adversely impact our results of    operations. Demand    for our stock may fluctuate due to circumstances beyond our    control.     We believe that stockholders invest in public utility stocks, in    part, because they seek reliable dividend payments. If there is    an over-supply of stock of public utilities in the market    relative to demand by such investors,    21Table of Contents    the trading price of our securities could decrease.    Additionally, if interest rates rise above the dividend yield    offered by our equity securities, demand for our stock, and    consequently its market price, may also decrease. Work    stoppages and other labor relations matters could adversely    affect our operating results.     At December 31, 2007, 594 of our 891 total employees were    union employees. Most of our unionized employees are represented    by the Utility Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO, except certain    engineering and laboratory employees who are represented by the    International Federation of Professional and Technical    Engineers, AFL-CIO. In October and November 2007 we negotiated    two-year agreements with both unions Wage increases under the    agreements were 3.1% for 2008. Wages for 2009 will be negotiated    separately in the fall of 2008.     We believe our labor relations are good, but in light of rising    costs for healthcare and pensions, contract negotiations in the    future may be difficult. We are subject to a risk of work    stoppages and other labor relations matters as we negotiate with    the unions to address these issues, which could affect our    results of operations and financial condition. We can give no    assurance that issues with our labor forces will be resolved    favorably to us in the future or that we will not experience    work stoppages. We    depend significantly on the services of the members of our    management team, and the departure of any of those persons could    cause our operating results to suffer.     Our success depends significantly on the continued individual    and collective contributions of our management team. The loss of    the services of any member of our management team could have a    material adverse effect on our business as our management team    has knowledge of our industry and customers and would be    difficult to replace. Our    operations are geographically concentrated in California and    this lack of diversification may negatively impact our    operations.     Although we own facilities in a number of states, over 95% of    our operations are located in California. As a result, we are    largely subject to weather, political, water supply, labor,    utility cost, regulatory and economic risks affecting California.     We are also affected by the real property market in California.    In order to grow our business, we may need to acquire additional    real estate or rights to use real property owned by third    parties, the cost of which tends to be higher in California    relative to other states. The value of our assets in California    may decline if there is a decline in the California real estate    market which results in a significant decrease in real property    values.     In 2007 we experienced an increase in uncollectible accounts,    which, we believe, are attributed in part to the subprime    lending difficulties experienced by our customers in a number of    our districts in California. The    effects of natural disasters, terrorist activity, pandemics, or    poor water quality or contamination to our water supply may    result in disruption in our services and litigation which could    adversely affect our business, operating results and financial    condition.     We operate in areas that are prone to earthquakes, fires,    mudslides and other natural disasters. A significant seismic    event in California, where our operations are concentrated, or    other natural disaster in California could adversely impact our    ability to deliver water and adversely affect our costs of    operations. A major disaster could damage or destroy substantial    capital assets. The California Public Utilities Commission has    historically allowed utilities to establish a catastrophic event    memorandum account as another possible mechanism to recover    costs. However, we can give no assurance that the CPUC or any    other commission would allow any such cost recovery mechanism in    the future.     Our water supplies are subject to contamination, including    contamination from the development of naturally-occurring    compounds, chemicals in groundwater systems, pollution resulting    from man-made sources, such as MTBE, sea water incursion and    possible terrorist attacks. If our water supply is contaminated,    we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we    are able to substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated    water source. In addition, we may incur significant costs in    order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our    current treatment facilities, or development of new treatment    methods. If we are unable to substitute water    22Table of Contents    supply from an uncontaminated water source, or to adequately    treat the contaminated water source in a cost-effective manner,    there may be an adverse effect on our revenues, operating    results and financial condition. The costs we incur to    decontaminate a water source or an underground water system    could be significant and could adversely affect our business,    operating results and financial condition and may not be    recoverable in rates. We could also be held liable for    consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous    substances in our water supplies or other environmental damage.    For example, private plaintiffs have the right to bring personal    injury or other toxic tort claims arising from the presence of    hazardous substances in our drinking water supplies. Our    insurance policies may not be sufficient to cover the costs of    these claims.     We operate a dam. If the dam were to fail for any reason, we    would lose a water supply and flooding likely would occur.    Whether or not we were responsible for the dams failure,    we could be sued. We can give no assurance that we would be able    to successfully defend such a suit.     In light of the threats to the nations health and security    ensuing in the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist    attacks, we have taken steps to increase security measures at    our facilities and heighten employee awareness of threats to our    water supply. We have also tightened our security measures    regarding the delivery and handling of certain chemicals used in    our business. We have and will continue to bear increased costs    for security precautions to protect our facilities, operations    and supplies. These costs may be significant. Despite these    tightened security measures, we may not be in a position to    control the outcome of terrorist events should they occur.     We depend upon our skilled and trained workforce to ensure water    delivery. Were a pandemic to occur, we can give no assurance    that we would be able to maintain sufficient manpower to ensure    uninterrupted service in all of the districts that we serve. We    retain certain risks not covered by our insurance    policies.     We evaluate our risks and insurance coverage annually. Our    evaluation considers the costs, risks and benefits of retaining    versus insuring various risks as well as the availability of    certain types of insurance coverage. In addition, portions of    our business are difficult or impracticable to insure.    Furthermore, we are also affected by increases in prices for    insurance coverage; in particular, we have been, and will    continue to be, affected by rising health insurance costs.    Retained risks are associated with deductible limits, partial    self-insurance programs and insurance policy coverage ceilings.    If we suffer an uninsured loss, we may be unable to pass all, or    any portion, of the loss on to customers because our rates are    regulated by regulatory commissions. Consequently, uninsured    losses may negatively affect our financial condition, liquidity    and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we    will not face uninsured losses pertaining to the risks we have    retained. We    rely on our information technology and a number of complex    business systems that could malfunction and result in negative    impacts on our profitability and cash flow.     Our business is dependent on several complex business systems,    certain of which are owned by third parties. The business    systems must function reliably in order for us to operate    effectively. Among other things, system malfunctions and    security breaches could prevent us from operating or monitoring    our facilities, billing accurately and timely analyzing    financial results. Our profitability and cash flow could be    affected negatively in the event these systems do not operate    effectively or are circumvented. The    accuracy of our judgments and estimates about financial and    accounting matters will impact our operating results and    financial condition.     We make certain estimates and judgments in preparing our    financial statements regarding, among others:           the useful life of intangible rights;           the number of years to depreciate certain assets;           amounts to set aside for uncollectible accounts receivable,    inventory obsolesces and uninsured losses;           our legal exposure and the appropriate accrual for claims,    including medical claims and workers compensation claims;    23Table of Contents           future costs for pensions and other post-retirement    benefits; and           possible tax allowances.     The quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments will    have an impact on our operating results and financial condition.     In addition, we must estimate unbilled revenues and costs as of    the end of each accounting period. If our estimates are not    accurate, we will be required to make an adjustment in a future    period. Accounting rules permit us to use expense balancing    accounts and memorandum accounts that include input cost changes    to us that are different from amounts incorporated into the    rates approved by the commissions. These accounts result in    expenses and revenues being recognized in periods other than in    which they occurred. Our    controls and procedures may fail or be    circumvented.     Management regularly reviews and updates our internal control    over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures,    and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of    controls and procedures, however well designed and operated, is    based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only    reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the    system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and    procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to    controls and procedures could result in lack of compliance with    contractual agreements, misstatements in our financial    statements in amounts that could be material or could cause    investors to lose confidence in our reported financial    information, either of which could have a negative effect on the    trading price of our stock and may negatively affect our ability    to raise future capital.     Further, if we or our independent registered public accounting    firm discover a material weakness in our internal control over    financial reporting, the disclosure of that fact, even if    quickly remedied, could reduce the markets confidence in    our financial statements and harm our stock price. In addition,    non-compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act    of 2002 could subject us to a variety of administrative    sanctions, including the suspension or delisting of our common    stock from the New York Stock Exchange and the inability of    registered broker-dealers to make a market in our common stock,    which would further reduce our stock price. Municipalities,    water districts and other public agencies may condemn our    property by eminent domain action.     State statutes allow municipalities, water districts and other    public agencies to own and operate water systems. These agencies    are empowered to condemn properties already operated by    privately owned public utilities. However, whenever a public    agency constructs facilities to extend a utility system into the    service area of a privately owned public utility, such an act    constitutes the taking of property and requires reimbursement to    the utility for its loss. If a public agency were to acquire our    utility property by eminent domain action, we would be entitled    to just compensation for our loss, but we would no longer have    access to the condemned property nor would we be entitled to any    portion of revenue generated from the use of such asset going    forward. "
3,CWT,CALIFORNIA WATER SERVICE GP,2007-03-14,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors.     The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only    ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that    management is not aware of or focused on or that management    currently deems immaterial may also impair our business    operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our    financial condition and results of operations could be    materially and adversely affected. Risks    Related to Our Regulatory Environment Our    business is heavily regulated by state and federal regulatory    agencies and our financial viability depends upon our ability to    recover costs from our customers through rates that must be    approved by state public utility commissions.     California Water Service Company, New Mexico Water Service    Company, Washington Water Service Company and Hawaii Water    Service Company, Inc., are regulated public utilities which    provide water service    13Table of Contents    to our customers. The rates that we charge our water customers    are subject to the jurisdiction of the regulatory commissions in    the states in which we operate. These commissions set water    rates for each operating district independently because the    systems are not interconnected. The commissions authorize us to    charge rates which they consider to be sufficient to recover    normal operating expenses, to provide funds for adding new or    replacing water infrastructure, and to allow us to earn what the    commissions consider to be a fair and reasonable return on    invested capital.     Our revenues and consequently our ability to meet our financial    objectives are dependent upon the rates we are authorized to    charge our customers by the commissions and our ability to    recover our costs in these rates. Our management uses forecasts,    models and estimates in order to set rates that will provide a    fair and reasonable return on our invested capital. While our    rates must be approved by the commissions, no assurance can be    given that our forecasts, models and estimates will be correct    or that the commissions will agree with our forecasts, models    and estimates. If our rates are set too low, our revenues may be    insufficient to cover our operating expenses, capital    expenditure requirements and desired dividend levels.     We periodically file rate increase applications with the    commissions. The ensuing administrative and hearing process may    be lengthy and costly. The decisions of the commissions are    beyond our control and we can provide no assurances that our    rate increase requests will be granted by the commissions. Even    if approved, there is no guarantee that approval will be given    in a timely manner or at a sufficient level to cover our    expenses and provide a reasonable return on our investment. If    the rate increase decisions are delayed, our earnings may be    adversely affected. Our    evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets    is subject to adjustment by regulatory agencies and any such    adjustment could adversely affect our results of    operations.     Regulatory decisions may also impact prospective revenues and    earnings, affect the timing of the recognition of revenues and    expenses and may overturn past decisions used in determining our    revenues and expenses. Our management continually evaluates the    anticipated recovery of regulatory assets, liabilities, and    revenues subject to refund and provides for allowances    and/or    reserves as deemed necessary. Under Financial Accounting    Standard SFAS No. 71 (Accounting for the Effects of    Certain Types of Regulation), we can defer certain costs if we    believe we will be allowed to recover those costs by future rate    increases. If a commission determined that a portion of our    assets were not recoverable in customer rates, we may suffer an    asset impairment which would require a write down in such    assets valuation.     If our assessment as to the probability of recovery through the    ratemaking process is incorrect, the associated regulatory asset    or liability would be adjusted to reflect the change in our    assessment or any regulatory disallowances. A change in our    evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets    or a regulatory disallowance of all or a portion of our cost    could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Regulatory    agencies may disagree with our valuation and characterization of    certain of our assets.     If we determine that assets are no longer used or useful for    utility operations, we may remove them from our rate base and    subsequently sell those assets. If the commission disagrees with    our characterization, we could be subjected to penalties.    Furthermore, there is a risk that the commission could determine    that appreciation in property value should be awarded to the    ratepayers rather than our stockholders. Changes    in laws, rules and policies of regulatory agencies can    significantly affect our business.     Regulatory agencies may change their rules and policies for    various reasons, including as a result of changes in the local    political environment. In some states, regulators are elected by    popular vote or are appointed by elected officials, and the    results of elections may change the rules and policies of an    agency. As a result of the political process, long-established    rules and policies of an agency can change dramatically. For    example, in 2001 regulation regarding recovery of increases in    electrical rates changed in California. For over 20 years    prior to 2001, the California Public Utilities Commission    allowed recovery of electric rate increases under its operating    rules. However, in 2003, the commission reinstated its policy to    allow utilities to adjust their rates for rate changes by the    14Table of Contents    power companies. The original decision by the commission to    change its policy, as well as its subsequent decision to    reinstate that policy, affected our business.     We rely on policies and regulations promulgated by the various    state commissions in order to recover capital expenditures,    maintain favorable treatment on gains from the sale of real    property, offset certain production and operating costs, recover    the cost of debt, maintain an optimal equity structure without    over-leveraging, and have financial and operational flexibility    to engage in non-regulated operations. If any of the commissions    with jurisdiction over us implement policies and regulations    that do not allow us to accomplish some or all of the items    listed above, our future operating results may be adversely    affected.     In addition, legislatures may repeal, relax or tighten existing    laws, or enact new laws that impact the regulatory agencies with    jurisdiction over our business or affect our business directly.    If changes in existing laws or the implementation of new laws    limit our ability accomplish some or all of our business    objectives, our future operating results may be adversely    affected. We    expect environmental regulation to increase, resulting in higher    operating costs in the future.     Our water and wastewater services are governed by various    federal and state environmental protection and health and safety    laws and regulations. These provisions establish criteria for    drinking water and for discharges of water, wastewater and    airborne substances. The Environmental Protection Agency    promulgates numerous nationally applicable standards, including    maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for drinking water. We believe    we are currently in compliance with all of the MCLs promulgated    to date but we can give no assurance that we will continue to    comply with all water quality requirements. If we violate any    federal or state regulations or laws governing health and    safety, we could be subject to substantial fines or otherwise    sanctioned.     Environmental laws are complex and change frequently. They have    tended to become more stringent over time. As new or stricter    standards are introduced, they could increase our operating    costs. For example, we have assigned a high priority to    completing work necessary to comply with new Environmental    Protection Agency requirements concerning security of water    facilities, which actions have increased our costs. Although we    would likely seek permission to recover these costs through rate    increases, we can give no assurance that the commissions would    approve rate increases to enable us to recover these additional    compliance costs.     We are required to test our water quality for certain chemicals    and potential contaminants on a regular basis. If the test    results indicate that we exceed allowable limits, we may be    required either to commence treatment to remove the contaminant    or to develop an alternate water source. Either of these results    may be costly, and there can be no assurance that the    commissions would approve rate increases to enable us to recover    these additional compliance costs. We are    party to a toxic contamination lawsuit which could result in our    paying damages not covered by insurance.     In 1995, the State of Californias Department of Toxic    Substances Control (DTSC) named us as a potential responsible    party for cleanup of a toxic contamination plume in the Chico    groundwater. The toxic spill occurred when cleaning solvents,    which were discharged into the citys sewer system by local    dry cleaners, leaked into the underground water supply. The DTSC    contends that our responsibility stems from our operation of    wells in the surrounding vicinity that caused the contamination    plume to spread. While we are cooperating with the clean up, we    deny any responsibility for the contamination or the resulting    cleanup.     In December 2002, we were named along with other defendants in    two lawsuits filed by DTSC for the cleanup of the plume. The    suits assert that the defendants are jointly and severally    liable for the estimated cleanup of $8.7 million. The    parties have undertaken settlement negotiations. If the parties    finalize a written settlement agreement, it must then be    approved by the court. In connection with these suits, our    insurance carrier has filed a separate lawsuit against us for    reimbursement of past defense costs which approximate    $1 million. We believe that the insurance carrier has a    duty to defend and is not entitled to any defense cost    reimbursement. Furthermore, we believe that insurance coverage    exists for this claim. Consequently, we have filed a number of    pre-trial motions to dismiss the lawsuit. However, if our claim    is ultimately found to be excludable under insurance policies,    we may    15Table of Contents    have to pay damages. Although we consider it remote that we will    not be able to recover amounts paid for damages through rate    increases, we can give no assurance that we will be able to make    such a recovery.     The number of environmental and product-related lawsuits against    other water utilities have increased in frequency in recent    years. If we are subject to additional environmental or    product-related lawsuit, we might incur significant legal costs    and it is uncertain whether we would be able to recover the    legal costs from ratepayers or other third parties. In addition,    if current California law regarding California Public Utilities    Commissions preemptive jurisdiction over regulated public    utilities for claims about compliance with California Department    of Health Services and United States Environmental Protection    Agency water quality standards changes, our legal exposure may    be significantly increased. Risks    Related to Our Business Operations Wastewater    operations entail significant risks.     While wastewater collection and treatment is not presently a    major component of our revenues, wastewater collection and    treatment involve many risks associated with damage to the    surrounding environment. If collection or treatment systems fail    or do not operate properly, untreated or partially treated    wastewater could discharge onto property or into nearby streams    and rivers, causing property damage or injury to aquatic life,    or even human life. Liabilities resulting from such damage could    materially and adversely affect our results of operations and    financial condition. Demand    for our water is subject to various factors and is affected by    seasonal fluctuations.     Demand for our water during the warmer, dry months is generally    greater than during cooler or rainy months due primarily to    additional requirements for water in connection with irrigation    systems, swimming pools, cooling systems and other outside water    use. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically    warmer months, demand will vary with temperature and rainfall    levels. If temperatures during the typically warmer months are    cooler than normal, or if there is more rainfall than normal,    the demand for our water may decrease and adversely affect our    revenues.     In addition, governmental restrictions on water usage during    drought conditions may result in a decreased demand for our    water, even if our water reserves are sufficient to serve our    customers during these drought conditions. However, during the    drought of the late 1980s and early 1990s the    California Public Utilities Commission beginning in 1992 allowed    us to surcharge our customers to collect lost revenues caused by    customers conservation during the drought. Regardless of    whether we may surcharge our customers during a conservation    period, they may use less water even after a drought has passed    because of conservation patterns developed during the drought.    Furthermore, our customers may wish to use recycled water as a    substitute for potable water. If rights are granted to others to    serve our customers recycled water, there will likely be a    decrease in demand for our water. Any decreases in demand for    our water will likely adversely affect our revenues and earnings.     Because the demand for water varies by season, our revenues may    vary greatly from quarter to quarter, even though our fixed    costs and expenses will not. Therefore, the results of    operations for one period may not indicate results to be    expected in another period. The    adequacy of our water supplies depends upon a variety of factors    beyond our control. Interruption in the water supply may    adversely affect our earnings.     We depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and    future needs of our customers. Whether we have an adequate    supply varies depending upon a variety of factors, many of which    are partially or completely beyond our control, including:           the amount of rainfall;           the amount of water stored in reservoirs;           underground water supply from which well water is pumped;    16Table of Contents           changes in the amount of water used by our customers;           water quality;           legal limitations on water use such as rationing restrictions    during a drought; and           population growth.     We purchase our water supply from various governmental agencies    and others. Water supply availability may be affected by weather    conditions, funding and other political and environmental    considerations. In addition, our ability to use surface water is    subject to regulations regarding water quality and volume    limitations. If new regulations are imposed or existing    regulations are changed or given new interpretations, the    availability of surface water may be materially reduced. A    reduction in surface water could result in the need to procure    more costly water from other sources, thereby increasing our    water production costs and adversely affecting our operating    results.     We have entered into long-term agreements, which commit us to    payments whether or not we purchase any water. Therefore, if    demand is insufficient to use our required purchases we would    have to pay for water we did not receive.     From time to time, we enter into water supply contracts with    third parties and our business is dependent upon such agreements    in order to meet regional demand. For example, we have entered    into a water supply contract with the San Francisco Public    Utilities Commission which we rely upon. We can give no    assurance that the San Francisco Public Utilities    Commission, or any of the other parties from whom we purchase    water, will renew our contracts upon expiration, or that we will    not be subject to significant price increases under any such    renewed contracts.     The parties from whom we purchase water maintain significant    infrastructure and systems to deliver water to us. Maintenance    of these facilities is beyond our control. If these facilities    are not adequately maintained or if these parties otherwise    default on their obligations to supply water to us, we may not    have adequate water supplies to meet our customers needs.     If we are unable to access adequate water supplies we may be    unable to satisfy all customer demand which could result in    rationing and would have an adverse effect on our earnings and    financial condition. We can make no guarantee that we will    always have access to an adequate supply of water that will meet    all required quality standards. Water shortages may affect us in    a variety of ways. For example, shortages could:           adversely affect our supply mix by causing us to rely on more    expensive purchased water;           adversely affect operating costs;           increase the risk of contamination to our systems due to our    inability to maintain sufficient pressure; and           increase capital expenditures for building pipelines to connect    to alternative sources of supply, new wells to replace those    that are no longer in service or are otherwise inadequate to    meet the needs of our customers and reservoirs and other    facilities to conserve or reclaim water.     We may or may not be able to recover increased operating and    construction costs on a timely basis, or at all, for our    regulated systems through the ratemaking process. Although we    can give no assurance, we may also be able to recover certain of    these costs from third parties that may be responsible, or    potentially responsible, for groundwater contamination. Changes    in water supply costs directly affect our    earnings.     The cost to obtain water for delivery to our customers varies    depending on the sources of supply, wholesale suppliers    prices and the quantity of water produced to supply customer    water usage. Our source of supply varies by operating district.    Certain districts obtain all of their supply from wells, some    districts purchase all of the supply from wholesale suppliers    and other districts obtain the supply from a combination of well    and purchased sources. A portion of the supply is from surface    sources and processed through company-owned water treatment    plants. On average, slightly more than half of the water we    deliver to our customers is pumped from wells or received from a    surface supply with the remainder purchased from wholesale    suppliers. Water purchased from suppliers usually costs us more    than surface supplied or well pumped water. During 2006, the    cost of purchased water for delivery to    17Table of Contents    customers represented 31.7% of our total operating costs and in    2005 it represented 31.4% of our total operating costs.     Wholesale water suppliers may increase their prices for water    delivered to us based on factors that affect their operating    costs. Purchased water rate increases are beyond our control. In    California, our ability to recover increases in the cost of    purchased water is subject to decisions by the regulatory    commission. If we are not allowed to recover the higher costs,    our cash flows and our capital resources and liquidity can be    negatively affected. Also, our profit margins may be adversely    affected, unless the commissions allow us to seek reimbursement    of those costs from our customers.     Depending on the degree of heat and lack of rain, we may have to    purchase higher-cost water to meet customer demand. In such    circumstances, we may be unable to increase our rates in line    with the cost of our purchased water. Therefore, while our    revenues may increase, we may experience lower profit margins    during periods of peak demand. We    depend upon an adequate supply of electricity and certain    chemicals for the delivery of our water. An interruption in the    supply of these inputs or increases in their prices could    adversely affect our results of operations.     We rely on purchased electrical power in order to operate the    wells and pumps which are needed to supply water to our    customers. We have    back-up    power generators to operate a number of our wells and pumps in    emergencies, but an extended interruption in power supply could    impact our ability to continue to supply water. In the past,    California has been subjected to rolling power blackouts due to    insufficient power supplies. We can give no assurance that we    will not be subject to power blackouts in the future. In    addition, we require sufficient supplies of certain chemicals in    order to treat the water which we supply. There are multiple    suppliers of these chemicals, but if we were to suffer an    interruption of supply we might not be able to adequately treat    our water.     Purchased power expense represents electricity purchased to    operate the wells and pumps. Purchased power is a significant    operating expense. During 2006, purchased power expense    represented 7.7% of our total operating costs and in 2005 it    represented 7.4% of our total operating costs. These costs,    which are beyond our control, can and do increase unpredictably.    These costs can also increase in substantial amounts, as    occurred in California during 2001 when rates we paid for    electricity increased 48%. Cash flows between general rate case    filings and our earnings maybe adversely affected until the    commission authorizes a rate change. We are allowed to track the    expense differences caused by the rate change and request future    recovery, which is subject to an earnings test. Our    ability to generate new operating contracts is affected by local    politics.     Our revenue growth depends upon our ability to generate new as    well as to renew operating contracts with cities, other agencies    and municipal utility districts. Because we are selling our    services in a political environment, we are subject to changing    trends and municipal preferences. Recent terrorist acts have    affected some political viewpoints relative to outsourcing of    water or wastewater utility services. Municipalities own and    municipal employees operate the majority of water and wastewater    systems. A significant portion of our marketing and sales    efforts is spent demonstrating the benefits of contract    operations to elected officials and municipal authorities. The    existing political environment means that decisions are based on    many factors, not just economic factors. Our    business requires significant capital expenditures that are    dependent on our ability to secure appropriate funding. If we    are unable to obtain sufficient capital or if the rates at which    we borrow increase, there would be a negative impact on our    results of operations.     The water utility business is capital-intensive. We invest    significant funds to add or replace property, plant and    equipment. In addition, water shortages may adversely affect us    by causing us to rely on more purchased water. This could cause    increases in capital expenditures needed to build pipelines to    secure alternative water sources. In addition, we require    capital to grow our business through acquisitions. We fund our    capital requirements from cash received from operations and    funds received from developers. We seek to meet our long-term    capital needs by raising equity through common or preferred    stock issues or issuing debt obligations. We also borrow funds    from banks under short-term bank lending arrangements. We cannot    give any assurance that these sources will continue    18Table of Contents    to be adequate or that the cost of funds will remain at levels    permitting us to earn a reasonable rate of return. In the event    we are unable to obtain sufficient capital, our expansion    efforts could be curtailed, which may affect our growth and may    affect our future results of operations.     Our ability to access the capital markets is effected by the    ratings of certain of our debt securities. Moodys Investor    Services, Inc. and Standard & Poors Ratings    Services issue ratings on California Water Service    Companys ability to repay certain debt obligations. The    credit rating agencies could downgrade our credit rating based    on reviews of our financial performance and projections or upon    the occurrence of other events that could impact our business    outlook. Moodys current rating of California Water Service    Companys senior secured debt is A2 with a stable rating.    Standard & Poors rating is A+ with a stable    outlook. Lower ratings by the agencies could restrict our    ability to access equity and debt capital. We can give no    assurance that the rating agencies will maintain ratings which    allow us to borrow under advantageous conditions and at    reasonable interest rates. A future downgrade by the agencies    could also increase our cost of capital by causing potential    investors to require a higher interest rate due to a perceived    risk related to our ability to repay outstanding debt    obligations.     While the majority of our debt is long term at fixed rates, we    do have interest rate exposure in our short-term borrowings    which have variable interest rates. We are also subject to    interest rate risks on new financings. However, if interest    rates were to increase on a long-term basis, our management    believes that customer rates would increase accordingly, subject    to approval by the appropriate commission. We can give no    assurance that the commission will approve such an increase in    customer rates.     We are obligated to comply with specified debt covenants under    certain of our loan and debt agreements. Failure to maintain    compliance with these covenants could limit future borrowing,    and we could face increased borrowing costs, litigation,    acceleration of maturity schedules, and cross default issues.    Such actions by our creditors could have a material adverse    effect on our results of operations. We are    a holding company that depends on cash flow from our    subsidiaries to meet our obligations and to pay dividends on our    preferred stock and common stock.     As a holding company, we conduct substantially all of our    operations through our subsidiaries and our only significant    assets are investments in those subsidiaries. More than 95% of    our revenues are derived from the operations of California Water    Service Company. As a result, we are dependent on cash flow from    our subsidiaries, and California Water Service Company in    particular, to meet our obligations and to pay dividends on our    common stock.     We can make dividend payments only from our surplus (the excess,    if any, of our net assets over total paid-in capital) or if    there is no surplus, the net profits for the current fiscal year    or the fiscal year before which the dividend is declared. In    addition, we can pay cash dividends only if after paying those    dividends we would be able to pay our liabilities as they become    due. Owners of our capital stock cannot force us to pay    dividends and dividends will only be paid if and when declared    by our board of directors. Our board of directors can elect at    any time, and for an indefinite duration, not to declare    dividends on our capital stock.     Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and    generally have no obligation to pay any amounts due on    California Water Service Groups debt or to provide    California Water Service Group with funds for dividends.    Moreover, our subsidiaries are obligated to give first priority    to their own capital requirements and to maintain a capital    structure consistent with that determined to be reasonable by    the relevant commissions in their most recent decisions on    capital structure in order that ratepayers not be adversely    affected by the holding company structure. Furthermore, our    right to receive cash or other assets upon the liquidation or    reorganization of a subsidiary is generally subject to the prior    claims of creditors of that subsidiary. If we are unable to    obtain funds from our subsidiaries in a timely manner we may be    unable to meet our obligations or pay dividends.    19Table of Contents An    important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition of    water and wastewater systems, including pursuant to operating    agreements. Risks associated with potential acquisitions,    divestitures or restructurings may adversely affect    us.     We may seek to acquire or invest in other companies,    technologies, services or products that complement our business.    The execution of our growth strategy may expose us to different    risks than those associated with our utility operations. We can    give no assurance that we will succeed in finding attractive    acquisition candidates or investments, or that we would be able    to reach mutually agreeable terms with such parties. In    addition, as consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water    and wastewater industries, the prices for suitable acquisition    candidates may increase to unacceptable levels and limit our    ability to grow through acquisitions. If we are unable to find    acquisition candidates or investments, our ability to grow may    be limited.     Acquisition and investment transactions may result in the    issuance of our equity securities that could be dilutive if the    acquisition or business opportunity does not develop in    accordance with our business plan. They may also result in    significant write-offs and an increase in our debt. The    occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse    effect on our business, financial condition and results of    operations.     Any of these transactions could involve numerous additional    risks. For example, we may incur one or more of the following:           problems integrating the acquired operations, personnel,    technologies or products with our existing businesses and    products;           diversion of management time and attention from our core    business to the acquired business;           failure to retain key technical, management, sales and other    personnel of the acquired business;           difficulty in retaining relationships with suppliers and    customers of the acquired business; and           difficulty in getting required regulatory approvals.     In addition, the businesses and other assets we acquire may not    achieve the sales and profitability expected. The occurrence of    one or more of these events may have a material adverse effect    on our business. There can be no assurance that we will be    successful in overcoming these or any other significant risks    encountered. We may    not be able to increase or sustain our recent growth rate, and    we may not be able to manage our future growth    effectively.     We may be unable to continue to expand our business or manage    future growth. To successfully manage our growth and handle the    responsibilities of being a public company, we believe we must    effectively:           hire, train, integrate and manage additional qualified engineers    for research and development activities, sales and marketing    personnel, and financial and information technology personnel;           retain key management and augment our management team;           implement and improve additional and existing administrative,    financial and operations systems, procedures and controls;           expand and upgrade our technological capabilities; and           manage multiple relationships with our customers, regulators,    suppliers and other third parties.     If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be    able to take advantage of market opportunities, satisfy customer    requirements, execute our business plan or respond to    competitive pressures.    20Table of Contents We    have a number of large-volume commercial and industrial    customers and a significant decrease in consumption by one or    more of these customers could have an adverse effect on our    operating results and cash flows.     Our revenues will decrease, and such decrease may be material,    if a significant business or industrial customer terminates or    materially reduces its use of our water. Approximately    $76.7 million, or 23% of our 2006 water utility revenues    was derived from business and industrial customers. If any of    our large business or industrial customers reduces or ceases its    consumption of our water, we may seek commission approval to    increase the rates of our remaining customers to offset    decreased revenues. There can be no assurance, however, that the    commission would approve such a rate relief request, and even if    it did approve such a request, it would not apply retroactively    to the date of the reduction in consumption. The delay between    such date and the effective date of the rate relief may be    significant and could adversely affect our operating results and    cash flows. Our    operating cost and costs of providing services may rise faster    than our revenues.     Our ability to increase rates over time is dependent upon    approval of such rate increases by state commissions, which may    be inclined, for political or other reasons, to limit rate    increases. However, our costs are subject to market conditions    and other factors, which may increase significantly. The second    largest component of our operating costs after water production    is made up of salaries and wages. These costs are affected by    the local supply and demand for qualified labor. Other large    components of our costs are general insurance, workers    compensation insurance, employee benefits and health insurance    costs. These costs may increase disproportionately to rate    increases authorized by state commissions and may have a    material adverse effect on our future results of operations. Our    non-regulated business operates in a competitive    market.     While a majority of our business is regulated, our non-regulated    business participates in a competitive market. We compete with    several larger companies whose size, financial resources,    customer base and technical expertise may restrict our ability    to compete successfully for certain operations and maintenance    contracts. Due to the nature of our contract operations    business, and to the very competitive nature of the market, we    must accurately estimate the cost and profitability of each    project while, at the same time, maintaining prices at a level    low enough to compete with other companies. Our inability to    achieve this balance could adversely impact our results of    operations. Demand    for our stock may fluctuate due to circumstances beyond our    control.     We believe that stockholders invest in public utility stocks, in    part, because they seek reliable dividend payments. If there is    an over-supply of stock of public utilities in the market    relative to demand by such investors, the trading price of our    securities could decrease. Additionally, if interest rates rise    above the dividend yield offered by our equity securities,    demand for our stock, and consequently its market price, may    also decrease. Work    stoppages and other labor relations matters could adversely    affect our operating results.     At December 31, 2006, 577 of our 869 total employees were    union employees. In October 2005 and January 2006, we negotiated    two-year agreements with both unions. Improvements in tuition    reimbursement, increase in 401k employees contributions, and    wage increases were part of the agreement. Wage increases under    the agreements were 3.5% for 2006. Wages for 2007 were    negotiated in October 2006 with a general increase of 4%, plus    an annual increase of $1,300. The agreement also called for    employees to pay an increased premium for medical insurance    coverage.     We believe our labor relations are good, but in light of rising    costs for healthcare and pensions, contract negotiations in the    future may be difficult. We are subject to a risk of work    stoppages and other labor relations matters as we negotiate with    the unions to address these issues, which could affect our    results of operations and financial condition. We can give no    assurance that issues with our labor forces will be resolved    favorably to us in the future or that we will not experience    work stoppages.    21Table of Contents We    depend significantly on the services of the members of our    management team, and the departure of any of those persons could    cause our operating results to suffer.     Our success depends significantly on the continued individual    and collective contributions of our management team. The loss of    the services of any member of our management team could have a    material adverse effect on our business as our management team    has knowledge of our industry and customers and would be    difficult to replace. Our    operations are geographically concentrated in California and    this lack of diversification may negatively impact our    operations.     Although we own facilities in a number of states, over 95% of    operations are located in California. As a result, we are    largely subject to weather, political, water supply, labor,    utility cost, regulatory and economic risks affecting California.     We are also affected by the real property market in California.    In order to grow our business, we may need to acquire additional    real estate or rights to use real property owned by third    parties, the cost of which tends to be higher in California    relative to other states. The value of our assets in California    may decline if there is a decline in the California real estate    market which results in a significant decrease in real property    values. The    effects of natural disasters, terrorist activity, pandemics, or    poor water quality or contamination to our water supply may    result in disruption in our services and litigation which could    adversely affect our business, operating results and financial    condition.     We operate in areas that are prone to earthquakes, fires,    mudslides and other natural disasters. A significant seismic    event in California, where our operations are concentrated, or    other natural disaster in California could adversely impact our    ability to deliver water and adversely affect our costs of    operations. A major disaster could damage or destroy substantial    capital assets. The California Public Utilities Commission has    historically allowed utilities to establish a catastrophic event    memorandum account as another possible mechanism to recover    costs.     Our water supplies are subject to contamination, including    contamination from the development of naturally-occurring    compounds, chemicals in groundwater systems, pollution resulting    from man-made sources, such as MTBE, sea water incursion and    possible terrorist attacks. If our water supply is contaminated,    we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we    are able to substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated    water source. In addition, we may incur significant costs in    order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our    current treatment facilities, or development of new treatment    methods. If we are unable to substitute water supply from an    uncontaminated water source, or to adequately treat the    contaminated water source in a cost-effective manner, there may    be an adverse effect on our revenues, operating results and    financial condition. The costs we incur to decontaminate a water    source or an underground water system could be significant and    could adversely affect our business, operating results and    financial condition and may not be recoverable in rates. We    could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human    exposure to hazardous substances in our water supplies or other    environmental damage. For example, private plaintiffs have the    right to bring personal injury or other toxic tort claims    arising from the presence of hazardous substances in our    drinking water supplies. Our insurance policies may not be    sufficient to cover the costs of these claims.     We operate a dam. If the dam were to fail for any reason, we    would lose a water supply and flooding likely would occur.    Whether or not we were responsible for the dams failure,    we could be sued. We can give no assurance that we would be able    to successfully defend such a suit.     In light of the threats to the nations health and security    ensuing in the wake of the September 11, 2001, we have    taken steps to increase security measures at our facilities and    heighten employee awareness of threats to our water supply. We    have also tightened our security measures regarding the delivery    and handling of certain chemicals used in our business. We have    and will continue to bear increased costs for security    precautions to protect our facilities, operations and supplies.    These costs may be significant. Despite these tightened security    measures, we may not be in a position to control the outcome of    terrorist events should they occur.    22Table of Contents     We depend upon our skilled and trained work force to ensure    water delivery. Were a pandemic to occur, we can give no    assurance that we would be able to maintain sufficient manpower    to ensure uninterrupted service in all of the districts that we    serve. We    retain certain risks not covered by our insurance    policies.     We evaluate our risks and insurance coverage annually. Our    evaluation considers the costs, risks and benefits of retaining    versus insuring various risks as well as the availability of    certain types of insurance coverage. In addition, portions of    our business are difficult or impracticable to insure.    Furthermore, we are also affected by increases in prices for    insurance coverage; in particular, we have been, and will    continue to be, affected by rising health insurance costs.    Retained risks are associated with deductible limits, partial    self-insurance programs and insurance policy coverage ceilings.    If we suffer an uninsured loss, we may be unable to pass all, or    any portion, of the loss on to customers because our rates are    regulated by regulatory commissions. Consequently, uninsured    losses may negatively affect our financial condition, liquidity    and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we    will not face uninsured losses pertaining to the risks we have    retained. We    rely on our information technology and a number of complex    business systems that could malfunction and result in negative    impacts on our profitability and cash flow.     Our business is dependent on several complex business systems,    certain of which are owned by third parties. The business    systems must function reliably in order for us to operate    effectively. Among other things, system malfunctions and    security breaches could prevent us from operating or monitoring    our facilities, billing accurately and timely analyzing    financial results. Our profitability and cash flow could be    affected negatively in the event these systems do not operate    effectively or are circumvented. The    accuracy of our judgments and estimates about financial and    accounting matters will impact our operating results and    financial condition.     We make certain estimates and judgments in preparing our    financial statements regarding, among others:           the useful life of intangible rights;           the number of years to depreciate certain assets;           amounts to set aside for uncollectible accounts receivable,    inventory obsolesces and uninsured losses;           our legal exposure and the appropriate accrual for claims,    including medical claims and workers compensation claims;           future costs for pensions and other post-retirement    benefits; and           possible tax allowances.     The quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments will    have an impact on our operating results and financial condition.     In addition, we must estimate unbilled revenues and costs as of    the end of each accounting period. If our estimates are not    accurate, we will be required to make an adjustment in a future    period. Accounting rules permit us to use expense balancing    accounts and memorandum accounts that include input cost changes    to us that are different from amounts incorporated into the    rates approved by the commissions. These accounts result in    expenses and revenues being recognized in periods other than in    which they occurred. Our    controls and procedures may fail or be    circumvented.     Management regularly reviews and updates our internal control    over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures,    and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of    controls and procedures, however well designed and operated, is    based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only    reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the    system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and    procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to    controls and procedures could result in lack of    23Table of Contents    compliance with contractual agreements, misstatements in our    financial statements in amounts that could be material or could    cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial    information, which could have a negative effect on the trading    price of our stock and may negatively affect our ability raise    future capital.     Further, if we or our independent registered public accounting    firm discover a material weakness, the disclosure of that fact,    even if quickly remedied, could reduce the markets    confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price.    In addition, non-compliance with Section 404 of the    Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could subject us to a variety of    administrative sanctions, including the suspension or delisting    of our common stock from the New York Stock Exchange and the    inability of registered broker-dealers to make a market in our    common stock, which would further reduce our stock price. Municipalities,    water districts and other public agencies may condemn our    property by eminent domain action.     State statutes allow municipalities, water districts and other    public agencies to own and operate water systems. These agencies    are empowered to condemn properties already operated by    privately owned public utilities. However, whenever a public    agency constructs facilities to extend a utility system into the    service area of a privately owned public utility, such an act    constitutes the taking of property and requires reimbursement to    the utility for its loss. If a public agency were to acquire our    utility property by eminent domain action, we would be entitled    to just compensation for our loss, but we would no longer have    access to the condemned property nor would we be entitled to any    portion of revenue generated from the use of such asset going    forward. "
