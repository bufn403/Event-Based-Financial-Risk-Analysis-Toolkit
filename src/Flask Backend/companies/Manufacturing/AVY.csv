16,AVY,AVERY DENNISON CORP,2024-02-21,"    RISK FACTORSThe risk factors described in this section could materially adversely affect our business, including our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and cause the value of our securities to decline. This list of risks is not exhaustive. Our ability to attain our goals and objectives is dependent on numerous factors and risks, including, but not limited to, the most significant ones described in this section. Risk Related to Our International Operations The demand for our products is impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic, social, political and market conditions, which have had in the past and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business.We have operations in more than 50 countries and our domestic and international operations are strongly influenced by matters beyond our control, including changes in political, social, economic and labor conditions (including governmental shutdowns), tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign earnings), and international trade regulations (including tariffs), as well as the impact these changes have on demand for our products. In 2023, approximately 69% of our net sales were from international operations.Macroeconomic developments such as impacts from slower growth in geographic regions in which we operate; inflation; raw material, freight and labor availability and cost; energy costs; political, social, supply chain and other disruptions; epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks of illness, disease or virus; and uncertainty in the global credit or financial markets leading to a loss of consumer confidence could result in a material adverse effect on our business as a result of, among other things, lower consumer spending, reduced asset valuations, diminished liquidity and credit availability, volatility in securities prices, credit rating downgrades and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.Tensions remain in relations between the U.S. and China. In recent years, the U.S. government imposed or increased tariffs on various products imported into the U.S. from China. This has resulted in reciprocal tariffs on goods imported from the U.S. into China. The impacts on our operations to date have not been significant. However, our business could be significantly impacted if additional tariffs or other restrictions are imposed on products. These actions or other developments in international trade relations could have a material adverse effect on our business.In addition, business and operational disruptions or delays caused by political, social or economic instability and unrest – such as recent civil, political and economic disturbances in Argentina, Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Iran, Turkey, North Korea, Hong Kong and Sri Lanka and the related impact on global stability, the Russia-Ukraine war, the Israel-Hamas war, terrorist attacks and the potential for other hostilities or natural disasters in various parts of the world – could contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that could have a material adverse effect on our business. The Russia-Ukraine war that began in February 2022 continued in 2023 and we maintained our position of not shipping products for the Russian market throughout the year. The impact of the continuing war and our exit from our Russia-related business, as well as any further retaliatory actions taken by Russia, the U.S., the European Union and other jurisdictions, is unknown and could have a material adverse effect on our business. In October 2023, the war between Israel and Hamas began. Our sales in Israel in 2022 were less than 1% of our total net sales and have declined since the beginning of the war. We have experienced some disruptions in our operations in Israel and implemented plans to address these disruptions, which included sourcing production from alternative locations while focusing on the continued safety of our Israeli employees and their families. The impact of this war and any related hostilities in the Middle East region or elsewhere is unknown and could have a material adverse effect on our business.We are not able to predict the duration and severity of adverse economic, social, political or market conditions in the U.S. or other countries.Foreign currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in those rates, may materially adversely affects our business. The substantial majority of our net sales in 2023 was in foreign currencies. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates, such as those associated with the Argentine peso and Chinese renminbi which had unfavorable impacts in 2023, may result in a variety of negative effects, including lower net sales, increased costs, lower gross margin percentages, increased allowance for credit losses and/or write-offs of accounts receivable, and required recognition of impairments of capitalized assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets. Foreign currency translation decreased our net sales in 2023 by approximately $58 million compared to the prior year. We monitor our foreign currency exposures and may use hedging instruments to mitigate transactional exposure to changes in foreign currencies. The effectiveness of our hedges in part depends on our ability to accurately forecast our future cash flows, which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile foreign currency exchange rates. Our hedging activities may offset only a portion, or none at all, of the material adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place and we may incur significant losses from these activities.7Table of ContentsOur strategy includes increased growth in emerging markets, including China, which creates greater exposure to unstable political conditions, civil unrest, economic volatility, contagious disease and other risks applicable to international operations. A significant amount of our net sales – approximately 40% in 2023 – originated in emerging markets, which includes countries in Asia Pacific, Latin America, Eastern Europe and Middle East/Northern Africa. The profitable growth of our business in emerging markets is a significant focus of our long-term growth strategy and our regional results have and can fluctuate significantly based on their economic conditions. Our business operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the current and future political environment in China, including as a result of its response to tariffs imposed by the U.S. government on goods imported from China, tariffs imposed by China on U.S. goods, the increasing use of economic sanctions and export control restrictions, any trade agreements entered into between the U.S. and China, and tensions related to Hong Kong and Taiwan. Our ability to operate in China or other emerging markets has been and may continue to be adversely affected by changes in the laws and regulations of these jurisdictions or their interpretation thereof, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, raw materials, environmental regulations, land use rights, property, foreign currency conversion, the regulation of private enterprises and other matters. Epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks of illness, disease or virus and other adverse developments in emerging markets materially adversely affected our business at various times during the 2020-2023 period. There have been and could be further disruptions in our supply chain or ability to manufacture our products, as well as temporary closures of our facilities or those of our suppliers or customers, which have impacted and could in the future impact our sales and operating results.If we are unable to successfully expand our business in emerging markets or achieve the return on capital we expect from our investments in these countries, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected. In addition to the risks applicable to our international operations, factors that have negatively impacted our operations in these emerging markets from time to time include the less established or reliable legal systems and possible disruptions due to unstable political conditions, civil unrest or economic volatility. These factors can have a material adverse effect on our business in the affected markets by decreasing consumer purchasing power, reducing demand for our products or increasing our costs. Our operations and activities outside of the U.S. subjects us to risks different from and potentially greater than those associated with our domestic operations. A substantial portion of our employees and assets are located outside of the U.S. and, in 2023, approximately 69% of our sales was generated outside of the U.S. International operations and activities involve risks that are different from and potentially greater than the risks we face in our domestic operations, including changes in foreign political, regulatory and economic conditions, whether nationally, regionally or locally; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; inflation; reduced protection of intellectual property rights; laws and regulations impacting the ability to repatriate foreign earnings; challenges complying with foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to sales, operations, taxes, employment and legal proceedings; establishing effective controls and procedures to monitor compliance with U.S. laws and regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign laws and regulations, such as the UK’s Bribery Act of 2010; differences in lending practices; challenges with complying with applicable export and import control laws and regulations; and differences in language, culture and time zone. Risks Related to Our Business As a manufacturer, our sales and profitability depend upon the availability and cost of raw materials and energy, which are subject to price fluctuations, and our ability to control or offset increases in raw material and labor costs. Raw material and freight cost increases have impacted our business. The markets for the raw materials used in our businesses are challenging and can be volatile, impacting raw material availability and pricing. Additionally, energy costs can be volatile and unpredictable. Shortages and inflationary or other increases in the costs of raw materials, labor, freight and energy have occurred in the past, and could recur. In 2021 and 2022, we implemented targeted price increases in our Materials Group reportable segment to address raw material inflation, which began moderating in 2023. If we experience inflationary headwinds in the future, we may implement similar pricing measures. Our performance depends in part on our ability to offset increased raw material costs by raising our selling prices or re-engineering our products.It is also important for us to obtain timely delivery of materials, equipment, and other resources from suppliers, and to make timely delivery to customers. We may experience supply chain disruptions due to natural and other disasters or other events, or our existing relationships with suppliers could deteriorate or end in the future. Any such disruption in our supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability, and any sustained inability to obtain adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on our business.8Table of ContentsWe are affected by changes in our markets due to competitive conditions, technological developments, laws and regulations, and customer preferences. If we do not compete effectively or respond appropriately to these changes, it could reduce market demand, or we could lose market share or reduce our selling prices to maintain market share, any of which could materially adversely affect our business. We face the risk that existing or new competitors, which include some of our customers, distributors, and suppliers, will expand in our key market segments or develop new technologies, enhancing their competitive position relative to ours. Competitors also may be able to offer additional products, services, lower prices or other incentives that we cannot or that, to maintain profitability, we may not be able to offer. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or new technologies.We also are exposed to changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases, which may be affected by announced price increases, changes in our customer incentive programs, or changes in the customer’s ability to achieve incentive targets. Changes in customers’ preferences for our products can also affect demand for our products and a decline in demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our business. In our Materials Group reportable segment, as supply chain constraints eased in 2022, customers increased inventory levels following a period of reduced availability. In the fourth quarter of 2022, inventories downstream from our company began to unwind swiftly, resulting in lower demand. This continued in 2023, with volume improving sequentially throughout the year.We are affected by changes in our markets due to increasing environmental standards. If we do not respond appropriately to these changes, it could negatively impact market demand, our market share and pricing, any of which could materially adversely affect our business. Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, including those related to the impacts of climate change, adversely affect our business. A substantial amount of our label materials is sold for use in plastic packaging in the food, beverage, and home and personal care market segments. In recent years, there has been an accelerated focus on sustainability and transparency in sustainability reporting, with greater concern regarding climate change and single-use plastics, corporate commitments and increasing stakeholder expectations regarding the reuse and recyclability of plastic packaging and recycled content, and increased regulation in multiple geographies regarding the collection, recycling and use of recycled content. Changes in consumer preferences and laws and regulations related to the use of plastics reduces demand for certain of our products but also has the potential to increase demand for our more sustainable products. We have established a strategic innovation platform, among other things, focused on material circularity and waste elimination/reduction to develop products and solutions that advance the circular economy and address the need for increased recyclability of plastic packaging, in collaboration with our customers and the businesses in our supply chain. We have made considerable investments in our sustainability-driven products, but there can be no assurance that they will be successful, and a significant reduction in the use of plastic packaging could materially adversely affect demand for our products. The scientific consensus is that the emission of greenhouse gases (“GHG”) is altering our atmosphere in ways that are adversely affecting global climate. There is continuing concern from members of the scientific community and the general public that GHG emissions and other human activities have or will cause significant changes in weather patterns and increase the frequency or severity of extreme weather events, including droughts, wildfires and flooding. These types of extreme weather events have and may continue to adversely impact us, our suppliers, our customers and their ability to purchase our products and our ability to timely receive appropriate raw materials to manufacture and transport our products on a timely basis. Concern regarding climate change has led and is likely to continue leading to increasing demands by legislators and regulators, customers, consumers, investors, employees and non-governmental organizations for companies to reduce their GHG emissions. One of our 2025 sustainability goals is to achieve at least a 3% absolute reduction in our GHG emissions year-over-year and at least a 26% absolute reduction compared to our 2015 baseline by 2025; we have already exceeded the cumulative 2025 GHG emissions reduction goal. As part of our more ambitious 2030 sustainability goals, we are aiming by 2030 to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 70% compared to our 2015 baseline and work with our supply chain to reduce Scope 3 GHG emissions by 30% against our 2018 baseline; we also have an ambition to be net zero by 2050. We could face risks to our reputation, investor confidence and market share if we are unable to continue reducing our GHG emissions. Increased raw material costs, such as for fuel and electricity, and compliance-related costs could also impact customer demand for our products. The extent of the impact of climate change on our business is uncertain, as it will depend on the limits imposed by, and timing of, new or stricter laws and regulations, more stringent environmental standards and expectations, and evolving customer and consumer preferences, but it is likely to increase our costs and could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have recently acquired companies and are likely to acquire other companies. Acquisitions come with significant risks and uncertainties, including those related to integration, technology and employees. To grow existing businesses and expand into new areas, we have made acquisitions and are likely to continue acquiring companies that increase our presence in high value product categories, increase our pace of innovation and advance our sustainability priorities. In 2023, we acquired Silver Crystal, Lion Brothers and Thermopatch for aggregate purchase consideration of approximately $231 million. In 2022, we acquired TexTrace and Rietveld for aggregate purchase consideration approximately $35 million. The success of any acquisition depends on the ability of the combined company to realize the anticipated benefits from combining our businesses. Realizing these benefits depends, in part, on maintaining adequate focus on executing the business strategies of the combined company as well as the successful integration of 9Table of Contentsassets, operations, functions and personnel. We continue to evaluate potential acquisition targets and ensure we have a robust pipeline of potential opportunities. Various risks, uncertainties and costs are associated with acquisitions. Effective integration of systems, controls, employees, product lines, market segments, customers, suppliers and production facilities and cost savings can be difficult to achieve and the success of integration activities can be uncertain. While we have not experienced significant issues with our acquisitions to date, if management of our combined company is unable to continue minimizing the potential disruption of the combined company’s ongoing business during the integration process, the anticipated benefits of any acquisition may not be fully realized. In addition, the inability to successfully manage the implementation of appropriate systems, policies, benefits and compliance programs for the combined company could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may not be able to retain key employees of an acquired company or achieve the projected performance targets for the business into which an acquired company is integrated. Both before and after the closing of an acquisition, our business and that of the acquired company may suffer due to uncertainty or diversion of management attention. Future acquisitions could result in increased debt, dilution, liabilities, interest expense, restructuring charges and amortization expenses related to intangible assets. There can be no assurance that acquisitions will be successful and contribute to our profitability. Further, we may not be able to identify value-accretive acquisition targets that support our strategy of expanding our position in high value product categories or be able to successfully execute additional acquisitions in the future. A significant consolidation of our customer base could negatively impact our business. A significant consolidation of our customer base could negatively impact our business. In recent years, some converter customers served by our Materials Group reportable segment have consolidated and integrated vertically and some of our largest customers have acquired companies with similar or complementary product lines. Industry consolidation could continue to increase the concentration of our business with our largest customers. Further consolidation may be accompanied by pressure from customers for us to lower our selling prices. While we have been generally successful at managing customer consolidations in the past, increased pricing pressures from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business. Because some of our products are sold by third parties, our business depends in part on the financial condition of these parties and their customers. Some of our products are sold not only by us, but also by third-party distributors. Some of our distributors also market products that compete with our products. Changes in the financial or business conditions, including economic weakness, market trends or industry consolidation, or the purchasing decisions of these distributors or their customers could materially adversely affect our business. Our reputation, sales, and earnings could be materially adversely affected if the quality of our products and services does not meet customer expectations. In addition, product liability claims or regulatory actions could materially adversely affect our business and reputation. There are times when we experience product quality issues resulting from defective materials, manufacturing, packaging or design. These issues are often discovered before shipping, causing delays in shipping, delays in the manufacturing process, or, occasionally, cancelled orders. When issues are discovered after shipment, they may result in additional shipping costs, discounts, refunds or loss of future sales. Both pre-shipping and post-shipping quality issues could have a material adverse effect on our business and negatively impact our reputation. Claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of our products arise in the ordinary course of our business. In addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments and penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our business, product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity, reputational harm and loss of brand value. We also could be required to recall and possibly discontinue the sale of products deemed to be defective or unsafe, which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses. Although we maintain product liability insurance coverage, claims are subject to a deductible or may not be covered under the terms of the policy. Changes in our business strategies and the restructuring of our operations affect our costs and the profitability of our businesses. In addition, our profitability may be materially adversely affected if we generate less productivity improvement from our restructuring actions than projected. As our business environment changes, we have adjusted and may need to further adjust our business strategies or restructure our operations or particular businesses. As we continue to develop and adjust our growth strategies, we may invest in new businesses that have short-term returns that are negative or low and whose ultimate business prospects are uncertain or could prove unprofitable. We engage in restructuring actions from time to time to reduce our costs and increase efficiencies across our business segments. We expended approximately $79 million in 2023 compared to $8 million for restructuring actions in 2022. Our restructuring actions in 2023 included a restructuring plan to further optimize the European footprint of our Materials Group reportable segment. We had incremental savings from restructuring actions, net of transition costs, of approximately $69 million in fiscal year 2023. We intend to continue efforts to reduce costs in all our businesses, which have in the past included, and may continue to include, facility closures and square footage reductions, headcount reductions, organizational restructuring, process standardization, and manufacturing relocation. The success of these efforts is not assured and targeted savings may not be realized. In addition, cost reduction actions can result in restructuring charges and could expose us to production risk, loss of sales and employee turnover. We cannot provide assurance that we 10Table of Contentswill achieve the intended results of any of our restructuring actions, which involve operational complexities, consume management attention and require substantial resources and effort. If we fail to achieve the intended results of such actions, our costs could increase, our assets could be impaired, and our returns on investments could be lower. Our ability to develop and successfully market new products and applications impacts our competitive position. The timely introduction of new products and improvements to current products helps determine our success. Many of our current products are the result of our research and development efforts, for which we expensed $135.8 million in 2023. These efforts are directed primarily toward developing new products and operating techniques and improving product performance, often in close association with our customers or end users. These efforts include patent and product development work relating to printing and coating technologies, as well as adhesive, release and ink chemistries in Materials Group. We focus on research projects related to RFID and external embellishments in Solutions Group, for which we have and license a number of patents. Additionally, our research and development efforts include sustainable innovation and design of products that increase the use of recycled content, reduce waste, extend life or enable recycling. Research and development is complex and uncertain, requiring innovation and anticipation of market trends, which means that the costs of these expenditures may not be recovered through additional sales. We could focus on products that ultimately are not accepted by customers or end users or we could experience delays in the production or launch of new products could compromise our competitive position. Our infrastructure needs impact our business and expenditures. We continue to invest in our long-term growth and margin expansion plans, with $285.1 million in capital expenditures, including fixed assets and information technology, in 2023. We may not be able to recoup the costs of our infrastructure investments if actual demand is not as we anticipate. In recent years, we expanded Materials Group’s manufacturing capabilities in India and a location in Indiana; moved our Solutions Group’s Vietnam business into a new, expanded facility; and made additional investments in both capacity and business development globally for our Intelligent Labels RFID platform, including new facilities in Brazil and Mexico. We also transferred Materials Group’s European medical capacity from Belgium to Ireland. In addition, we added capacity through our acquisitions of Silver Crystal, Lion Brothers and Thermopatch in 2023. Infrastructure investments, which are long-term in nature, may not generate the expected return due to changes in the marketplace, failures in execution, and other factors. Significant changes from our expected need for and/or returns on our infrastructure investments could materially adversely affect our business. Difficulty in the collection of receivables as a result of economic conditions or other market factors could have a material adverse effect on our business. Although we have processes to administer credit granted to customers and believe our allowance for credit losses is adequate, we have increased the allowance due to, for example, epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks of illness, supply chain challenges, issues with raw material availability and cost, freight and labor availability, and inflationary pressures, and in the future may experience losses as a result of our inability to collect some of our accounts receivable. A customer’s financial difficulties are likely to result in reduced business with that customer. We may also assume higher credit risk relating to receivables of a customer experiencing financial difficulty. If these developments were to occur widely in our customer base, our inability to collect on our accounts receivable from customers could substantially reduce our cash flows and income and have a material adverse effect on our business.There is a rapidly evolving awareness and focus from stakeholders, including our investors, customers and employees, with respect to global climate change and our company’s sustainability and governance practices, which could affect our business. Investor and societal expectations with respect to sustainability or governance matters have been evolving and increasing. We risk damage to our reputation if we do not continue to act responsibly with respect to these matters in the following key areas: environmental stewardship; DEI; corporate governance; support for our communities; and transparency. A failure to adequately meet stakeholders’ expectations could result in loss of business, diluted market valuation, an inability to attract and retain customers and personnel, increased negative investor sentiment toward us and/or our customers and the diversion of investment to other industries, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and access to and cost of capital.Epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks of illness, and restrictions intended to prevent their spread, could materially adversely impact our business. Epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks of illness, disease or virus in the markets in which we do business, and actions taken to contain or prevent their further spread, could materially impact our business, as they did at various times during the 2020-2023 period. They could result in restrictive governmental measures being implemented to control their spread, including quarantines, restrictions on travel, “shelter in place” rules, stay-at-home orders, density limitations, social distancing measures, and/or restrictions on types of business that may continue to operate, which could materially adversely affect our business. 11Table of ContentsRisks Related to Information Technology Significant disruption to the information technology infrastructure that stores our information could materially adversely affect our business. We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a large and complex information technology infrastructure to link our global business. Like all information technology systems, ours are susceptible to a number of risks including, but not limited to, damage or interruptions resulting from obsolescence, natural disasters, power failures, human error, viruses, social engineering, phishing, ransomware or other malicious attacks and data security breaches. We upgrade and install new systems, which, if installed or programmed incorrectly or on a delayed timeframe, could cause delays or cancellations of customer orders, impede the manufacture or shipment of products, or disrupt the processing of transactions. We have continued to implement measures to mitigate our risk related to system and network disruptions, but if a significant disruption were to occur, we could incur significant losses and remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business.Additionally, we rely on services provided by third-party vendors for certain information technology processes, including system infrastructure management, application management, and software as a service. While we have matured our cybersecurity due diligence process, this reliance on third parties makes our operations vulnerable to a failure by any one of these vendors to perform adequately or maintain effective internal controls. Cybersecurity or other security breaches could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation.We maintain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form, which is stored in data centers and on our networks and third-party cloud services, including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations. Data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering and theft. We develop and maintain systems and processes at significant cost to prevent this from occurring, but these systems require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. We experience non-material cybersecurity events each year that are escalated through our documented and tested Security Incident Response Plan, and although we have not experienced a significant breach in recent years, the possibility of intrusion, tampering and theft cannot be eliminated entirely. Our information technology and infrastructure are vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions, and the threat landscape remains challenging with our digital business transformation, hybrid workforces, the increasing use of artificial intelligence, and interconnected supply chains expanding the risk of attack. We also perform cybersecurity due diligence and mitigate identified risks during our M&A due diligence process; however, there is still a risk that a recent or future acquisition experiences an event that could lead to a breach before risks are able to be mitigated.Additionally, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business objectives. While we obtain written agreements and assurances that these third parties will protect this information and, where appropriate, assess the protections utilized by these third parties, we are aware of suppliers in our ecosystem who have experienced security events, and there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised. Breaches or attacks can compromise our network, the network of a third party to whom we have disclosed confidential, proprietary or personal information, a data center where we have stored such information or a third-party cloud service provider, and the information stored there can be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any access, disclosure or loss of information could disrupt our operations, result in legal claims or proceedings, damage our reputation, impair our ability to conduct business, or result in the loss or diminished value of profitable opportunities and the loss of revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property. Contractual provisions with third parties, including cloud service providers, often substantially limit our ability to fully recover our losses. If the personal information of our customers or employees were to be misappropriated, we could incur costs to compensate our customers or employees or pay damages or fines as a result of litigation or regulatory actions and our reputation with our customers and employees could be injured, resulting in loss of business or decline in morale. Data privacy legislation and regulation have been increasing in recent years – including, for example, the General Data Protection Regulation in the EU, the Personal Information Protection Law in China, the General Data Protection Law in Brazil and the state of California’s Privacy Rights Act – and although we have made reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to regulatory action in the event of a data privacy violation. Cybersecurity risk and ransomware attacks on companies continue to significantly increase and there can be no assurance that we have fully protected our information, that third parties to whom we have disclosed such information or with whom we have stored such information (in data centers and in the cloud) are taking similar precautions, or that we will not experience hacking or intrusion attempts that could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition to maintaining a robust set of endpoint, network, email and cloud security solutions, we continue to take steps to further improve the security of our networks and computer systems, including strengthening authentication; continuing to mature our zero trust architecture and strategy; furthering our advanced malware detection measures; further enhancing and testing our security incident response plan; upgrading legacy information technology systems to simplify and standardize business processes and applications; adopting a robust cloud security strategy across multiple platforms; continuously improving 12Table of Contentsinformation technology project and portfolio management discipline; setting more aggressive key performance indicator targets and implementing appropriate mitigation measures; continuing to mature our data loss prevention framework to protect our critical data, network and site access controls; advancing our user access management program; limiting USB drive access across our company; increasing network segmentation; enhancing our focus on third party risk management; and improving our capabilities based on threat intelligence and the publicized incidents experienced by other companies, as well as ones that we have experienced despite their minimal operational or financial impact to date.Risks Related to Income Taxes Changes in our tax rates affect our business. Our effective tax rate is affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation. The impact of these changes could materially impact our business.Legislation implementing changes in taxation of business activities, adoption of other corporate tax reform policies, or other changes in tax legislation or policies impact our expenses. Corporate tax reform, prevention of base-erosion and tax transparency continue to be high priorities for many tax jurisdictions worldwide, including the U.S. As a result, policies regarding corporate income and other taxes are under heightened scrutiny globally, with tax reform legislation having been proposed or enacted in a number of jurisdictions. In addition, many countries have enacted, or plan to enact, legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations and directives, which aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, cross-border tax, transfer-pricing documentation rules, and nexus-based tax incentive practices. Moreover, the OECD continues to focus on fundamental changes to the profit allocation among tax jurisdictions in which companies do business and the implementation of a global minimum tax. The timing and ultimate impact of such changes on our effective tax rate remain uncertain as the countries in which we operate continue to adopt these directives. Due to the size of our international business activities, any substantial change in corporate tax policies, enforcement activities or legislative or regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our inability to retain or renew certain tax incentives in foreign jurisdictions could materially adversely affect our effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate reflects benefits from concessionary tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions based on the geographic location of our manufacturing activities, the industries that we serve, or the business model under which we operate. If we do not meet the criteria required to retain or renew these tax incentives, our effective tax rate could be materially adversely affected. The amount of various taxes we pay is subject to ongoing compliance requirements and audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are subject to regular examinations of our income tax returns by various tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of material adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. In addition, tax enforcement has become increasingly aggressive in recent years focused primarily on transfer pricing and intercompany documentation. Our estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues requires significant judgment and is subject to our assessment of relevant risks, facts, and circumstances existing at the time. We use these assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and other tax-related accounts. Our results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved, which may materially adversely affect our effective tax rate. We have deferred tax assets that we may not be able to realize under certain circumstances. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in certain jurisdictions, or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. This would increase our effective tax rate and could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, changes in statutory tax rates may change our deferred tax asset or liability balances, with either a favorable or unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate. A significant portion of our indefinite-lived net operating loss carryforwards is concentrated in Luxembourg and may require decades to be fully utilized under our current business model. Decreases in the statutory tax rate or changes in our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in Luxembourg could materially adversely affect our effective tax rate. In addition, the computation and assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets may also be materially impacted by new legislation or regulations. 13Table of ContentsRisks Related to Human Capital For us to remain competitive, deliver on our business strategy and avoid business disruption, it is important to recruit high caliber talent, retain key management and highly-skilled employees and receive high quality service from all outsourced service providers. This includes providing market-competitive compensation and benefits and ensuring a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace.Competition to recruit and retain critical talent has increased in recent years. Our ongoing productivity efforts and restructuring actions can increase this challenge. When it comes to our outsourced service providers, we have experienced delays or errors and reduced resource availability and manage ongoing risk when it comes to people, processes and software. We also have increased our focus on risks related to artificial intelligence.Executive succession planning is also critical to our long-term success. We experienced several recent key management changes, including promotions in 2023 of long-serving and experienced leaders to the positions of President and Chief Executive Officer and our President, Solutions Group. While we believe we have appropriate leadership development programs and succession plans in place that are regularly discussed with our Board’s Talent and Compensation Committee, any failure to ensure effective leadership transitions and knowledge transfer involving key management (or any highly-skilled employees) could hinder our strategic planning and execution. We have various non-U.S. collective labor arrangements, which make us subject to potential work stoppages, as well as union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our business. Work interruptions or stoppages could significantly impact our ability to deliver for our customers. In addition, collective bargaining agreements, union contracts and labor laws may impair our ability to reduce labor costs by closing or downsizing manufacturing facilities because of limitations on personnel and salary and other restrictions. A work stoppage at one or more of our facilities, or the facilities of our customers or at any of our suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, the recent and ongoing geopolitical unrest and weather-related effects of climate change in numerous regions could impact the safety and productivity of our current employees. Those impacts could also hinder our ability to recruit and grow our talent pools in the impacted regions/countries.Risks Related to Our Indebtedness If our indebtedness increases significantly or our credit ratings are downgraded, we may have difficulty obtaining acceptable short- and long-term financing. At December 30, 2023, we had approximately $3.24 billion of debt. Our level of indebtedness and credit ratings are significant factors in our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing. Higher debt levels could negatively impact our ability to support our business needs and result in higher financing costs. The credit ratings assigned to us also impact the interest rates we pay. A downgrade of our short-term credit ratings could impact our ability to access the commercial paper markets and increase our borrowing costs if we needed to obtain short-term funding under our revolving credit facility. If our access to commercial paper markets were to become limited and we were required to obtain short-term funding under our revolving credit facility or our other credit facilities, we would have increased exposure to variable interest rates. An increase in interest rates adversely affects our business. In 2023, our average variable-rate borrowings were approximately $608 million. Increases in short-term interest rates directly impact the amount of interest we pay. Fluctuations in interest rates can increase our borrowing costs and have a material adverse effect on our business. Since 2022, the U.S. Federal Reserve and similar monetary policymaking entities around the world have raised interest rates in an effort to curb rising inflation across the globe. As of December 30, 2023, the U.S. Federal Reserve’s benchmark interest rate was between 5.25% and 5.50%, up from between 4.25% and 4.50% the same time in 2022. As long-term interest rates rise, our borrowing costs increase. Continued increases in interest rates could, among other things, reduce the availability and/or increase the costs of obtaining new debt and refinancing existing indebtedness and negatively impact our business. Our current and future debt covenants may limit our flexibility. Our credit facilities and the indentures governing our medium- and long-term notes contain, and any of our future indebtedness likely would contain, restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us. Among other things, these covenants restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, incur certain liens on our assets, make certain investments, sell our assets or merge with third parties, or enter into certain transactions. We are also required to maintain specified financial ratios under certain conditions. These restrictive covenants and ratios may limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain activities and transactions that may be in the best interest of our business, putting us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors, which could materially adversely affect our business.14Table of ContentsRisk Related to Ownership of Our Stock Our stock price is subject to significant variability. Changes in our stock price may, among other things, affect our access to, or cost of financing from, capital markets, our stock-based compensation arrangements and our effective tax rate. Our stock price is influenced by changes in the overall stock market and demand for equity securities in general. Other factors, including our financial performance on an absolute basis and relative to peer companies and competitors, as well as market expectations of our performance, the level of perceived growth of our industries, and other company-specific factors, may also materially adversely affect our stock price. There can be no assurance that our stock price will not continue to experience significant variability in the future. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to repurchase shares of our common stock or pay dividends on our common stock or that repurchases will enhance long-term stockholder value. Changes in our levels of stock repurchases or dividends could affect our stock price and increase its variability. In April 2022, our Board authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock with a fair market value of up to $750 million, in addition to the amount of shares that were then available for repurchase under our previous Board authorization. In 2023, we repurchased 0.8 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $137.5 million. As of December 30, 2023, shares of our common stock in the aggregate amount of $592.8 million remained authorized for repurchase under this Board authorization. We make share repurchases through a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades or accelerated share repurchase transactions. Our share repurchase authorizations do not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares or to repurchase any specific number of shares for any fixed period. The timing and amount of our repurchases, if any, are subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. We may limit, suspend or discontinue repurchasing shares at any time at our discretion and without prior notice. Although we increased our quarterly dividend rate by approximately 8% in April 2023, there can be no assurance that we will maintain this rate or approve further increases in the future. Future dividends are subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. We are not obligated to continue declaring dividends for any fixed period, and our payment of dividends could be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and without prior notice. We will continue to retain future earnings to develop our business, as opportunities arise, and evaluate the amount and timing of future dividends based on our operating results, financial condition, capital allocation strategies and general business conditions. The amount and timing of any future dividends may vary, and the payment of any dividend does not assure that we will pay dividends in the future. In addition, any future repurchases of our common stock or payment of dividends, or any determination to cease repurchasing stock or paying dividends, could affect our stock price and significantly increase its variability. Our share repurchases and any future dividends could cause our stock price to be higher than it would otherwise be and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Additionally, any future repurchases of our common stock or payment of dividends could impact our ability to invest in our businesses or pursue acquisitions and venture investments. Although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance that it will do so because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness. Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters Infringing intellectual property rights of third parties or inadequately acquiring or protecting our intellectual property could harm our ability to compete or grow. Because our products involve complex technology and chemistry, we are involved from time to time in litigation involving patents and other intellectual property. Parties have filed, and in the future may file, claims against us alleging that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We are currently party to a litigation in which ADASA Inc. (“Adasa”), an unrelated third party, alleged that certain of our RFID products within our Solutions Group reportable segment infringed its patent. As of December 30, 2023 our contingent liability for this matter was $82.9 million which reflects our best estimate of the anticipated judgment. For more information on this litigation, see Note 8, “Contingencies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. If we are unsuccessful in our appeals related to the Adasa matter or are held liable for infringement in other matters, we could be required to pay damages, obtain licenses or cease making or selling certain products. There can be no assurance that licenses would be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The defense of these claims, whether or not meritorious, or the development of new technologies is costly and diverts the attention of management. We also have valuable intellectual property upon which third parties may infringe. We attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual property and proprietary information by relying on the patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws of the U.S. and other countries, as well as non-disclosure agreements. However, it may be possible for a third party to obtain our information without our authorization, independently develop similar technologies, or breach a non-disclosure agreement entered into with us. In addition, many of the countries in which we operate do not have intellectual property laws as protective as those in the U.S. The use of our intellectual property by someone else without our authorization could reduce or eliminate certain competitive advantages we have, cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business. Further, the costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights could materially adversely impact our business. 15Table of ContentsWe have obtained and applied for U.S. and foreign trademark registrations and patents, and will continue to evaluate whether to register additional trademarks and apply for additional patents. We cannot guarantee that any of our pending applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities. Further, we cannot assure that the validity of our patents or our trademarks will not be challenged. In addition, third parties may be able to develop competing products using technology that avoids our patents. Unfavorable developments in legal proceedings, investigations and other legal and regulatory matters, could impact us in a materially adverse manner. There can be no assurance that any outcome of any litigation, investigation or other legal, environmental, compliance and regulatory matter will be favorable. Our financial results could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome to pending or future litigation and investigations, and other legal, regulatory, environmental and compliance matters. See Note 8, “Contingencies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. We are required to comply with anti-corruption and other compliance laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various international jurisdictions, and our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are required to comply with the anti-corruption and other compliance laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various international jurisdictions, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK’s Bribery Act of 2010. If we fail to comply with anti-corruption laws, we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties, including fines, monetary damages and incarceration for responsible employees and managers. In addition, if our distributors or agents fail to comply with these laws, our business may also be materially adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties. We are required to comply with environmental, health, and safety laws at our operations around the world. The costs of complying with these laws is significant and increasing. We are subject to national, state, provincial and/or local environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate, including those related to the disposal of hazardous waste and GHG emissions from our manufacturing processes. These laws, which are continually evolving and imposing additional requirements on our current and former manufacturing facilities, impose liability for the costs of, and damages resulting from, cleaning up current sites, past spills, disposals and other releases of hazardous substances. Enforcement of these laws can be unclear and is subject to the discretion of governmental agencies. Any failure to comply with existing and future environmental, health and safety laws could subject us to fees, penalties, costs or liabilities, impact our production capabilities, limit our ability to sell, expand or acquire facilities, and have a material adverse effect on our business. Laws and regulations related to the environment, product content and product safety are complex, change often, and can be open to different interpretations. In addition, we could be materially and adversely impacted by any environmental or product safety enforcement action affecting our suppliers, particularly in emerging markets. We have accrued liabilities for the environmental clean-up of certain sites, including the eleven sites for which U.S. governmental agencies have designated us as a potentially responsible party as of our 2023 fiscal year-end, where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. See Note 8, “Contingencies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. However, because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities, the actual expense to remediate currently identified sites could be higher than the liabilities accrued and additional sites could be identified in the future. We are subject to export and import control laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in these markets. Export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of some of our products to embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons. While we train our employees to comply with these regulations, use third party screening software, and take other measures, we cannot guarantee that a violation will not occur. A prohibited shipment has negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties, fines, civil and criminal sanctions and/or reputational harm. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could decrease our ability to export or sell our products internationally. Any limitation on our ability to export or sell our products could materially adversely affect our business. Some of our products are subject to export control laws and regulations and may be exported only with an export license or through an applicable export license exception. If we fail to comply with export licensing, customs regulations, economic sanctions or other laws, we could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including fines, criminal charges against responsible employees and loss of export or import privileges. In addition, if our distributors fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be materially adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties. Obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be time consuming and expensive and could result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. 16Table of ContentsRisks Related to Other Financial Matters Our pension assets are significant and subject to market, interest and credit risk that may reduce their value. Changes in the value of our pension assets, which was approximately $663 million as of December 30, 2023, could materially adversely affect our earnings and cash flows. In particular, the value of our investments may decline due to increases in interest rates or volatility in financial markets. We continuously evaluate options to better manage the volatility associated with our pension liabilities and may take actions to reduce the financial volatility associated with our pension liabilities, which could result in significant charges. Although we mitigate these risks by investing in high quality securities, ensuring adequate diversification of our investment portfolio and monitoring our portfolio’s overall risk profile, the value of our investments may nevertheless decline. The actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes affect our earnings and cash flows. Changes in accounting standards and government regulations could also affect our pension and postretirement plan expense and funding requirements. We evaluate the assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our non-U.S. pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans in consultation with outside actuaries. Our pension and projected postretirement benefit expenses and funding requirements increase or decrease as a result of the assumptions we use, including the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return or mortality rates. Because of changing market conditions or changes in participant populations, the actuarial assumptions that we use may differ from actual results, which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and related costs. Funding obligations for each plan are determined based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date in accordance with applicable government regulations. Our pension funding requirements, and the timing of funding payments, could also be affected by future legislation or regulation. In 2023, the Dutch Senate passed the Dutch Pension Act, which requires traditional defined benefit plans to be phased out and transition to defined contribution plans by January 1, 2028.An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our results of operations and net worth. Goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and not amortized and is reviewed for impairment annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators are present). As of December 30, 2023, the carrying value of our goodwill was $2.01 billion. In 2023, we determined that the goodwill of our reporting units was not impaired. We review goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. In assessing fair value, we make estimates and assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates, and discount rates based on our business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying these factors. Goodwill valuations have been calculated primarily using an income approach based on the present value of projected future cash flows of each reporting unit. We could be required to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to our business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines. These types of events could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future. Impairment charges could materially adversely affect our business in the periods in which they are made"
17,AVY,AVERY DENNISON CORP,2023-02-22,"    RISK FACTORSThe risk factors described in this section could materially adversely affect our business, including our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and cause the value of our securities to decline. This list of risks is not exhaustive. Our ability to attain our goals and objectives is dependent on numerous factors and risks, including, but not limited to, the most significant ones described in this section. Risk Related to Our International Operations The demand for our products is impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic, social, political and market conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.We have operations in over 50 countries and our domestic and international operations are strongly influenced by matters beyond our control, including changes in political, social, economic and labor conditions, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign earnings), and international trade regulations (including tariffs), as well as the impact of these changes on the underlying demand for our products. In 2022, approximately 72% of our net sales were from international operations. Macroeconomic developments such as impacts from slower growth in the geographic regions in which we operate; inflation; raw material, freight and labor availability; rising energy costs; political, social, supply chain and other disruptions; COVID-19; and uncertainty in the global credit or financial markets leading to a loss of consumer confidence could result in a material adverse effect on our business as a result of, among other things, reduced consumer spending, declines in asset valuations, diminished liquidity and credit availability, volatility in securities prices, credit rating downgrades and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.Tensions remain in relations between the U.S. and China. In recent years, the U.S. government imposed additional tariffs on products imported into the U.S. from China. This has resulted in reciprocal tariffs on goods imported from the U.S. 6Table of Contentsinto China. The impacts on our operations to date have not been significant. There remains risk that our business could be significantly impacted if additional tariffs or other restrictions are imposed on products. Any of these actions or further developments in international trade relations could have a material adverse effect on our business.In addition, business and operational disruptions or delays caused by political, social or economic instability and unrest – such as recent civil, political and economic disturbances in the U.S., Russia, Ukraine, Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, North Korea, Hong Kong and Sri Lanka and the related impact on global stability, terrorist attacks and the potential for other hostilities, public health crises or natural disasters in various parts of the world – could contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business. In February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine after which the U.S., Canada, the European Union and other countries imposed economic sanctions on Russia, Belarus and certain banks, companies and individuals affiliated with those countries. Russian military actions and the resulting sanctions could adversely affect the global economy and financial markets. In the second quarter of 2022, we ceased shipment of all products for the Russian market, where our sales in 2021 were approximately 1% of our net sales for that year, and we maintained that position throughout the year. The impact of these government measures and our exit from our Russia-related business, as well as any further retaliatory actions taken by Russia, the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions, is unknown and could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are not able to predict the duration and severity of adverse economic, social, political or market conditions in the U.S. or other countries.Foreign currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in those rates, may materially adversely affect our business. The substantial majority of our net sales in 2022 was in foreign currencies. Fluctuations in currencies, such as those associated with the euro and Chinese yuan in 2022, which had an unfavorable impact for the year, can result in a variety of negative effects, including lower net sales, increased costs, lower gross margin percentages, increased allowance for credit losses and/or write-offs of accounts receivable, and required recognition of impairments of capitalized assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets. Foreign currency translation decreased our net sales in 2022 by approximately $417 million. Margins on sales of our products in foreign countries could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We monitor our foreign currency exposures and may, from time to time, use hedging instruments to mitigate transactional exposure to changes in foreign currencies. The effectiveness of our hedges in part depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows, which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates. Further, hedging activities may offset only a portion, or none at all, of the material adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place and we may incur significant losses from hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility and foreign currency fluctuations. Our strategy includes increased growth in emerging markets, including China, which could create greater exposure to unstable political conditions, civil unrest, economic volatility, contagious disease and other risks applicable to international operations. A significant amount of our net sales – approximately 40% of our net sales in 2022 – originated in emerging markets, including countries in Asia Pacific, Latin America, Eastern Europe and Middle East/Northern Africa. The profitable growth of our business in emerging markets is a significant focus of our long-term growth strategy and our regional results have and can fluctuate significantly based on economic conditions in these regions. Our business operations have been and may be adversely affected by the current and future political environment in China, including as a result of its response to tariffs instituted by the U.S. government on goods imported from China, tariffs imposed by China on U.S. goods, the increasing use of economic sanctions and export control restrictions, any trade agreements entered into between the U.S. and China, and tensions related to Hong Kong and Taiwan. Our ability to operate in China or other emerging markets may be adversely affected by changes in the laws and regulations of these jurisdictions or the interpretation thereof, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, raw materials, environmental regulations, land use rights, property, foreign currency conversion, the regulation of private enterprises and other matters. In 2022, many of our manufacturing and other operations in China experienced limited production and/or closure amid governmental lockdown orders. All of our manufacturing facilities are currently open, but, some of our employees are still unable to travel easily within and outside their countries. The pandemic and other adverse developments in emerging markets could have a material adverse effect on our business. There have been and could be further disruptions in our supply chain or ability to manufacture our products, as well as temporary closures of our facilities or those of our suppliers or customers, any of which could impact our sales and operating results. In 2022, COVID-19 adversely affected global economies and financial markets primarily due to lockdowns in China, and any further escalation of the pandemic could lead to a more significant economic downturn that could adversely affect demand for our products and negatively impact our business. In 2021, with the spread of the Delta variant mid-year, we experienced intermittent COVID-19 closures in Southeast Asia, particularly in our Solutions Group reportable segment. If we are unable to successfully expand our business in emerging markets or achieve the return on capital we expect as a result of our investments in these countries, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected. In addition to the risks applicable to our international operations, factors that could negatively impact our operations in these emerging markets include the less established or reliable legal systems and possible disruptions due to unstable political 7Table of Contentsconditions, civil unrest or economic volatility. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business by decreasing consumer purchasing power, reducing demand for our products or increasing our costs. Our operations and activities outside of the U.S. may subject us to risks different from and potentially greater than those associated with our domestic operations. A substantial portion of our employees and assets are located outside of the U.S. and, in 2022, approximately 72% of our sales was generated outside of the U.S. International operations and activities involve risks that are different from and potentially greater than the risks we face with respect to our domestic operations; changes in foreign political, regulatory and economic conditions, including nationally, regionally and locally; changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies; inflation; reduced protection of intellectual property rights; laws and regulations impacting the ability to repatriate foreign earnings; challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to sales, operations, taxes, employment and legal proceedings; establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate our international operations and monitor compliance with U.S. laws and regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign laws and regulations, such as the UK’s Bribery Act of 2010; differences in lending practices; challenges with complying with applicable export and import control laws and regulations; and differences in language, culture and time zone. Risks Related to Our Business As a manufacturer, our sales and profitability depend upon the cost and availability of raw materials and energy, which are subject to price fluctuations, and our ability to control or offset increases in raw material and labor costs. Raw material and freight cost increases have impacted our business and could materially adversely affect our business. The availability of raw materials used in our businesses remained constrained in 2022, which continued to present challenges and lead to volatility, impacting availability and pricing. Additionally, energy costs continued to increase in 2022, particularly in Europe, and could remain volatile and unpredictable. Shortages and inflationary or other increases in the costs of raw materials, labor, freight and energy remained significant in 2022. We continued to implement targeted price increases across our businesses and regions and worked to re-engineer certain of our products, to address raw material and freight inflation. If inflation remains persistent in 2023, we may have to implement additional pricing measures. Our performance depends in part on our ability to offset cost increases for raw materials by raising our sales prices or re-engineering our products and our ability to maintain our sales prices if costs for raw materials decrease. It is important for us to obtain timely delivery of materials, equipment, and other resources from suppliers, and to make timely delivery to customers. In 2022, we experienced supply chain interruptions due to natural and other disasters which are becoming more frequent due to the impacts from climate change, or other events, such as COVID-19 in China and political and social unrest in Sri Lanka, energy shortages in multiple regions, and floods in Pakistan. We continued managing through the dynamic supply and demand environment in which demand across the majority of our businesses and regions was strong while raw material, freight and labor availability was constrained. Inflation was significant and we implemented pricing and material re-engineering actions to offset higher costs. We also leveraged our global scale, working closely with our customers and suppliers to minimize disruptions and ensure preparedness through robust scenario planning. Any such continued or prolonged disruption to our supply chain could negatively impact on our sales and profitability, and any sustained interruption in our receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are affected by changes in our markets due to competitive conditions, technological developments, laws and regulations, and customer preferences. If we do not compete effectively or respond appropriately to these changes, it could reduce market demand, or we could lose market share or be forced to reduce selling prices to maintain market share, any of which could materially adversely affect our business. We are at risk that existing or new competitors, which include some of our customers, distributors, and suppliers, will expand in our key market segments or develop new technologies, enhancing their competitive position relative to ours. Competitors also may be able to offer additional products, services, lower prices or other incentives that we cannot or would not offer or that would make our products less profitable. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or new technologies. We also are at risk to changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases, which may be affected by announced price increases, changes in our customer incentive programs, or changes in the customer’s ability to achieve incentive targets. Changes in customers’ preferences for our products can also affect demand for our products and a decline in demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are affected by changes in our markets due to increasing environmental standards. If we do not respond appropriately to these changes, it could negatively impact market demand, our market share and pricing, any of which could materially adversely affect our business.A substantial amount of our label materials is sold for use in plastic packaging in the food, beverage, and home and personal care market segments. In recent years, there has been an accelerated focus on sustainability and transparency in reporting, with greater concern regarding climate change and single-use plastics, corporate commitments and increasing 8Table of Contentsstakeholder expectations regarding the reuse and recyclability of plastic packaging and recycled content, and increased regulation across multiple geographies regarding the collection, recycling and use of recycled content. We are at risk that changes in consumer preferences or laws and regulations related to the use of plastics could reduce demand for our products. We have established strategic innovation platforms focused on material circularity and waste elimination/reduction to develop products and solutions that advance the circular economy and address the need for increased recyclability of plastic packaging, in collaboration with our customers and the businesses in our supply chain. These efforts may result in additional costs and there can be no assurance that they will be successful, and a significant reduction in the use of plastic packaging could materially adversely affect demand for our products. The scientific consensus is that the emission of greenhouse gases (“GHG”) is altering the composition of our atmosphere in ways that are adversely affecting global climate. Concern regarding climate change has led and is likely to continue to lead to increasing demands by legislators and regulators, customers, consumers, investors and non-governmental organizations for companies to reduce their GHG emissions. One of our 2025 sustainability goals is to achieve at least a 3% absolute reduction in our GHG emissions year-over-year and at least a 26% absolute reduction, compared to our 2015 baseline, by 2025; we have already exceeded this overall goal. As part of our more ambitious 2030 sustainability goals, we are aiming to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 70% compared to our 2015 baseline and work with our supply chain to reduce Scope 3 GHG emissions by 30% against our 2018 baseline, in each case by 2030, with an ambition to be net zero by 2050. We could face risks to our reputation, investor confidence and market share if we are unable to continue reducing our GHG emissions. Increased raw material costs, such as fuel and electricity, and compliance-related costs could also impact customer demand for our products. The potential impact of climate change on our business is uncertain, as it will depend on the limits imposed by, and timing of, new or stricter laws and regulations, more stringent environmental standards and expectations, and evolving customer and consumer preferences, but it could increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our business. We have recently acquired companies and are likely to acquire other companies. Acquisitions come with significant risks and uncertainties, including those related to integration, technology and employees. To grow existing businesses and expand into new areas, we have made acquisitions and are likely to continue acquiring companies that increase our presence in high value product categories, increase our pace of innovation and advance our sustainability initiatives. In 2022, we acquired TexTrace and Rietveld. The aggregate purchase consideration for the acquisitions of TexTrace and Rietveld was approximately $35 million. In 2021, we acquired Vestcom for $1.47 billion, as well as ZippyYum and JDC, for an aggregate of approximately $43 million. The success of any acquisition depends, in part, on the ability of the combined company to realize the anticipated benefits from combining our businesses. Realizing these benefits depends, in part, on maintaining adequate focus on executing the business strategies of the combined company as well as the successful integration of assets, operations, functions and personnel. We continue to evaluate potential acquisition targets and ensure we have a robust pipeline of potential opportunities. Various risks, uncertainties and costs are associated with acquisitions. Effective integration of systems, controls, employees, product lines, market segments, customers, suppliers and production facilities and cost savings can be difficult to achieve and the results of integration activities can be uncertain. While we have not experienced significant issues with our acquisitions to date, if management of our combined company is unable to continue minimizing the potential disruption of the combined company’s ongoing business during the integration process, the anticipated benefits of any acquisition may not be fully realized. In addition, the inability to successfully manage the implementation of appropriate systems, policies, benefits and compliance programs for the combined company could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may not be able to retain key employees of an acquired company or successfully execute integration strategies and achieve projected performance targets for the business segment into which an acquired company is integrated. Both before and after the closing of an acquisition, our business and that of the acquired company may suffer due to uncertainty or diversion of management attention. Future acquisitions could result in increased debt, dilution, liabilities, interest expense, restructuring charges and amortization expenses related to intangible assets. There can be no assurance that acquisitions will be successful and contribute to our profitability. Further, we may not be able to identify value-accretive acquisition targets that support our strategy of expanding our position in high value product categories or execute additional acquisitions in the future. A significant consolidation of our customer base could negatively impact our business. A significant consolidation of our customer base could negatively impact our business. In recent years, some converter customers served by our Materials Group reportable segment have consolidated and integrated vertically and some of our largest customers have acquired companies with similar or complementary product lines. This broad industry consolidation has accelerated, and could continue to increase the concentration of our business with our largest customers. Further consolidation may be accompanied by pressure from customers for lower prices. While we have been generally successful at managing customer consolidations in the past, increased pricing pressures from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business. Because some of our products are sold by third parties, our business depends in part on the financial health of these parties and their customers. Some of our products are sold not only by us, but also by third-party distributors. Some of our distributors also market products that compete with our products. Changes in the financial or business conditions, including economic weakness, 9Table of Contentsmarket trends or industry consolidation, or the purchasing decisions of these third parties or their customers could materially adversely affect our business. Our reputation, sales, and earnings could be materially adversely affected if the quality of our products and services does not meet customer expectations. In addition, product liability claims or regulatory actions could materially adversely affect our business or reputation. There are occasions when we experience product quality issues resulting from defective materials, manufacturing, packaging or design. These issues are often discovered before shipping, causing delays in shipping, delays in the manufacturing process, and occasionally cancelled orders. When issues are discovered after shipment, they may result in additional shipping costs, discounts, refunds or loss of future sales. Both pre-shipping and post-shipping quality issues could have material adverse effects on our business and negatively impact our reputation. Claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of our products arise in the ordinary course of our business. In addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments and penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our business, product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation in the marketplace and the value of our brands. We also could be required to recall and possibly discontinue the sale of potentially defective or unsafe products, which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses. Although we maintain product liability insurance coverage, product liability claims are subject to a deductible or may not be covered under the terms of the policy. Changes in our business strategies may increase our costs and could affect the profitability of our businesses. As our business environment changes, we have adjusted and may need to further adjust our business strategies or restructure our operations or particular businesses. We expended approximately $8 million and $14 million for restructuring actions in 2022 and 2021, respectively, significantly less than in 2020 when we accelerated our restructuring activities. In 2020, we implemented restructuring and investment actions across our businesses designed to increase profitability, with the reduction of positions and assets at numerous locations across our company, which included actions in Materials Group and Solutions Group. The actions in Materials Group were primarily associated with the consolidations of its operations in North America and its graphics business in Europe, in part in response to COVID-19. The actions in Solutions Group primarily related to global headcount and footprint reduction, with some actions accelerated and expanded in response to COVID-19. As we continue to develop and adjust our growth strategies, we may invest in new businesses that have short-term returns that are negative or low and whose ultimate business prospects are uncertain or could prove unprofitable. We cannot provide assurance that we will achieve the intended results of any of our business strategies, which involve operational complexities, consume management attention and require substantial resources and effort. If we fail to achieve the intended results of such actions, our costs could increase, our assets could be impaired, and our returns on investments could be lower. If we are unable to develop and successfully market new products and applications, we could compromise our competitive position. The timely introduction of new products and improvements to current products helps determine our success. Many of our current products are the result of our research and development efforts, for which we expensed $136.1 million in 2022. These efforts are directed primarily toward developing new products and operating techniques and improving product performance, often in close association with our customers or end users. These efforts include patent and product development work relating to printing and coating technologies, as well as adhesive, release and ink chemistries in Materials Group. We focus on research projects related to RFID and external embellishments in Solutions Group, for which we have and license a number of patents. Additionally, our research and development efforts include sustainable innovation and design of products that increase the use of recycled content, reduce waste, extend life or enable recycling. Research and development is complex and uncertain, requiring innovation and anticipation of market trends. We could focus on products that ultimately are not accepted by customers or end users or we could suffer delays in the production or launch of new products that may not lead to the recovery of our research and development expenditures and, as a result, could compromise our competitive position. Misassessment of our infrastructure needs could have a material adverse effect on our business. We continue to invest in our long-term growth and margin expansion plans, with $298.5 million in capital expenditures, including fixed assets and information technology, in 2022. We may not be able to recoup the costs of our infrastructure investments if actual demand is not as we anticipate. In recent years, we expanded Materials Group’s manufacturing capabilities in India and a location in Indiana; moved our Solutions Group's Vietnam business into a new, expanded facility; and made additional investments in both capacity and business development globally for our Intelligent Labels RFID platform, including a new facility in Brazil. We also transferred Materials Group’s European medical capacity from Belgium to Ireland. In addition, we added capacity through our acquisitions of Textrace, Rietveld, JDC, ZippyYum and Vestcom. Infrastructure investments, which are long-term in nature, may not generate the expected return due to changes in the marketplace, failures in execution, and other factors. Significant changes from our expected need for and/or returns on our infrastructure investments could materially adversely affect our business. 10Table of ContentsOur profitability may be materially adversely affected if we generate less productivity improvement than projected. We engage in restructuring actions intended to reduce our costs and increase efficiencies across our business segments. We had incremental savings from restructuring actions, net of transition costs, of approximately $26 million in fiscal year 2022, which largely reflected carryover savings from actions implemented in prior years. We intend to continue efforts to reduce costs in all our businesses, which have in the past included, and may continue to include, facility closures and square footage reductions, headcount reductions, organizational restructuring, process standardization, and manufacturing relocation. The consolidation of Materials Group’s operations in North America and its graphics business in Europe, the global headcount and footprint reduction in Solutions Group and the temporary cost saving actions we implemented in 2020 to mitigate the impact of the downturn caused by COVID-19 are examples of these activities. The success of these efforts is not assured and targeted savings may not be realized. In addition, cost reduction actions can result in restructuring charges and could expose us to production risk, loss of sales and employee turnover.Difficulty in the collection of receivables as a result of economic conditions or other market factors could have a material adverse effect on our business. Although we have processes to administer credit granted to customers and believe our allowance for credit losses is adequate, we have increased our allowance when determined to be appropriate due to, for example, the continued impact of COVID-19 in certain countries, supply chain challenges, issues with raw material, freight and labor availability, and persistent inflation, and in the future may experience losses as a result of our inability to collect some of our accounts receivable. The financial difficulties of a customer could result in reduced business with that customer. We may also assume higher credit risk relating to receivables of a customer experiencing financial difficulty. If these developments were to occur, our inability to collect on our accounts receivable from customers could substantially reduce our cash flows and income and have a material adverse effect on our business.There is a rapidly evolving awareness and focus from stakeholders, including our investors, customers and employees, with respect to global climate change and our company’s environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices, which could affect our business. Investor and societal expectations with respect to ESG matters have been rapidly evolving and increasing. We risk damage to our reputation if we do not continue to act responsibly with respect to ESG matters in the following key areas: environmental stewardship; DEI; corporate governance; support for our communities; and corporate governance and ESG transparency. A failure to adequately meet stakeholders’ expectations could result in loss of business, diluted market valuation, an inability to attract and retain customers and talented personnel, increased negative investor sentiment toward us and/or our customers and the diversion of investment to other industries, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and access to and costs of capital.COVID-19 had an adverse effect on portions of our business and we could experience further negative consequences as a result of COVID-19 that could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our operations largely recovered from the impact of COVID-19 beginning in 2021, with higher volume across our businesses. Uncertainty surrounding the global health crisis remained elevated in certain countries during 2022 as parts of the world experienced increased number of COVID-19 cases at some point during the year. The greatest impact to our company was in China due to lockdowns imposed by the government. We are unable to predict the full impact that COVID-19 will have on our business in 2023 due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, the impact of the spread of new and existing variants of the virus, the availability, adoption and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, and containment measures and the related macroeconomic impacts. We continue to manage this dynamic environment, including updating our scenario planning to reflect the evolving aspects of the pandemic. Risks Related to Income Taxes Changes in our tax rates could affect our business. Our effective tax rate in any period could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation. The impact of these changes could materially impact our business.The enactment of legislation implementing changes in taxation of business activities, adoption of other corporate tax reform policies, or other changes in tax legislation or policies could materially adversely impact our business. Corporate tax reform, prevention of base-erosion and tax transparency continue to be high priorities for many tax jurisdictions worldwide, including the U.S. As a result, policies regarding corporate income and other taxes are under heightened scrutiny globally, while tax reform legislation has been proposed or enacted in a number of jurisdictions. In addition, many countries have enacted, or plan to enact, legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”) recommendations and action plans, which aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, with changes to cross-border tax, transfer-pricing documentation rules, and nexus-based tax incentive practices. Moreover, the 11Table of ContentsOECD continues to engage in discussions on fundamental changes to the profit allocation among tax jurisdictions in which companies do business and the implementation of a global minimum tax. In the U.S., certain changes to the taxation of income derived from international business activities have been proposed as a reaction to the adoption of the BEPS framework, named Pillar Two, in domestic laws. Due to the size of our international business activities, any substantial change in corporate tax policies, enforcement activities or legislative or regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our inability to retain or renew certain tax incentives in foreign jurisdictions could materially adversely affect our effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate reflects benefits from concessionary tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions based on the geographic location of our manufacturing activities, the industries that we serve, or the business model under which we operate. If we do not meet the criteria required to retain or renew these tax incentives, our effective tax rate could materially increase. The amount of various taxes we pay is subject to ongoing compliance requirements and audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are subject to regular examinations of our income tax returns by various tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of material adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. In addition, tax enforcement has become increasingly aggressive in recent years focused primarily on transfer pricing and intercompany documentation. Our estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues requires significant judgment and is subject to our assessment of relevant risks, facts, and circumstances existing at the time. We use these assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and other tax-related accounts. Our results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved, which may materially adversely impact our effective tax rate. We have deferred tax assets that we may not be able to realize under certain circumstances. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in certain jurisdictions, or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. In addition, changes in statutory tax rates may change our deferred tax asset or liability balances, with either a favorable or unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate. A significant portion of our indefinite-lived net operating loss carryforwards is concentrated in Luxembourg and may require decades to be fully utilized under our current business model. Decreases in the statutory tax rate or changes in our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in Luxembourg could materially adversely affect our effective tax rate. The computation and assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets may also be materially impacted by new legislation or regulations. Risks Related to Information Technology Significant disruption to the information technology infrastructure that stores our information could materially adversely affect our business. We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a large and complex information technology infrastructure to link our global business. Like other information technology systems, ours is susceptible to a number of risks including, but not limited to, damage or interruptions resulting from obsolescence, natural disasters, power failures, human error, viruses, social engineering, phishing, ransomware or other malicious attacks and data security breaches. We upgrade and install new systems, which, if installed or programmed incorrectly or on a delayed timeframe, could cause delays or cancellations of customer orders, impede the manufacture or shipment of products, or disrupt the processing of transactions. We have continued to implement measures to mitigate our risk related to system and network disruptions, but if a disruption were to occur, we could incur significant losses and remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, we rely on services provided by third-party vendors for certain information technology processes, including system infrastructure management, application management, and software as a service. While we continued to mature our cybersecurity due diligence process, this reliance on third parties makes our operations vulnerable to a failure by any one of these vendors to perform adequately or maintain effective internal controls. Security breaches could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which could cause our business and reputation to suffer. We maintain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form, which is stored in data centers and on our networks and third-party cloud services, including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations. Data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering and theft. We develop and maintain systems to prevent this from occurring, but the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly sophisticated. Moreover, despite our efforts, the possibility of intrusion, tampering and theft cannot be eliminated entirely and the threat landscape remains challenging with digital business transformation, hybrid workforces and interconnected supply chains expanding the risk of attack. Our information technology and infrastructure may become vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due 12Table of Contentsto employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Additionally, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business objectives. While we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and, where appropriate, assess the protections utilized by these third parties, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised. We perform cybersecurity due diligence and mitigate identified risks during our M&A diligence process. While we believe we have substantially mitigated the risks related to acquired companies, there is still a risk that one of our recent acquisitions or a future acquisition may experience an incident that could lead to a breach before risks are able to be mitigated. Any such breach or attack could compromise our network, the network of a third party to whom we have disclosed confidential, proprietary or personal information, a data center where we have stored such information or a third-party cloud service provider, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any access, disclosure or loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, impair our ability to conduct business, or result in the loss or diminished value of profitable opportunities and the loss of revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property. Contractual provisions with third parties, including cloud service providers, may limit our ability to fully recover these losses. If personal information of our customers or employees were to be misappropriated, we could incur costs to compensate our customers or employees or pay damages or fines as a result of litigation or regulatory actions and our reputation with our customers and employees could be injured, resulting in loss of business or decline in morale. Data privacy legislation and regulation have been increasing in recent years – including, for example, the General Data Protection Regulation in the EU, the Cyber Security Law in China, the General Data Protection Law in Brazil and the state of California’s Privacy Rights Act – and although we have made reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to regulatory action in the event of an incident. Although we have experienced some security incidents that did not have a significant or material adverse effect on our business, this may not be the case in the future. We continue to take steps to further improve the security of our networks and computer systems, including strengthening authentication, continuing to mature our zero trust architecture and strategy, accessing our backups for ransomware resiliency and continuing to implement advanced malware detection measures; enhancing our security incident response program with escalation protocols and playbooks for security events based on risk profile; conducting third party penetration testing to assess the effectiveness of our cybersecurity; conducting employee security awareness training and phishing exercises to protect against social engineering and inadvertent or intentional disclosure of data; upgrading legacy information technology systems to simplify and standardize business processes and applications; continuously improving information technology project and portfolio management discipline; setting more aggressive key performance indicator targets and implementing appropriate mitigation measures; continuing to mature our data loss prevention framework that identifies and protects our critical data, network and site access controls; removing USB drive access across our company; increasing network segmentation; enhancing our focus on third party risk management; and improving our capabilities based on threat intelligence and the publicized incidents experienced by other companies, as well as ones that we have experienced despite their minimal operational or financial impact to date. We regularly review the effectiveness of our cybersecurity preparedness program using an industry standard cybersecurity framework and best practices (e.g., ISO27000, NIST 800). Despite these and other mitigation efforts, cyber risk and ransomware attacks on companies continue to significantly increase and there can be no assurance that we have fully protected our information, that third parties to whom we have disclosed such information or with whom we have stored such information (in data centers and on the cloud) are taking similar precautions, or that we will not experience future hacking or intrusion attempts that could have a material adverse effect on our business.Risks Related to Human Capital For us to remain competitive, it is important to recruit and retain our key management and highly-skilled employees. We also utilize various outsourcing arrangements for certain services, and related delays, resource availability, or errors by these service providers may lead to increased costs or disruption in our business. Competition to recruit and retain key management and highly-skilled employees has increased in recent years. In particular, due to our expansion to additional geographies and ongoing productivity efforts and recent employee restructuring actions, it may be difficult for us to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of highly-skilled employees. We may also be unable to recruit and retain key management and highly-skilled employees if we do not offer market-competitive employment and compensation terms. If we fail to recruit or retain our key management or sufficient numbers of highly-skilled employees, we could experience disruption in our businesses and difficulties managing our operations and implementing our business strategy. Further, if we are unable to timely and effectively advance our DEI strategy, it could impact our ability to recruit and retain talent, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business. Executive succession planning is also important to our long-term success. We experienced several recent key management changes, including recent promotions of long-serving and experienced leaders to the positions of President and Chief Operating Officer, Apparel Solutions Vice President/General Manager and Materials Group Worldwide President. While we believe we have appropriate leadership development programs and succession plans in place, any failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving our key management or other highly-skilled employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. 13Table of ContentsIn addition, we have outsourced certain services to third-party service providers, and may outsource other services in the future to achieve cost savings and operating efficiencies. Service provider delays, resource availability, business issues or errors may disrupt our businesses and/or increase costs. If we do not effectively develop, implement and manage outsourcing relationships, if third-party providers do not perform effectively or in a timely manner, or if we experience problems with transitioning work to a third party, we may not be able to achieve our expected cost savings, and may experience delays or incur additional costs to correct errors made by these service providers. We have various non-U.S. collective labor arrangements, which make us subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our business. Work interruptions or stoppages could significantly impact the volume of products we have available for sale. In addition, collective bargaining agreements, union contracts and labor laws may impair our ability to reduce labor costs by closing or downsizing manufacturing facilities because of limitations on personnel and salary changes and similar restrictions. A work stoppage at one or more of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, if any of our customers were to experience a work stoppage, that customer may halt or limit purchases of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Similarly, if any of our suppliers were to experience a work stoppage, they could halt or limit supplies of products necessary for us to conduct our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Risks Related to Our Indebtedness If our indebtedness increases significantly or our credit ratings are downgraded, we may have difficulty obtaining acceptable short- and long-term financing. At December 31, 2022, we had approximately $3.10 billion of debt. Our overall level of indebtedness and credit ratings are significant factors in our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing. Higher debt levels could negatively impact our ability to meet other business needs and could result in higher financing costs. The credit ratings assigned to us also impact the interest rates we pay. A downgrade of our short-term credit ratings could impact our ability to access the commercial paper markets and increase our borrowing costs. If our access to commercial paper markets were to become limited, as they were in March 2020 as a result of COVID-19, and we were required to obtain short-term funding under our revolving credit facility or our other credit facilities, we would face increased exposure to variable interest rates. An increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business. In 2022, our average variable-rate borrowings were approximately $487 million. Increases in short-term interest rates directly impact the amount of interest we pay. Fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs and have a material adverse effect on our business. In response to the last global economic recession, extraordinary monetary policy actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banking institutions, including the utilization of quantitative easing, were taken in recent years to maintain a low interest rate environment. Given substantially increasing inflation across the globe the Federal Reserve and similar monetary policymaking entities around the world began increasing interest rates in 2022. As of December 31, 2022 the U.S. Federal Reserve’s benchmark interest rate was between 4.25% and 4.50%, up from between 0% and 0.25% the same time in 2021.  If long-term interest rates rise, our borrowing costs will increase. Continued increases in interest rates could, among other things, reduce the availability and/or increase the costs of obtaining new debt and refinancing existing indebtedness and negatively impact our stock price. Our current and future debt covenants may limit our flexibility. Our credit facilities and the indentures governing our medium- and long-term notes contain, and any of our future indebtedness likely would contain, restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us. Among other things, these covenants restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, incur certain liens on our assets, make certain investments, sell our assets or merge with third parties, and enter into certain transactions. We are also required to maintain specified financial ratios under certain conditions. These restrictive covenants and ratios in our existing debt agreements and any future financing agreements may limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain activities and transactions that may be in our long-term best interest and could place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors, which could materially adversely affect our business. Risk Related to Ownership of Our Stock Our stock price may be subject to significant variability. Changes in our stock price may, among other things, affect our access to, or cost of financing from, capital markets and may affect our stock-based compensation arrangements and our effective tax rate. Our stock price, which increased significantly in 2020 and 2021 but declined in 2022, is influenced by changes in the overall stock market and demand for equity securities in general. Other factors, including our financial performance on an absolute basis and relative to our peers and competitors, as well as market expectations of our performance, the level of perceived growth of our industries, and 14Table of Contentsother company-specific factors, can also materially adversely affect our stock price. There can be no assurance that our stock price will not experience significant variability in the future. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to repurchase shares of our common stock or pay dividends on our common stock or that repurchases will enhance long-term stockholder value. Changes in our levels of stock repurchases or dividends could affect our stock price and significantly increase its variability. In April 2022, our Board authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock with a fair market value of up to $750 million, in addition to the amount of shares that were available for repurchase under our previous authorization. As of December 31, 2022, shares of our common stock in the aggregate amount of $730.0 million remained authorized for repurchase under the 2022 Board authorization. In 2022, we repurchased 2.2 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $379.5 million. We make share repurchases through a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades or accelerated share repurchase transactions. Our share repurchase authorizations do not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares or to repurchase any specific number of shares for any fixed period. The timing and amount of repurchases, if any, are subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. We may limit, suspend or discontinue repurchasing shares at any time at our discretion and without prior notice. Although we increased our quarterly dividend rate by approximately 10% in April 2022, there can be no assurance that we will maintain this rate or approve further increases in the future. Future dividends are subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. We are not obligated to continue a dividend for any fixed period, and the payment of dividends could be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and without prior notice. We will continue to retain future earnings to develop our business, as opportunities arise, and evaluate the amount and timing of future dividends based on our operating results, financial condition, capital requirements and general business conditions. The amount and timing of any future dividends may vary, and the payment of any dividend does not assure that we will pay dividends in the future. In addition, any future repurchases of our common stock or payment of dividends, or any determination to cease repurchasing stock or paying dividends, could affect our stock price and significantly increase its variability. Our share repurchases and any future dividends could cause our stock price to be higher than it would otherwise be and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Additionally, any future repurchases of our common stock or payment of dividends could impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions. Although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance that it will do so because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness. Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters Infringing intellectual property rights of third parties or inadequately acquiring or protecting our intellectual property could harm our ability to compete or grow. Because our products involve complex technology and chemistry, we are involved from time to time in litigation involving patents and other intellectual property. Parties have filed, and in the future may file, claims against us alleging that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We are currently party to a litigation in which ADASA Inc. (“Adasa”), an unrelated third party, alleged that certain of our RFID products infringed on its patent. We have accrued a contingent liability in the amount of $26.6 million   based on our assessment of the probabilities and associated outcomes related to this matter. For more information on this litigation, see Note 8, “Contingencies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. If we are ultimately held liable in the Adasa matter or are held liable for infringement in other matters, we could be required to pay damages, obtain licenses or cease making or selling certain products. There can be no assurance that licenses would be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The defense of these claims, whether or not meritorious, or the development of new technologies could cause us to incur significant costs and divert the attention of management. We also have valuable intellectual property upon which third parties may infringe. We attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual property and proprietary information by relying on the patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws of the U.S. and other countries, as well as non-disclosure agreements. However, it may be possible for a third party to obtain our information without our authorization, independently develop similar technologies, or breach a non-disclosure agreement entered into with us. In addition, many of the countries in which we operate do not have intellectual property laws as fulsome as those in the U.S. The use of our intellectual property by someone else without our authorization could reduce or eliminate certain competitive advantages we have, cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business. Further, the costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights could materially adversely impact our business. We have obtained and applied for U.S. and foreign trademark registrations and patents, and will continue to evaluate whether to register additional trademarks and apply for additional patents. We cannot guarantee that any of the pending applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities. Further, we cannot assure that the validity of our patents or our trademarks will not be challenged. In addition, third parties may be able to develop competing products using technology that avoids our patents. 15Table of ContentsUnfavorable developments in legal proceedings, investigations and other legal, environmental, compliance and regulatory matters, could impact us in a materially adverse manner. There can be no assurance that any outcome of any litigation, investigation or other legal, environmental, compliance and regulatory matter will be favorable. Our financial results could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome to pending or future litigation and investigations, and other legal, regulatory, environmental and compliance matters. See Note 8, “Contingencies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. We are required to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various international jurisdictions, and our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are required to comply with the anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various international jurisdictions, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK’s Bribery Act of 2010. If we fail to comply with anti-corruption laws, we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties, including fines, monetary damages and incarceration for responsible employees and managers. In addition, if our distributors or agents fail to comply with these laws, our business may also be materially adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties. We are required to comply with environmental, health, and safety laws at our operations around the world. The costs of complying with these laws could materially adversely affect our business. We are subject to national, state, provincial and/or local environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate, including those related to the disposal of hazardous waste and GHG emissions from our manufacturing processes. These laws impose liability for the costs of, and damages resulting from, cleaning up current sites, past spills, disposals and other releases of hazardous substances. These laws are often unclear and subject to the discretion of the enforcing authorities. Any failure to comply with existing and future environmental, health and safety laws could subject us to fees, penalties, costs or liabilities, impact our production capabilities, limit our ability to sell, expand or acquire facilities, and have a material adverse effect on our business. Laws and regulations related to the environment, product content and product safety are complex, change often, and can be open to different interpretations. In addition, we could be materially and adversely impacted by any environmental or product safety enforcement action affecting our suppliers, particularly in emerging markets. We have accrued liabilities for the environmental clean-up of certain sites, including the eleven sites for which U.S. governmental agencies have designated us as a potentially responsible party as of our 2022 fiscal year-end, where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. See Note 8, “Contingencies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. However, because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities, the actual expense to remediate currently identified sites and other sites that could be identified for cleanup in the future could be higher than the liabilities accrued. We are subject to export and import control laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in these markets. Export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of some of our products to embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons. While we train our employees to comply with these regulations, use third party screening software, and take other measures, we cannot guarantee that a violation will not occur. A prohibited shipment could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties, fines, civil and criminal sanctions and reputational harm. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could decrease our ability to export or sell our products internationally. Any limitation on our ability to export or sell our products could materially adversely affect our business. Some of our products are subject to export control laws and regulations and may be exported only with an export license or through an applicable export license exception. If we fail to comply with export licensing, customs regulations, economic sanctions or other laws, we could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including economic sanctions against us, incarceration for responsible employees and managers, and the possible loss of export or import privileges. In addition, if our distributors fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be materially adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties. Obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be time consuming and expensive and could result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Risks Related to Other Financial Matters Our pension assets are significant and subject to market, interest and credit risk that may reduce their value. Changes in the value of our pension assets, which was approximately $585 million as of December 31, 2022, could materially adversely affect our earnings and cash flows. In particular, the value of our investments may decline due to increases in interest rates or volatility in the financial markets. In addition, we may take actions to reduce the financial volatility associated with our pension liabilities, which could result in charges in the nearer term. As such, we continuously evaluate options to better manage the volatility associated with our pension liabilities. Although we mitigate these risks by 16Table of Contentsinvesting in high quality securities, ensuring adequate diversification of our investment portfolio and monitoring our portfolio’s overall risk profile, the value of our investments may nevertheless decline. The actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods. Changes in accounting standards and government regulations could also affect our pension and postretirement plan expense and funding requirements. We evaluate the assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our international pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans in consultation with outside actuaries. In the event that we were to determine that changes were warranted in the assumptions used, such as the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, or mortality rates, our pension and projected postretirement benefit expenses and funding requirements could increase or decrease. Because of changing market conditions or changes in the participant population, the actuarial assumptions that we use may differ from actual results, which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and related costs. Funding obligations for each plan are determined based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date as required under applicable government regulations. Our pension funding requirements, and the timing of funding payments, could also be affected by future legislation or regulation. An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our results of operations and net worth. Goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators are present). As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of our goodwill was $1.9 billion. In 2022, we determined that the goodwill of our reporting units was not impaired. We review goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. In assessing fair value, we make estimates and assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates, and discount rates based on our business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying these factors. Goodwill valuations have been calculated primarily using an income approach based on the present value of projected future cash flows of each reporting unit. We could be required to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to our business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines. These types of events could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future. Impairment charges could substantially affect our business in the periods in which they are made"
6,AVY,AVERY DENNISON CORP,2022-02-23,">Item 1A. RISK FACTORS    The risk factors described in this section could materially adversely affect our business, including our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and cause the value of our securities to decline. This list of risks is not exhaustive. Our ability to attain our goals and objectives is dependent on numerous factors and risks, including, but not limited to, the most significant ones described in this section.  Risks Related to COVID-19  COVID-19 had an adverse effect on portions of our business and we could experience further negative consequences as a result of COVID-19 that could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Our operations largely recovered in 2021 from the prior-year impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with higher volume across our businesses. Uncertainty surrounding the global health crisis remained elevated in 2021 as many parts of the world experienced an increased number of COVID-19 cases at some point during the year. The greatest impact to our company was in Southeast Asia, particularly in our RBIS reportable segment.  We worked to actively manage through a dynamic supply and demand environment in which demand across the majority of our businesses and regions was strong while raw material, freight and labor availability was constrained. Inflation was persistent and we implemented pricing and material re-engineering actions to offset higher costs. We also leveraged our global scale, working closely with our customers and suppliers to minimize disruptions and demonstrating agility and preparedness through robust scenario planning.  We are unable to predict the full impact that COVID-19 will have on our business in 2022 due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, the impact of the spread of new and existing variants of the virus, the availability, adoption and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, and containment measures and the related macroeconomic impacts. We continue to manage this dynamic environment and regularly update our scenario planning to reflect the continuously evolving aspects of the pandemic.  We cannot predict the impact of COVID-19 on our customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners, including our financing sources, and how these impacts will affect our business.  COVID-19 has affected and is likely to continue affecting our customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners, but we are not able to predict the ultimate consequences that will result. Delays in production or delivery of components or raw materials in our global supply chain, or the cost and ability to transport those components or materials or our finished goods, due to restrictions imposed to limit the spread of COVID-19 have delayed and could further delay or inhibit our ability to obtain supply of components and materials to deliver finished goods to customers, with these impacts and the higher cost of freight also increasing our costs. While we have mitigated some of this impact by raising prices, continued increases in pricing to combat inflation could result in loss of customers to other suppliers, reduction of our market share and material and adverse impact to our business. While supply chain constraints and raw material availability had a significant impact on our teams and industries during fiscal year 2021, they did not have a significant adverse impact on our financial results due to our implementation of mitigation strategies. If conditions continue to worsen or last for an extended period of time, or if inflation remains persistent, our supply chains could be materially adversely affected. If our sales channels were to become substantially impacted for an extended period of time, our business could be materially adversely affected. In the first quarter of 2020, our ability to access the commercial paper market was disrupted as a result of the pandemic and we drew down $500 million from our revolving credit facility, which we repaid in the second quarter of 2020. If commercial paper markets or our ability to draw under our $800 million revolving credit facility were to become disrupted in the future due to the impact of COVID-19 on our customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners, our liquidity could be impacted which could materially adversely affect our business.  The ability of our employees to work has been and may continue to be significantly impacted by COVID-19.  Our employees have been significantly impacted by COVID-19. Our office and management personnel in certain countries have generally worked from home since March 2020, and some of our employees engaged in manufacturing, production and distribution facilities have been at times restricted by governmental orders from coming to work. We have experienced, and may experience in the future, temporary facility closures in response to government mandates in certain jurisdictions in which we operate. The safety and well-being of our employees has    6    Table of Contents   been and continues to be our top priority. We have taken steps to ensure employee safety, quickly implementing world-class safety protocols and continuing to adapt our guidelines as the pandemic continues to evolve and we may need to implement further precautionary measures to help minimize the risk of our workforce being exposed to COVID-19, including securing supplies for our facilities and providing personal protective equipment for our employees. Where appropriate, we may take further actions required by international, federal, state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, shareholders and communities. The pandemic has already constrained the labor market, with certain individuals electing to leave their current positions or the workforce entirely (commonly referred to as the “great resignation”) and both prospective and current employees more actively seeking higher compensation and benefits in what has become known as the “war for talent.” Further, our management team is focused on mitigating the economic effects of COVID-19, which required and will continue to require a large investment of time and resources across our entire company, diverting attention from other priorities. If these conditions worsen, or last for an extended period of time, or there is a disruption in the technology we use to operate remotely, our ability to manage our business may be impaired and operational, cybersecurity and other risks may be elevated.  Risk Related to Our International Operations  The demand for our products is impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic, social, political and market conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We have operations in over 50 countries and our domestic and international operations are strongly influenced by matters beyond our control, including changes in political, social, economic and labor conditions, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign earnings), and international trade regulations (including tariffs), as well as the impact of these changes on the underlying demand for our products. In 2021, approximately 75% of our net sales were from international operations.  Macroeconomic developments such as impacts from COVID-19, inflation, raw material, freight and labor availability, slower growth in the geographic regions in which we operate and uncertainty in the global credit or financial markets leading to a loss of consumer confidence could result in a material adverse effect on our business as a result of, among other things, reduced consumer spending, declines in asset valuations, diminished liquidity and credit availability, volatility in securities prices, credit rating downgrades and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  While we saw the ease of trade tensions between the U.S. and some of its trading partners such as the EU and Japan, we continue to face uncertainty from trade relations between the U.S. and China. Over the past few years, the U.S. government has imposed additional tariffs on products imported into the U.S. from China. This has resulted in reciprocal tariffs on goods imported from the U.S. into China. The impacts on our operations to date have not been significant. There remains risk that our business could be significantly impacted if additional tariffs or other restrictions are imposed on products. Any of these actions or further developments in international trade relations could have a material adverse effect on our business.  In addition, business and operational disruptions or delays caused by political, social or economic instability and unrest – such as civil, political and economic disturbances in places such as the U.S., Russia, Ukraine, Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, North Korea, and Hong Kong and the related impact on global stability, terrorist attacks and the potential for other hostilities, public health crises or natural disasters in various parts of the world – could contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are not able to predict the duration and severity of adverse economic, social, political or market conditions in the U.S. or other countries.  Foreign currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in those rates, may materially adversely affect our business.  The substantial majority of our net sales in 2021 was in foreign currencies. Fluctuations in currencies, such as those associated with the euro and Chinese yuan in 2021, which had a favorable impact for this year, can be unfavorable and result in a variety of negative effects, including lower net sales, increased costs, lower gross margin percentages, increased allowance for credit losses and/or write-offs of accounts receivable, and required recognition of impairments of capitalized assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets. Foreign currency translation increased our net sales in 2021 by approximately $201 million. Margins on sales of our products in foreign countries could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.    7      Table of Contents   We monitor our foreign currency exposures and may, from time to time, use hedging instruments to mitigate transactional exposure to changes in foreign currencies. The effectiveness of our hedges in part depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows, which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates. Further, hedging activities may offset only a portion, or none at all, of the material adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place and we may incur significant losses from hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility and foreign currency fluctuations.  Our strategy includes increased growth in emerging markets, including China, which could create greater exposure to unstable political conditions, civil unrest, economic volatility, contagious disease and other risks applicable to international operations.  A significant amount of our net sales – approximately half of our net sales in 2021 – originated in emerging markets, including countries in Asia Pacific, Latin America and Eastern Europe. The profitable growth of our business in emerging markets is a significant focus of our long-term growth strategy and our regional results have and can fluctuate significantly based on economic conditions in these regions. Our business operations have been and may be adversely affected by the current and future political environment in China, including as a result of its response to tariffs instituted by the U.S. government on goods imported from China, tariffs imposed by China on U.S. goods, more active use of economic sanctions and export control restrictions, any trade agreements entered into between the U.S. and China, and increasing tensions as a result of the two countries’ relationships with Hong Kong and Taiwan. Our ability to operate in China or other emerging markets may be adversely affected by changes in the laws and regulations of these jurisdictions or the interpretation thereof, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, raw materials, environmental regulations, land use rights, property, foreign currency conversion, the regulation of private enterprises and other matters.  In early 2020, in response to the initial outbreak of COVID-19, many of our manufacturing and other operations in China experienced limited production and/or closure; as the outbreak spread beyond this region, our facilities in other countries were similarly impacted, most significantly in South Asia in late 2020. In 2021, with the spread of the Delta variant mid-year, we experienced intermittent closures in Southeast Asia, particularly in our RBIS reportable segment. All of our manufacturing facilities are currently open, but, many of our employees are still unable to travel easily within and outside their countries. The pandemic and any other adverse development in emerging markets could have a material adverse effect on our business.  There have been and could be further disruptions in our supply chain or ability to manufacture our products, as well as temporary closures of our facilities or those of our suppliers or customers, any of which could impact our sales and operating results. Overall, COVID-19 had a negative impact on our consolidated financial results in 2020, most significantly in our RBIS and IHM reportable segments; its direct impact on our operations in 2021 was more modest. The extent to which the pandemic will continue to impact our financial results is dependent on future developments, which are uncertain and unpredictable. COVID-19 has adversely affected the economies and financial markets in virtually all countries, and further escalation of the pandemic could lead to a more significant economic downturn that could adversely affect demand for our products and negatively impact our business.  If we are unable to successfully expand our business in emerging markets or achieve the return on capital we expect as a result of our investments in these countries, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected. In addition to the risks applicable to our international operations, factors that could have a material adverse effect on our operations in these emerging markets include the less established or reliable legal systems and possible disruptions due to unstable political conditions, civil unrest or economic volatility. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business by decreasing consumer purchasing power, reducing demand for our products or increasing our costs.  Our operations and activities outside of the U.S. may subject us to risks different from and potentially greater than those associated with our domestic operations.  A substantial portion of our employees and assets are located outside of the U.S. and, in 2021, approximately 75% of our sales was generated outside of the U.S. International operations and activities involve risks that are different from and potentially greater than the risks we face with respect to our domestic operations; changes in foreign political, regulatory and economic conditions, including nationally, regionally and locally; material adverse effects of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies; inflation; reduced protection of intellectual property    8      Table of Contents   rights; laws and regulations impacting the ability to repatriate foreign earnings; challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to sales, operations, taxes, employment and legal proceedings; establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate our international operations and monitor compliance with U.S. laws and regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign laws and regulations, such as the UK’s Bribery Act of 2010; differences in lending practices; challenges with complying with applicable export and import control laws and regulations; and differences in language, culture and time zone.  Uncertainty remains as to how the exit of the United Kingdom (“UK”) from the European Union (“EU”) (commonly known as “Brexit”) will affect the legal and regulatory environment in the European Union and the UK, as well as whether other countries in the European Union may approve similar measures and cause further uncertainty in the region. The post-Brexit UK-EU relationship is under strain, with differences in terms of Northern Ireland and the border and immigration arrangements between the two. A prolonged, acrimonious process, compounded by the pandemic and its economic fallout, could weaken the continent as a whole as other powers, notably China and Russia, become increasingly assertive. While our operations in the UK are relatively small, we have operations in many countries in the European Union; as a result, the realization of any of these risks or the failure to comply with any laws or regulations in the European Union or the UK could expose us to liabilities and have a material adverse effect on our business.  Risks Related to Our Business  As a manufacturer, our sales and profitability depend upon the cost and availability of raw materials and energy, which are subject to price fluctuations, and our ability to control or offset increases in raw material and labor costs. Raw material and freight cost increases have impacted our business and could materially adversely affect our business.  The availability of raw materials used in our businesses became constrained in 2021, which could continue to present challenges and lead to volatility, impacting availability and pricing. Additionally, energy costs increased in 2021 and can also be volatile and unpredictable. Shortages and inflationary or other increases in the costs of raw materials, labor, freight and energy were significant in 2021. During the year, we implemented targeted price increases across our businesses and regions to address raw material and freight inflation. If inflation remains persistent in 2022, we may have to implement similar pricing measures. Our performance depends in part on our ability to offset cost increases for raw materials by raising our sales prices or re-engineering our products.  It is important for us to obtain timely delivery of materials, equipment, and other resources from suppliers, and to make timely delivery to customers. In 2021, we experienced supply chain interruptions due to natural and other disasters, which are becoming more frequent due to the impacts from climate change, or other events, such as COVID-19. Any such continued or prolonged disruption to our supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability, and any sustained interruption in our receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We are affected by changes in our markets due to competitive conditions, technological developments, laws and regulations, and customer preferences. If we do not compete effectively or respond appropriately to these changes, it could reduce market demand, or we could lose market share or be forced to reduce selling prices to maintain market share, any of which could materially adversely affect our business.  We are at risk that existing or new competitors, which include some of our customers, distributors, and suppliers, will expand in our key market segments or develop new technologies, enhancing their competitive position relative to ours. Competitors also may be able to offer additional products, services, lower prices or other incentives that we cannot or would not offer or that would make our products less profitable. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or new technologies.  We also are at risk to changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases, which may be affected by announced price increases, changes in our customer incentive programs, or changes in the customer’s ability to achieve incentive targets. Changes in customers’ preferences for our products can also affect demand for our products and a decline in demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We are affected by changes in our markets due to environmental standards. If we do not respond appropriately to these changes, it could negatively impact market demand, market share and pricing, any of which could materially adversely affect our business.    9      Table of Contents   A substantial amount of our label materials are sold for use in plastic packaging in the food, beverage, and home and personal care market segments. In recent years, there has been an accelerated focus on sustainability and transparency in reporting, with greater concern regarding climate change and single-use plastics, corporate commitments and increasing stakeholder expectations regarding the reuse and recyclability of plastic packaging and recycled content, and increased regulation across multiple geographies regarding the collection, recycling and use of recycled content. We are at risk that changes in consumer preferences or laws and regulations related to the use of plastics could reduce demand for our products. We have established strategic innovation platforms focused on material circularity and waste elimination/reduction to develop products and solutions that advance the circular economy and address the need for increased recyclability of plastic packaging, in collaboration with our customers and the businesses in our supply chain. These efforts may result in additional costs and there can be no assurance that they will be successful, and a significant reduction in the use of plastic packaging could materially adversely affect demand for our products.  The scientific consensus is that the emission of greenhouse gases (“GHG”) is altering the composition of our atmosphere in ways that are adversely affecting global climate. Concern regarding climate change has led and is likely to continue to lead to increasing demands by legislators and regulators, customers, consumers, investors and non-governmental organizations for companies to reduce their GHG emissions. In 2015, we set a goal to achieve at least a 3% absolute reduction in our GHG emissions year-over-year and at least a 26% absolute reduction, compared to our 2015 baseline, by 2025; we have already exceeded this overall goal. As part of our more ambitious 2030 sustainability goals announced in the first quarter of 2021, we are aiming to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 70% compared to our 2015 baseline and work with our supply chain to reduce Scope 3 GHG emissions by 30% against our 2018 baseline, in each case by 2030, with an ambition to be net zero by 2050. We could face risks to our reputation, investor confidence and market share if we are unable to continue reducing our GHG emissions. Increased raw material costs, such as fuel and electricity, and compliance-related costs could also impact customer demand for our products. The potential impact of climate change on our business is uncertain, as it will depend on the limits imposed by, and timing of, new or stricter laws and regulations, more stringent environmental standards and expectations, and evolving customer and consumer preferences, but it could increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our business.  We have recently acquired companies and are likely to acquire other companies. Acquisitions come with significant risks and uncertainties, including those related to integration, technology and employees.  To grow existing businesses and expand into new areas, we have made acquisitions and are likely to continue doing so. In 2021, we acquired Vestcom, an Arkansas-based provider of shelf-edge pricing, productivity and consumer engagement solutions for retailers and consumer packaged goods companies, for $1.47 billion, as well as ZippyYum, a California-based developer of software products used in the food service and food preparation industries, and JDC, a Tennessee-based manufacturer of pressure-sensitive specialty tapes, for an aggregate of approximately $43 million. In 2020, we completed our acquisitions of Smartrac’s Transponder (RFID Inlay) Division, a manufacturer of RFID products, for approximately $255 million; ACPO, Ltd. (“ACPO”), an Ohio-based manufacturer of self-wound (linerless) pressure-sensitive overlaminate products, for approximately $88 million. The success of any acquisition depends, in part, on the ability of the combined company to realize the anticipated benefits from combining our businesses. Realizing these benefits depends, in part, on maintaining adequate focus on executing the business strategies of the combined company as well as the successful integration of assets, operations, functions and personnel. We continue to evaluate potential acquisition targets and ensure we have a robust pipeline of potential opportunities.  Various risks, uncertainties and costs are associated with acquisitions. Effective integration of systems, controls, employees, product lines, market segments, customers, suppliers and production facilities and cost savings can be difficult to achieve and the results of integration activities can be uncertain. While we have not experienced issues with our acquisitions to date, including our recent acquisition of Vestcom, if management of our combined company is unable to continue minimizing the potential disruption of the combined company’s ongoing business during the integration process, the anticipated benefits of any acquisition may not be fully realized. In addition, the inability to successfully manage the implementation of appropriate systems, policies, benefits and compliance programs for the combined company could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may not be able to retain key employees of an acquired company or successfully execute integration strategies and achieve projected performance targets for the business segment into which an acquired company is integrated. Both before and after the closing of an acquisition, our business and that of the acquired company may suffer due to uncertainty or diversion of management attention. Future acquisitions could result in increased debt, dilution, liabilities, interest expense, restructuring charges and amortization expenses related to intangible assets. There can be no assurance that    10      Table of Contents   acquisitions will be successful and contribute to our profitability. Further, we may not be able to identify value-accretive acquisition targets that support our strategy of expanding our position in high value product categories or execute additional acquisitions in the future.  A significant consolidation of our customer base could negatively impact our business.  A significant consolidation of our customer base could negatively impact our business. Some converter customers served by our LGM reportable segment have consolidated and integrated vertically and some of our largest customers have acquired companies with similar or complementary product lines. This broad industry consolidation has accelerated, and could continue to increase the concentration of our business with our largest customers. Further consolidation may be accompanied by pressure from customers for lower prices. While we have been generally successful at managing customer consolidations in the past, increased pricing pressures from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Because some of our products are sold by third parties, our business depends in part on the financial health of these parties and their customers.  Some of our products are sold not only by us, but also by third-party distributors. Some of our distributors also market products that compete with our products. Changes in the financial or business conditions, including economic weakness, market trends or industry consolidation, or the purchasing decisions of these third parties or their customers could materially adversely affect our business.  Our reputation, sales, and earnings could be materially adversely affected if the quality of our products and services does not meet customer expectations. In addition, product liability claims or regulatory actions could materially adversely affect our business or reputation.  There are occasions when we experience product quality issues resulting from defective materials, manufacturing, packaging or design. These issues are often discovered before shipping, causing delays in shipping, delays in the manufacturing process, and occasionally cancelled orders. When issues are discovered after shipment, they may result in additional shipping costs, discounts, refunds or loss of future sales. Both pre-shipping and post-shipping quality issues could have material adverse effects on our business and negatively impact our reputation.  Claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of our products arise in the ordinary course of our business. In addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments and penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our business, product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation in the marketplace and the value of our brands. We also could be required to recall and possibly discontinue the sale of potentially defective or unsafe products, which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses. Although we maintain product liability insurance coverage, product liability claims are subject to a deductible or may not be covered under the terms of the policy.  Changes in our business strategies may increase our costs and could affect the profitability of our businesses.  As our business environment changes, we have adjusted and may need to further adjust our business strategies or restructure our operations or particular businesses. In 2021, we expended approximately $14 million for restructuring actions, significantly lower than in 2020 when we accelerated our restructuring activities. In 2020, we implemented restructuring and investment actions across our businesses designed to increase profitability, with the reduction of positions and assets at numerous locations across our company, which primarily included actions in LGM and RBIS. The actions in LGM were primarily associated with the consolidations of operations in North America and its graphics business in Europe, in part in response to COVID-19. The actions in RBIS primarily related to global headcount and footprint reduction, with some actions accelerated and expanded in response to COVID-19. In 2020, we also reduced costs across our company in response to COVID-19, approximately $135 million of which were temporary and largely returned in 2021 as markets recovered. As we continue to develop and adjust our growth strategies, we may invest in new businesses that have short-term returns that are negative or low and whose ultimate business prospects are uncertain or could prove unprofitable. We cannot provide assurance that we will achieve the intended results of any of our business strategies, which involve operational complexities, consume management attention and require substantial resources and effort. If we fail to achieve the intended results of such actions, our costs could increase, our assets could be impaired, and our returns on investments could be lower.    11      Table of Contents   If we are unable to develop and successfully market new products and applications, we could compromise our competitive position.  The timely introduction of new products and improvements to current products helps determine our success. Many of our current products are the result of our research and development efforts, for which we expensed $137 million in 2021. These efforts are directed primarily toward developing new products and operating techniques and improving product performance, often in close association with our customers or end users. These efforts include patent and product development work relating to printing and coating technologies, as well as adhesive, release and ink chemistries in LGM and IHM. We focus on research projects related to RFID and external embellishments in RBIS and medical technologies in IHM, for which we have and license a number of patents. Additionally, our research and development efforts include sustainable innovation and design of products that increase the use of recycled content, reduce waste, extend life or enable recycling.    Research and development is complex and uncertain, requiring innovation and anticipation of market trends. We could focus on products that ultimately are not accepted by customers or end users or we could suffer delays in the production or launch of new products that may not lead to the recovery of our research and development expenditures and, as a result, could compromise our competitive position.  Misassessment of our infrastructure needs could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We recently increased our pace of capital investment to support our long-term growth and margin expansion plans, with $272.1 million in capital expenditures, including fixed assets and information technology, in 2021. We may not be able to recoup the costs of our infrastructure investments if actual demand is not as we anticipate. In recent years, we expanded LGM’s manufacturing facilities located in emerging markets and a location in Indiana; moved our RBIS Vietnam business into a new, expanded facility; closed an LGM facility in Germany and consolidated those operations with operations in Luxembourg and Belgium; and made additional investments in capacity to support growth in our U.S. graphics business, our label and packaging materials businesses in Luxembourg and Ohio, and in both capacity and business development globally for our Intelligent Labels RFID platform. We also transferred IHM’s European medical capacity from Belgium to Ireland. In addition, we added capacity through our acquisitions of Smartrac, ACPO, JDC, ZippyYum and Vestcom. Infrastructure investments, which are long-term in nature, may not generate the expected return due to changes in the marketplace, failures in execution, and other factors. Significant changes from our expected need for and/or returns on our infrastructure investments could materially adversely affect our business.  Our profitability may be materially adversely affected if we generate less productivity improvement than projected.  We engage in restructuring actions intended to reduce our costs and increase efficiencies across our business segments. We intend to continue efforts to reduce costs in all our businesses, which have in the past included, and may continue to include, facility closures and square footage reductions, headcount reductions, organizational restructuring, process standardization, and manufacturing relocation. The consolidation LGM’s operations in North America and its graphics business in Europe, the global headcount and footprint reduction in RBIS and the temporary cost saving actions we implemented in 2020 to mitigate the impact of the downturn caused by COVID-19 are examples of these activities. We had incremental savings from restructuring actions, net of transition costs, of approximately $65 million in fiscal year 2021. The success of these efforts is not assured and targeted savings may not be realized. In addition, cost reduction actions can result in restructuring charges and could expose us to production risk, loss of sales and employee turnover. Difficulty in the collection of receivables as a result of economic conditions or other market factors could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Although we have processes to administer credit granted to customers and believe our allowance for credit losses is adequate, we have increased our allowance when determined to be appropriate due to, for example, the continued impact of COVID-19 and related supply chain challenges, issues with raw material, freight and labor availability, and persistent inflation, and in the future may experience losses as a result of our inability to collect some of our accounts receivable. The financial difficulties of a customer could result in reduced business with that customer. We may also assume higher credit risk relating to receivables of a customer experiencing financial difficulty. If these developments were to occur, our inability to collect on our accounts receivable from customers could substantially reduce our cash flows and income and have a material adverse effect on our business.    12      Table of Contents   Risks Related to Income Taxes  Changes in our tax rates could affect our earnings.  Our effective tax rate in any period could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation. There can be no assurance that any of these changes would not have a material adverse effect on our business.  Potential new U.S. tax legislation could materially adversely affect our effective tax rate.  The U.S. government has proposed significant changes to the taxation of corporations, which may include an increase in the corporate income tax rate, the imposition of minimum taxes or surtaxes on certain types of income, significant changes to the taxation of income derived from international business activities, and the addition of further limitations on interest deductions. While various proposals are under consideration it is unclear at this time, what, if any changes will be enacted. The impact and timing of these potential changes are uncertain and may materially adversely impact our effective tax rate.  The enactment of legislation implementing changes in taxation of international business activities, adoption of other corporate tax reform policies, or other changes in tax legislation or policies could materially adversely impact our business.  Corporate tax reform, prevention of base-erosion and tax transparency continue to be high priorities for many tax jurisdictions worldwide. As a result, policies regarding corporate income and other taxes are under heightened scrutiny globally, while tax reform legislation has been proposed or enacted in a number of jurisdictions.  In addition, many countries have enacted, or plan to enact, legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”) recommendations and action plans, which aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, with changes to cross-border tax, transfer-pricing documentation rules, and nexus-based tax incentive practices. Moreover, the OECD Inclusive Framework (“IF”) on BEPS recently released a series of statements indicating that agreement was reached by nearly all IF members on a two-pillar solution to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy and providing an aggressive timeline for implementation. As a result of heightened scrutiny of corporate taxation policies, prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to enforcement activities or legislative investigation and inquiry, which could also result in changes in tax policies or prior tax rulings. Any such changes in policies or rulings may also result in the taxes we previously paid being subject to change.  Due to the large scale of our international business activities, any substantial change in international corporate tax policies, enforcement activities or legislative initiatives could have a material adverse effect on the amount of taxes we pay and our business generally.  Our inability to retain or renew certain tax incentives in foreign jurisdictions could materially adversely affect our effective tax rate.  Our effective tax rate reflects benefits from concessionary tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions based on the geographic location of our manufacturing activities, the industries that we serve, or the business model under which we operate. If we do not meet the criteria required to retain or renew these tax incentives, our effective tax rate could materially increase.  The amount of various taxes we pay is subject to ongoing compliance requirements and audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities.  We are subject to regular examinations of our income tax returns by various tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of material adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. In addition, tax enforcement has become increasingly aggressive in recent years, including continued actions by the European Commission related to illegal state aid, with increased focus on transfer pricing and intercompany documentation. Our estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues requires significant judgment and is subject to our assessment of relevant risks, facts, and circumstances existing at the time. We use these assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and other tax-related accounts. Our    13      Table of Contents   results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved, which may materially adversely impact our effective tax rate and have a material adverse effect on our business.  We have deferred tax assets that we may not be able to realize under certain circumstances.  If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in certain jurisdictions, or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. In addition, changes in statutory tax rates may change our deferred tax asset or liability balances, with either a favorable or unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate. A significant portion of our indefinite-lived net operating loss carryforwards is concentrated in Luxembourg and may require decades to be fully utilized under our current business model. Decreases in the statutory tax rate or changes in our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in Luxembourg could materially adversely affect our effective tax rate. The computation and assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets may also be materially impacted by new legislation or regulations.  Risks Related to Information Technology  Significant disruption to the information technology infrastructure that stores our information could materially adversely affect our business.  We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a large and complex information technology infrastructure to link our global business. Like other information technology systems, ours is susceptible to a number of risks including, but not limited to, damage or interruptions resulting from obsolescence, natural disasters, power failures, human error, viruses, social engineering, phishing, ransomware or other malicious attacks and data security breaches. We upgrade and install new systems, which, if installed or programmed incorrectly or on a delayed timeframe, could cause delays or cancellations of customer orders, impede the manufacture or shipment of products, or disrupt the processing of transactions. For example, we have invested in information technology to upgrade the systems in both our LGM North America business and RBIS reportable segment to drive efficiency and supply chain productivity. Processes affected by these implementations included, among other things, order management, pricing, shipping, purchasing, supply chain and financial reporting. We have implemented measures to mitigate our risk related to system and network disruptions, but if a disruption were to occur, we could incur significant losses and remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, we rely on services provided by third-party vendors for certain information technology processes, including system infrastructure management, application management, and software as service. While we have further matured our cybersecurity due diligence process in 2021, this reliance on third parties makes our operations vulnerable to a failure by any one of these vendors to perform adequately or maintain effective internal controls.  Security breaches could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which could cause our business and reputation to suffer.  We maintain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form, which is stored in data centers and on our networks and third-party cloud services, including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations. Data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering and theft. We develop and maintain systems to prevent this from occurring, but the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly sophisticated. Moreover, despite our efforts, the possibility of intrusion, tampering and theft cannot be eliminated entirely. Our information technology and infrastructure may become vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Additionally, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business objectives. While we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and, where appropriate, assess the protections utilized by these third parties, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised.  We perform cybersecurity due diligence and mitigate identified risks during our M&A diligence process. While we have a defined process, which we believe has substantially mitigated the risks related to acquired companies,    14      Table of Contents   there is still a risk that one of our recent acquisitions or a future acquisition target may experience an incident that could lead to a breach before risks are able to be mitigated.  Any such breach or attack could compromise our network, the network of a third party to whom we have disclosed confidential, proprietary or personal information, a data center where we have stored such information or a third-party cloud service provider, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any access, disclosure or loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, impair our ability to conduct business, or result in the loss or diminished value of profitable opportunities and the loss of revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property. Contractual provisions with third parties, including cloud service providers, may limit our ability to fully recover these losses. If personal information of our customers or employees were to be misappropriated, we could incur costs to compensate our customers or employees or pay damages or fines as a result of litigation or regulatory actions and our reputation with our customers and employees could be injured, resulting in loss of business or decline in morale. Data privacy legislation and regulation have been increasing in recent years – including, for example, the General Data Protection Regulation in the EU, the Cyber Security Law in China, the General Data Protection Law in Brazil and the state of California’s Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 – and although we have made reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to regulatory action in the event of an incident.  Although we have experienced some security incidents that did not have a significant or material adverse effect on our business, this may not be the case in the future. We have taken many steps to further improve the security of our networks and computer systems, including conducting employee security awareness training and phishing exercises to protect against social engineering and inadvertent or intentional disclosure of data; implementing multi-factor authentication, adopting a zero trust architecture and strategy, accessing our backups for ransomware resiliency, and advanced malware detection measures; upgrading legacy information technology systems to simplify and standardize business processes and applications; continuously improving information technology project and portfolio management discipline, using metrics and reviews and implementing appropriate mitigation measures; establishing a data loss prevention framework to better identify and protect our critical data; conducting third party penetration testing to assess the effectiveness of our cybersecurity, network and site access controls; removing USB drive access across our company; and improving our capabilities based on threat intelligence and the publicized incidents experienced by other companies, as well as ones that we have experienced despite their minimal operational or financial impact to date. We regularly review the effectiveness of our cybersecurity preparedness program using an industry standard cybersecurity framework and best practices (e.g., ISO27000, NIST 800). Despite these and other mitigation efforts, cyber risk and ransomware attacks on companies continue to significantly increase and there can be no assurance that we have fully protected our information, that third parties to whom we have disclosed such information or with whom we have stored such information (in data centers and on the cloud) are taking similar precautions, or that we will not experience future hacking or intrusion attempts that could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Risks Related to Human Capital  For us to remain competitive, it is important to recruit and retain our key management and highly-skilled employees. We also utilize various outsourcing arrangements for certain services, and related delays, resource availability, or errors by these service providers may lead to increased costs or disruption in our business.  There is significant competition to recruit and retain key management and highly-skilled employees. In particular, due to our expansion to additional geographies and ongoing productivity efforts and recent employee restructuring actions, it may be difficult for us to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of highly-skilled employees. We may also be unable to recruit and retain key management and highly-skilled employees if we do not offer market-competitive employment and compensation terms. If we fail to recruit or retain our key management or sufficient numbers of highly-skilled employees, we could experience disruption in our businesses and difficulties managing our operations and implementing our business strategy. Further, if we are unable to timely and effectively advance our DE&I strategy, it could impact our ability to recruit and retain talent, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.  Executive succession planning is also important to our long-term success. We experienced several recent key management changes, including promotions of long-serving and experienced leaders to the positions of RBIS Apparel Solutions Vice President/General Manager and IHM Vice President/General Manager in early 2022 and    15      Table of Contents   Chief Human Resources Officer and Chief Legal Officer in 2020. While we believe we have appropriate leadership development programs and succession plans in place, any failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving our key management or other highly-skilled employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.  In addition, we have outsourced certain services to third-party service providers, and may outsource other services in the future to achieve cost savings and operating efficiencies. Service provider delays, resource availability, business issues or errors may disrupt our businesses and/or increase costs. If we do not effectively develop, implement and manage outsourcing relationships, if third-party providers do not perform effectively or in a timely manner, or if we experience problems with transitioning work to a third party, we may not be able to achieve our expected cost savings, and may experience delays or incur additional costs to correct errors made by these service providers.  We have various non-U.S. collective labor arrangements, which make us subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our business.  Work interruptions or stoppages could significantly impact the volume of products we have available for sale. In addition, collective bargaining agreements, union contracts and labor laws may impair our ability to reduce labor costs by closing or downsizing manufacturing facilities because of limitations on personnel and salary changes and similar restrictions. A work stoppage at one or more of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, if any of our customers were to experience a work stoppage, that customer may halt or limit purchases of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Similarly, if any of our suppliers were to experience a work stoppage, they could halt or limit supplies of products necessary for us to conduct our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Risks Related to Our Indebtedness  If our indebtedness increases significantly or our credit ratings are downgraded, we may have difficulty obtaining acceptable short- and long-term financing.  At January 1, 2022, we had approximately $3.10 billion of debt. Our overall level of indebtedness and credit ratings are significant factors in our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing. Higher debt levels could negatively impact our ability to meet other business needs and could result in higher financing costs. The credit ratings assigned to us also impact the interest rates we pay. A downgrade of our short-term credit ratings could impact our ability to access the commercial paper markets and increase our borrowing costs. If our access to commercial paper markets were to become limited, as they were in March 2020 as a result of COVID-19, and we were required to obtain short-term funding under our revolving credit facility or our other credit facilities, we would face increased exposure to variable interest rates.  An increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business.  In 2021, our average variable-rate borrowings were approximately $177 million. Increases in short-term interest rates would directly impact the amount of interest we pay. Fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs and have a material adverse effect on our business.  In response to the last global economic recession, extraordinary monetary policy actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banking institutions, including the utilization of quantitative easing, were taken to create and maintain a low interest rate environment. As of January 1, 2022 the U.S. Federal Reserve’s benchmark interest rate was between 0% and 0.25%. The Federal Reserve has indicated that it will begin raising interest rates as early as March 2022, with additional increases possible later in the year. If this occurs, long-term interest rates will rise and our borrowing costs will increase. Such a transition may, among other things, reduce the availability and/or increase the costs of obtaining new debt and refinancing existing indebtedness, and negatively impact our stock price.  The discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) may adversely affect our borrowing costs.  As of January 1, 2022, approximately $313 million of our outstanding indebtedness bears interest at variable interest rates, none of which is based on LIBOR; however, our revolving credit facility is based on LIBOR. In March 2021, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer require panel banks to submit quotes for    16      Table of Contents   LIBOR settings other than overnight and 12-month U.S. dollar LIBOR after December 31, 2021, and will no longer require panel banks to submit quotes for any U.S. dollar LIBOR settings after June 30, 2023. Although we do not believe the risk to be significant for us, the replacement rate for LIBOR in our revolving credit facility could cause our borrowing costs to increase.  Our current and future debt covenants may limit our flexibility.  Our credit facilities and the indentures governing our medium- and long-term notes contain, and any of our future indebtedness likely would contain, restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us. Among other things, these covenants restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, incur certain liens on our assets, make certain investments, sell our assets or merge with third parties, and enter into certain transactions. We are also required to maintain specified financial ratios under certain conditions. These restrictive covenants and ratios in our existing debt agreements and any future financing agreements may limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain activities and transactions that may be in our long-term best interests and could place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors, which could materially adversely affect our business.  Risk Related to Ownership of Our Stock  Our stock price may be subject to significant variability.  Changes in our stock price may, among other things, affect our access to, or cost of financing from, capital markets and may affect our stock-based compensation arrangements and our effective tax rate. Our stock price, which increased significantly in 2019, 2020 and 2021 but declined in early 2022, is influenced by changes in the overall stock market and demand for equity securities in general, as seen in both 2020 and 2021, due in part to the impact of COVID-19. Other factors, including our financial performance on an absolute basis and relative to our peers and competitors, as well as market expectations of our performance, the level of perceived growth of our industries, and other company-specific factors, can also materially adversely affect our stock price. There can be no assurance that our stock price will not experience significant variability in the future.  We cannot guarantee that we will continue to repurchase shares of our common stock or pay dividends on our common stock or that repurchases will enhance long-term stockholder value. Changes in our levels of stock repurchases or dividends could affect our stock price and significantly increase its variability.  In April 2019, our Board authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock with a fair market value of up to $650 million, in addition to the amount of shares that were available for repurchase under a previous authorization. As of January 1, 2022, shares of our common stock in the aggregate amount of $359.6 million remained authorized for repurchase under this Board authorization. In 2021, we repurchased .9 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $180.9 million. Share repurchases under our repurchase program may be made through a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades or accelerated share repurchase transactions. Our share repurchase authorizations do not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares or to repurchase any specific number of shares for any fixed period. The timing and amount of repurchases, if any, are subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. Our repurchase of common stock may be limited, suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and without prior notice.  Although we increased our quarterly dividend rate by approximately 10% in April 2021, there can be no assurance that we will maintain this increased rate. Future dividends are subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. We are not obligated to continue a dividend for any fixed period, and the payment of dividends could be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and without prior notice. We will continue to retain future earnings to develop our business, as opportunities arise, and evaluate the amount and timing of future dividends based on our operating results, financial condition, capital requirements and general business conditions. The amount and timing of any future dividends may vary, and the payment of any dividend does not assure that we will pay dividends in the future.  In addition, any future repurchases of our common stock or payment of dividends, or any determination to cease repurchasing stock or paying dividends, could affect our stock price and significantly increase its variability. The existence of a share repurchase program and any future dividends could cause our stock price to be higher than it would otherwise be and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Additionally, any future    17      Table of Contents   repurchases of our common stock or payment of dividends could impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions. Although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance that it will do so because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness.  Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters  Infringing intellectual property rights of third parties or inadequately acquiring or protecting our intellectual property could harm our ability to compete or grow.  Because our products involve complex technology and chemistry, we are involved from time to time in litigation involving patents and other intellectual property. Parties have filed, and in the future may file, claims against us alleging that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We are currently party to a litigation in which ADASA Inc. (“Adasa”), an unrelated third party, alleged that certain of our RFID products infringed on its patent. We recorded a contingent liability related to this matter in the second quarter of 2021 in the amount of $26.6 million based on a jury verdict issued on May 14, 2021. For more information on this litigation, see Note 8, “Contingencies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our 2021 Annual Report. If we are ultimately held liable in the Adasa matter or are held liable for infringement in other matters, we could be required to pay damages, obtain licenses or cease making or selling certain products. There can be no assurance that licenses would be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The defense of these claims, whether or not meritorious, or the development of new technologies could cause us to incur significant costs and divert the attention of management.  We also have valuable intellectual property upon which third parties may infringe. We attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual property and proprietary information by relying on the patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws of the U.S. and other countries, as well as non-disclosure agreements. However, it may be possible for a third party to obtain our information without our authorization, independently develop similar technologies, or breach a non-disclosure agreement entered into with us. In addition, many of the countries in which we operate do not have intellectual property laws that protect proprietary rights as fully as do laws in the U.S. The use of our intellectual property by someone else without our authorization could reduce or eliminate certain competitive advantages we have, cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business. Further, the costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights could materially adversely impact our business.  We have obtained and applied for U.S. and foreign trademark registrations and patents, and will continue to evaluate whether to register additional trademarks and apply for additional patents. We cannot guarantee that any of the pending applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities. Further, we cannot assure that the validity of our patents or our trademarks will not be challenged. In addition, third parties may be able to develop competing products using technology that avoids our patents.  Unfavorable developments in legal proceedings, investigations and other legal, environmental, compliance and regulatory matters, could impact us in a materially adverse manner.  There can be no assurance that any outcome of any litigation, investigation or other legal, environmental, compliance and regulatory matter will be favorable. Our financial results could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome to pending or future litigation and investigations, and other legal, regulatory, environmental and compliance matters. See Note 8, “Contingencies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our 2021 Annual Report for more information.  We are required to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various international jurisdictions, and our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We are required to comply with the anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various international jurisdictions, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK’s Bribery Act of 2010. If we fail to comply with anti-corruption laws, we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties, including fines, monetary damages and incarceration for responsible employees and managers. In addition, if our distributors or agents fail to comply with these laws, our business may also be materially adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties.    18      Table of Contents   We are required to comply with environmental, health, and safety laws at our operations around the world. The costs of complying with these laws could materially adversely affect our business.  We are subject to national, state, provincial and/or local environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate, including those related to the disposal of hazardous waste and GHG emissions from our manufacturing processes. These laws impose liability for the costs of, and damages resulting from, cleaning up current sites, past spills, disposals and other releases of hazardous substances. These laws are often unclear and subject to the discretion of the enforcing authorities. Any failure to comply with existing and future environmental, health and safety laws could subject us to fees, penalties, costs or liabilities, impact our production capabilities, limit our ability to sell, expand or acquire facilities, and have a material adverse effect on our business. Laws and regulations related to the environment, product content and product safety are complex, change often, and can be open to different interpretations. In addition, we could be materially and adversely impacted by any environmental or product safety enforcement action affecting our suppliers, particularly in emerging markets.  We have accrued liabilities for the environmental clean-up of certain sites, including the twelve sites for which U.S. governmental agencies have designated us as a potentially responsible party as of our 2021 fiscal year-end, where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. See Note 8, “Contingencies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our 2021 Annual Report for more information. However, because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities, the actual expense to remediate currently identified sites and other sites that could be identified for cleanup in the future could be higher than the liabilities accrued.  We are subject to export and import control laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in these markets.  Export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of some of our products to embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons. While we train our employees to comply with these regulations, use third party screening software, and take other measures, we cannot guarantee that a violation will not occur. A prohibited shipment could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties, fines, civil and criminal sanctions and reputational harm. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could decrease our ability to export or sell our products internationally. Any limitation on our ability to export or sell our products could materially adversely affect our business.  Some of our products are subject to export control laws and regulations and may be exported only with an export license or through an applicable export license exception. If we fail to comply with export licensing, customs regulations, economic sanctions or other laws, we could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including economic sanctions against us, incarceration for responsible employees and managers, and the possible loss of export or import privileges. In addition, if our distributors fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be materially adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties. Obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be time consuming and expensive and could result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities.  Risks Related to Other Financial Matters  Our pension assets are significant and subject to market, interest and credit risk that may reduce their value.  Changes in the value of our pension assets, which was approximately $875 million as of January 1, 2022, could materially adversely affect our earnings and cash flows. In particular, the value of our investments may decline due to increases in interest rates or volatility in the financial markets. In addition, we may take actions to reduce the financial volatility associated with our pension liabilities, which could result in charges in the nearer term. As such, we continuously evaluate options to better manage the volatility associated with our pension liabilities. Although we mitigate these risks by investing in high quality securities, ensuring adequate diversification of our investment portfolio and monitoring our portfolio’s overall risk profile, the value of our investments may nevertheless decline. In September 2018, we terminated the Avery Dennison Pension Plan, a U.S. pension plan, and completed the settlement of the plan’s obligations in 2019. This settlement resulted in approximately $444 million of pretax charges    19      Table of Contents   in 2019, partially offset by related tax benefits of approximately $179 million. See Note 6, “Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits,” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our 2021 Annual Report for more information.  The actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods. Changes in accounting standards and government regulations could also affect our pension and postretirement plan expense and funding requirements.  We evaluate the assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our international pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans in consultation with outside actuaries. In the event that we were to determine that changes were warranted in the assumptions used, such as the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, or mortality rates, our pension and projected postretirement benefit expenses and funding requirements could increase or decrease. Because of changing market conditions or changes in the participant population, the actuarial assumptions that we use may differ from actual results, which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and related costs. Funding obligations for each plan are determined based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date as required under applicable government regulations. Our pension funding requirements, and the timing of funding payments, could also be affected by future legislation or regulation.  An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our results of operations and net worth.  Goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators are present). As of January 1, 2022, the carrying value of our goodwill was $1.88 billion. In 2021, we determined that the goodwill of our reporting units was not impaired. We review goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. In assessing fair value, we make estimates and assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates, and discount rates based on our business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying these factors. Goodwill valuations have been calculated primarily using an income approach based on the present value of projected future cash flows of each reporting unit. We could be required to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to our business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines. These types of events could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future. Impairment charges could substantially affect our business in the periods in which they are made.    20      Table of Contents"
1,AVY,AVERY DENNISON CORP,2021-02-25,">Item 1A. RISK FACTORS    The risk factors described in this section could materially adversely affect our business, including our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and cause the value of our securities to decline. This list of risks is not exhaustive. Our ability to attain our goals and objectives is dependent on numerous factors and risks, including, but not limited to, the most significant ones described in this section.  Risks Related to COVID-19  COVID-19 has had an adverse effect on portions of our business and we could experience further negative consequences as a result of COVID-19 that could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Overall, the pandemic had a negative impact on our consolidated financial results for 2020. While we experienced sequential improvements in the second half of 2020, net sales for the full year were lower across our reportable segments due to the continued negative impact of the pandemic. Net sales for the second quarter of 2020 were down approximately 15% from the same period in 2019. However, we experienced sequential improvement in the second half of the year, resulting in our net sales for the full year being down over 1% from the prior year. Our label and packaging materials largely serve essential categories and experienced strong demand as a result of the pandemic, given the increased consumption of packaged goods and e-commerce trends. Net sales of graphics and reflective products declined due to lower demand. Net sales in our Retail Branding and Information Solutions (“RBIS”) reportable segment declined significantly in the second quarter of 2020, though we experienced sequential improvement in the remainder of the year, driven by net sales growth in radio-frequency identification solutions. Additionally, net sales in our Industrial and Healthcare Materials (“IHM”) reportable segment declined significantly in the second quarter mainly due to reduced industrial demand, particularly in automotive end markets, although we experienced sequential improvement in the remainder of the year.  We are unable to predict the full impact that COVID-19 will have on our 2021 results from operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration and severity of the pandemic and containment measures and the related macroeconomic impacts. We continue to manage this dynamic environment and have updated our scenario planning to reflect the continuously evolving aspects of the pandemic.  The ability of our employees to work has been and may continue to be significantly impacted by COVID-19.  Our employees have been affected by COVID-19. Our office and management personnel in certain countries have generally worked from home since mid-March 2020, and some of our employees engaged in manufacturing, production and distribution facilities were at times restricted by governmental orders from coming to work. We have experienced, and may experience in the future, temporary facility closures in response to government mandates in certain jurisdictions in which we operate. The safety, health and well-being of our employees are our top priorities and we may need to implement further precautionary measures to help minimize the risk of our workforce being exposed to COVID-19, including securing supplies for our facilities and providing personal protective equipment for our employees. Further, our management team is focused on mitigating the adverse economic effects of COVID-19, which required and will continue to require a large investment of time and resources across our entire company, thereby diverting attention from other priorities that existed prior to the pandemic. If these conditions worsen, or last for an extended period of time, or there is a disruption in the technology we use to operate remotely, our ability to manage our business may be impaired, and operational, cybersecurity and other risks facing us prior to the pandemic may be elevated.  We cannot predict the impact of COVID-19 on our customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners, including our financing sources, and how these impacts will affect our business.  COVID-19 has affected and is likely to continue affecting our customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners, but we are not able to predict the ultimate consequences that will result. Delays in production or delivery of components or raw materials in our global supply chain, or the ability to transport those components or materials or our finished goods, due to restrictions imposed to limit the spread of COVID-19 could delay or inhibit our ability to obtain supply of components and materials to deliver finished goods to customers. While disruptions to our supply chain during fiscal year 2020 were not significant, if conditions worsen or last for an extended period of time, our supply chains could be materially adversely affected. If our sales channels were to become substantially impacted for an extended period of time, our business could be materially adversely affected. In the first quarter of 2020, our ability to access the commercial paper market was disrupted and we drew down $500 million from our revolving credit facility, which we repaid in the second quarter of 2020. If commercial paper markets or our ability to draw    6      under our $800 million revolving credit facility were disrupted in the future, our liquidity could be adversely affected.  Risk Related to Our International Operations  The demand for our products is impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic, social, political and market conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We have operations in over 50 countries and our domestic and international operations are strongly influenced by matters beyond our control, including changes in political, social, economic and labor conditions, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign earnings), and international trade regulations (including tariffs), as well as the impact of these changes on the underlying demand for our products. In 2020, approximately 76% of our net sales were from international operations.  Macroeconomic developments such as impacts from COVID-19, slower growth in the geographic regions in which we operate, the restructuring of European sovereign and other debt obligations, the impact of the exit of the United Kingdom (“UK”) from the European Union (commonly known as “Brexit”), and uncertainty in the global credit or financial markets leading to a loss of consumer confidence could result in a material adverse effect on our business as a result of, among other things, reduced consumer spending, declines in asset valuations, diminished liquidity and credit availability, volatility in securities prices, credit rating downgrades, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  We continue to face uncertainty with respect to trade relations between the U.S. and many of its trading partners. Over the past few years, the U.S. government has imposed additional tariffs on products imported into the U.S. This has resulted in reciprocal tariffs on goods imported from the U.S. into China, the European Union, and certain other countries. The impacts on our operations to date have not been significant. There remains a risk that our business could be significantly impacted if additional tariffs or other restrictions are imposed on products imported from these or other countries, or if relations with these countries more broadly deteriorate. These countries may continue to, or other countries may begin to, impose similar tariffs or restrictions on products imported from the U.S. Any of these actions or further developments in international trade relations could have a material adverse effect on our business.  In addition, business and operational disruptions or delays caused by political, social or economic instability and unrest – such as civil, political and economic disturbances in places such as the U.S., Russia, Ukraine, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, North Korea, Hong Kong, and Chile and the related impact on global stability, terrorist attacks and the potential for other hostilities, public health crises or natural disasters in various parts of the world – could contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that in turn could have material adverse effects on our business. We are not able to predict the duration and severity of adverse economic, social, political or market conditions in the U.S. or other countries.  Foreign currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in those rates, may materially adversely affect our business.  The substantial majority of our net sales in 2020 was in foreign currencies. Fluctuations in currencies, such as those associated with the Brazilian real, Indian rupee, Mexican peso, and euro in 2020, can result in a variety of negative effects, including lower net sales, increased costs, lower gross margin percentages, increased allowances for credit losses and/or write-offs of accounts receivable, and required recognition of impairments of capitalized assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets. Foreign currency translation reduced our net sales in 2020 by approximately $67 million. Margins on sales of our products in foreign countries could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.  We monitor our foreign currency exposures and may, from time to time, use hedging instruments to mitigate transactional exposure to changes in foreign currencies. The effectiveness of our hedges in part depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows, which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates. Further, hedging activities may offset only a portion, or none at all, of the material adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place and we may incur significant losses from hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility and foreign currency fluctuations.  Continued concerns regarding the short- and long-term stability of the euro and its ability to serve as a single currency for countries in the Eurozone could lead individual countries to revert, or threaten to revert, to their former local currencies, potentially dislocating the euro. If this were to occur, the assets we hold in a country that re-introduces its local currency could be significantly devalued, the cost of raw materials or our manufacturing    7        operations could substantially increase, and the demand and pricing for our products could be materially adversely affected. Furthermore, if it were to become necessary for us to conduct business in additional currencies, we could be subject to earnings volatility as amounts in these currencies are translated into U.S. dollars.  Our growth strategy includes increased concentration in emerging markets, including China, which could create greater exposure to unstable political conditions, civil unrest, economic volatility, contagious disease and other risks applicable to international operations.  A significant amount of our net sales – approximately half of our net sales in 2020 – is originated in emerging markets, including countries in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. The profitable growth of our business in emerging markets is a significant focus of our long-term growth strategy and our regional results can fluctuate significantly based on economic conditions in these regions. For example, while emerging markets contributed positively to our results in 2020, we believe that local economic conditions in certain countries negatively impacted our results for the year, most notably in India and China, largely affecting our Label and Graphic Materials (“LGM”) reportable segment and industrial and automotive production in our IHM reportable segment. Our business operations may be adversely affected by the current and future political environment in China, including as a result of its response to tariffs instituted by the U.S. government on goods imported from China, any trade agreements entered into between the U.S. and China, and tensions as a result of the two countries’ relationships with Hong Kong and Taiwan. Our ability to operate in China or other emerging markets may be adversely affected by changes in the laws and regulations of these jurisdictions or the interpretation thereof, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, raw materials, environmental regulations, land use rights, property, foreign currency conversion, the regulation of private enterprises and other matters.  In early 2020, in response to the initial outbreak of COVID-19, many of our manufacturing and other operations in China experienced limited production and/or closure; as the outbreak spread beyond this region, our facilities in other countries were similarly impacted, most significantly in South Asia. All of our manufacturing facilities are currently open, but, many of our employees are still unable to travel within and outside their countries. The pandemic and any other adverse development in emerging markets could have a material adverse effect on our business.  There could be disruptions in our supply chain or ability to manufacture our products, as well as temporary closures of our facilities or those of our suppliers or customers, any of which could impact our sales and operating results. The extent to which the pandemic will impact our financial results is dependent on future developments, which are uncertain and unpredictable. COVID-19 has adversely affected the economies and financial markets in impacted countries, and further escalation of the health crisis could potentially lead to a more significant economic downturn that could adversely affect demand for our products and negatively impact our business. COVID-19 adversely impacted our results for fiscal year 2020; while we took measures to mitigate this impact, they were unable to fully offset it.  If we are unable to successfully expand our business in emerging markets or achieve the return on capital we expect as a result of our investments in these countries, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected. In addition to the risks applicable to our international operations, factors that could have a material adverse effect on our operations in these emerging markets include the lack of well-established or reliable legal systems and possible disruptions due to unstable political conditions, civil unrest or economic volatility. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business by decreasing consumer purchasing power, reducing demand for our products or increasing our costs.  Our operations and activities outside of the U.S. may subject us to risks different from and potentially greater than those associated with our domestic operations.  A substantial portion of our employees and assets are located outside of the U.S. and, in 2020, the substantial majority of our sales was generated from customers located outside of the U.S. International operations and activities involve risks that are different from and potentially greater than the risks we face with respect to our domestic operations, including our less extensive knowledge of and relationships with contractors, suppliers, distributors and customers in certain of these markets; changes in foreign political, regulatory and economic conditions, including nationally, regionally and locally; material adverse effects of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies; inflation; reduced protection of intellectual property rights; laws and regulations impacting the ability to repatriate foreign earnings; challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to sales, operations, taxes, employment and legal proceedings; establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate our international operations and monitor compliance with U.S. laws and regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign laws and regulations, such as the UK’s Bribery Act of 2010; differences in    8        lending practices; challenges with complying with applicable export and import control laws and regulations; and differences in language, culture and time zone.  There is also continued uncertainty as to how Brexit will affect the legal and regulatory environment in the European Union and the UK, as well as whether other countries in the European Union may approve similar measures and cause further uncertainty in the region. While our operations in the UK are relatively small, the realization of any of these risks or the failure to comply with any laws or regulations in the European Union or the UK could expose us to liabilities and have a material adverse effect on our business.  Risks Related to Our Business  We are affected by changes in our markets due to competitive conditions, technological developments, environmental standards, laws and regulations, and customer preferences. If we do not compete effectively or respond appropriately to these market changes, it could reduce market demand, or we could lose market share or be forced to reduce selling prices to maintain market share, any of which could materially adversely affect our business.  We are at risk that existing or new competitors, which include some of our customers, distributors, and suppliers, will expand in our key market segments or develop new technologies, enhancing their competitive position relative to ours. Competitors also may be able to offer additional products, services, lower prices, or other incentives that we cannot or would not offer or that would make our products less profitable. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or new technologies.  A substantial amount of our label materials are sold for use in plastic packaging in the food, beverage, and home and personal care market segments. In recent years, there has been an accelerated focus on sustainability and transparency in reporting, with greater consumer concern regarding climate change and single-use plastics, corporate commitments and increasing stakeholder expectations regarding the reuse and recyclability of plastic packaging and recycled content, and increased regulation across multiple geographies regarding the collection, recycling and use of recycled content. We are at risk that changes in consumer preferences or laws and regulations related to the use of plastics could reduce demand for our products. We have developed new products to advance the circular economy and address the need for increased recyclability of plastic packaging, and are developing new solutions to address this challenge in collaboration with our customers and the businesses in our supply chain. These efforts may result in additional costs and there can be no assurance that they will be successful, and a significant reduction in the use of plastic packaging could materially adversely affect demand for our products.  The scientific consensus is that the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) is altering the composition of our atmosphere in ways that are adversely affecting global climate. Concern regarding climate change has led and is likely to continue to lead to increasing demands by legislators and regulators, customers, shareholders and non-governmental organizations for companies to reduce their GHG emissions. In 2015, we set a goal to achieve at least a 3% absolute reduction in our GHG emissions year-over-year and at least a 26% absolute reduction, compared to our 2015 baseline, by 2025. We have already exceeded our overall 2025 goal and have set a more ambitious goal for 2030. We could face risks to our reputation, investor confidence and market share if we are unable to decrease our GHG emissions. Increased raw material costs, such as fuel and electricity, and compliance-related costs could also impact customer demand for our products. The potential impact of climate change on our business is uncertain, as it will depend on the limits imposed by, and timing of, new or stricter laws and regulations, more stringent environmental standards and expectations, and evolving customer preferences, but it could increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our business.  We also are at risk to changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases, which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in our incentive programs, or changes in the customer’s ability to achieve incentive targets. Changes in customers’ preferences for our products can also affect demand for our products and a decline in demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our business. The impact is expected to continue into 2021 but improve as economies gradually recover.  We have recently acquired companies and are likely to acquire other companies. Acquisitions come with significant risks and uncertainties, including those related to integration, technology and employees.  To grow existing businesses and expand into new areas, we have made acquisitions and are likely to continue doing so. In February 2020, we completed our acquisition of Smartrac’s Transponder (RFID Inlay) Division, a manufacturer of RFID products, for approximately $255 million, and, in December 2020, we completed our acquisition of ACPO, Ltd. (“ACPO”), an Ohio-based manufacturer of self-wound (linerless) pressure-sensitive    9        overlaminate products, for approximately $88 million. In recent years, we completed the following acquisitions for an aggregate of approximately $340 million: Yongle Tape Ltd., a China-based manufacturer of specialty tapes and related products used in a variety of industrial markets; Finesse Medical Ltd., an Ireland-based manufacturer of healthcare products used in the management of wound care and skin conditions; and the net assets of Hanita Coatings Rural Cooperative Association Limited, an Israel-based pressure-sensitive manufacturer of specialty films and laminates, and stock of certain of its subsidiaries. We continue to evaluate potential acquisition targets and ensure we have a robust pipeline of opportunities.  Various risks, uncertainties, and costs are associated with acquisitions. Effective integration of systems, controls, employees, product lines, market segments, customers, suppliers, and production facilities and cost savings can be difficult to achieve and the results of integration activities are uncertain. In addition, we may not be able to retain key employees of an acquired company or successfully execute integration strategies and achieve projected performance targets for the business segment into which an acquired company is integrated. Both before and after the closing of an acquisition, our business and that of the acquired company may suffer due to uncertainty or diversion of management attention. Future acquisitions could result in increased debt, dilution, liabilities, interest expense, restructuring charges and amortization expenses related to intangible assets. There can be no assurance that acquisitions will be successful and contribute to our profitability. Further, we may not be able to identify value-accretive acquisition targets that support our strategy of increasing our exposure to high value product categories or execute additional acquisitions in the future.  As a manufacturer, our sales and profitability are dependent upon the cost and availability of raw materials and energy, which are subject to price fluctuations, and our ability to control or offset increases in raw material and labor costs. Raw material cost increases could materially adversely affect our business.  The environment for raw materials used in our businesses could become challenging and volatile, impacting availability and pricing. Additionally, energy costs can be volatile and unpredictable. Shortages and inflationary or other increases in the costs of raw materials, labor, freight and energy have occurred in the past, and could recur. In 2018, we implemented targeted price increases in our LGM reportable segment in all regions to address raw material inflation that moderated in 2019. If we experience an inflationary trend in the future, we may implement similar pricing measures. Our performance depends in part on our ability to offset cost increases for raw materials by raising our selling prices or re-engineering our products.  Also, it is important for us to obtain timely delivery of materials, equipment, and other resources from suppliers, and to make timely delivery to customers. We may experience supply chain interruptions due to natural and other disasters or other events, such as COVID-19, or our existing relationships with suppliers could be terminated in the future. Any such disruption to our supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability, and any sustained interruption in our receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on our business.  A significant consolidation of our customer base could negatively impact our business.  A significant consolidation of our customer base could negatively impact our business. For example, some converter customers served by our LGM reportable segment have consolidated and integrated vertically. Some of our largest customers have acquired companies with similar or complementary product lines. This consolidation could increase the concentration of our business with our largest customers. Further consolidation may be accompanied by pressure from customers for lower prices. While we generally have been successful at managing customer consolidations, increased pricing pressures from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Because some of our products are sold by third parties, our business depends in part on the financial health of these parties and their customers.  Some of our products are sold not only by us, but also by third-party distributors. Some of our distributors also market products that compete with our products. Changes in the financial or business conditions, including economic weakness, market trends or industry consolidation, or the purchasing decisions of these third parties or their customers could materially adversely affect our business.  We outsource some of our manufacturing. If there are significant changes in the quality control or financial or business condition of these outsourced manufacturers, our business could be negatively impacted.  We manufacture most of our products, but we also occasionally use third-party manufacturers to optimize production efficiencies, manage capacity overflow, and produce specialty jobs, most significantly in our RBIS    10             reportable segment. Outsourcing manufacturing reduces our ability to prevent product quality issues, late deliveries, customer dissatisfaction and noncompliance with customer requirements. While we have robust onboarding processes and continually assess the performance of these outsourced manufacturers, we may experience quality issues and customer dissatisfaction that could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Our reputation, sales, and earnings could be materially adversely affected if the quality of our products and services does not meet customer expectations. In addition, product liability claims or regulatory actions could materially adversely affect our business or reputation.  There are occasions when we experience product quality issues resulting from defective materials, manufacturing, packaging or design. These issues are often discovered before shipping, causing delays in shipping, delays in the manufacturing process, and occasionally cancelled orders. When issues are discovered after shipment, they may result in additional shipping costs, discounts, refunds, or loss of future sales. Both pre-shipping and post-shipping quality issues could have material adverse effects on our business and negatively impact our reputation.  Claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of our products arise in the ordinary course of our business. In addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments and penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our business, product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation in the marketplace and the value of our brands. We also could be required to recall and possibly discontinue the sale of potentially defective or unsafe products, which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses. Although we maintain product liability insurance coverage, potential product liability claims are subject to a deductible or may not be covered under the terms of the policy.  Changes in our business strategies may increase our costs and could affect the profitability of our businesses.  As our business environment changes, including as a result of COVID-19, we have adjusted and may need to further adjust our business strategies or restructure our operations or particular businesses. For example, we have initiated restructuring and investment actions across our businesses designed to increase profitability, with the reduction of positions and assets at numerous locations across our company, which primarily included actions in our LGM and RBIS reportable segments. The actions in LGM were primarily associated with the consolidations of operations in North America and its graphics business in Europe, in part in response to COVID-19. The actions in RBIS primarily related to global headcount and footprint reduction, with some actions accelerated and expanded in response to COVID-19. We have also reduced costs across our company in response to COVID-19, approximately $135 million of which we believe to be temporary, meaning that we anticipate the majority of these costs to return as markets recover. As we continue to develop and adjust our growth strategies, we may invest in new businesses that have short-term returns that are negative or low and whose ultimate business prospects are uncertain or could prove unprofitable. We cannot provide assurance that we will achieve the intended results of any of our business strategies, which involve operational complexities, consume management attention and require substantial resources and effort. If we fail to achieve the intended results of such actions, our costs could increase, our assets could be impaired, and our returns on investments could be lower.  If we are unable to develop and successfully market new products and applications, we could compromise our competitive position.  The timely introduction of new products and improvements to current products helps determine our success. Many of our current products are the result of our research and development efforts, for which we expensed $113 million in 2020. These efforts are directed primarily toward developing new products and operating techniques and improving product performance, often in close association with our customers or end users. These efforts include patent and product development work relating to printing and coating technologies, as well as adhesive, release and ink chemistries in our LGM and IHM segments. We focus on research projects related to RFID and external embellishments in our RBIS segment and medical technologies in our IHM segment, for which we have and license a number of patents. Additionally, our research and development efforts include sustainable innovation and design of products that increase the use of recycled content, reduce waste, extend life or enable recycling. Research and development is complex and uncertain, requiring innovation and anticipation of market trends. We could focus on products that ultimately are not accepted by customers or end users or we could suffer delays in the production or launch of new products that may not lead to the recovery of our research and development expenditures and, as a result, could compromise our competitive position.    11        Misassessment of our infrastructure needs could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We recently increased our pace of capital investment to support our long-term growth and margin expansion plans. We may not be able to recoup the costs of our infrastructure investments if actual demand is not as we anticipate. In recent years, we expanded LGM’s manufacturing facilities located in emerging markets and a location in Indiana; moved our RBIS Vietnam business into a new, expanded facility; closed an LGM facility in Germany and consolidated those operations with operations in Luxembourg and Belgium; and made additional investments in capacity to support growth in our U.S. graphics business, our label and packaging materials businesses in Luxembourg and Ohio, and in both capacity and business development globally for our Intelligent Labels RFID platform. We also transferred our IHM’s European medical capacity from Belgium to Ireland. In addition, we added capacity through our acquisitions of Yongle Tapes, Hanita Coatings, Finesse Medical, Smartrac and ACPO. Infrastructure investments, which are long-term in nature, may not generate the expected return due to changes in the marketplace, failures in execution, and other factors. Significant changes from our expected need for and/or returns on our infrastructure investments could materially adversely affect our business.  Our profitability may be materially adversely affected if we generate less productivity improvement than projected.  We engage in restructuring actions, including as a result of COVID-19, intended to reduce our costs and increase efficiencies across our business segments. We intend to continue efforts to reduce costs in all our businesses, which have in the past included, and may continue to include, facility closures and square footage reductions, headcount reductions, organizational restructuring, process standardization, and manufacturing relocation. The consolidation of LGM’s graphics business in Europe and global headcount and footprint reduction in RBIS are examples of these activities. We had incremental savings from restructuring actions, net of transition costs, of $65 million in fiscal year 2020. The success of these efforts is not assured and targeted savings may not be realized. In addition, cost reduction actions can result in restructuring charges and could expose us to production risk, loss of sales and employee turnover. In addition, net temporary cost savings of approximately $135 million partially offset the negative impact of COVID-19 on volume in 2020. Cost saving actions included deferrals of planned compensation increases, hiring freezes, overtime and temporary labor reductions, shift reductions and furloughs, temporary production shutdowns, and travel and other discretionary spending reductions. In addition, we benefitted from lower incentive compensation costs in 2020 as a result of the impact of COVID-19 on our business. These actions partially offset the negative impact on our business resulting from COVID-19, but were not sufficient to fully offset it. Some of these temporary cost reductions are expected to return in 2021, which would increase our costs, in connection with growth or other changes in our business.  Difficulty in the collection of receivables as a result of economic conditions or other market factors could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Although we have processes to administer credit granted to customers and believe our allowance for credit losses is adequate, we have experienced losses – including an approximately 65% increase in our allowance for credit losses from approximately $27 million to approximately $45 million in the 2020 as a result of COVID-19 – and in the future may experience losses as a result of our inability to collect some of our accounts receivable. The financial difficulties of a customer could result in reduced business with that customer. We may also assume higher credit risk relating to receivables of a customer experiencing financial difficulty. If these developments were to occur, our inability to collect on our accounts receivable from major customers could substantially reduce our cash flows and income and have a material adverse effect on our business.  Risks Related to Income Taxes  Changes in our tax rates could affect our earnings.  Our effective tax rate in any period can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation. There can be no assurance that any of these changes would not have a material adverse effect on our business.  Potential tax liabilities related to future changes in U.S. tax legislation could materially impact our business.  Our results of operations and cash flows from operating activities may be materially adversely affected if U.S. tax rules change. For example, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) enacted in December 2017 remains subject to further amendments, interpretations, and regulations, any of which could impact our effective tax rate.    12        Moreover, the two legislative chambers of Congress and the presidency are now controlled by the same political party, enabling a path to potentially raise tax revenue from an increase in corporate tax rates through new tax legislation. The impact and timing of such potential changes are uncertain and may materially impact our effective tax rate.  The enactment of legislation implementing changes in taxation of international business activities, adoption of other corporate tax reform policies, or other changes in tax legislation or policies could materially and adversely impact our business.  Corporate tax reform, prevention of base-erosion and tax transparency continue to be high priorities of many tax jurisdictions worldwide. As a result, policies regarding corporate income and other taxes are under heightened scrutiny globally, while tax reform legislation has been proposed or enacted in a number of jurisdictions.  In addition, many countries have enacted, or plan to enact, legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”) recommendations and action plans, which aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, with changes to cross-border tax, transfer-pricing documentation rules, and nexus-based tax incentive practices. Moreover, the OECD Inclusive Framework on BEPS has released a series of documents that addresses the tax challenges arising from digitalization of the economy. As a result of heightened scrutiny of corporate taxation policies, prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to enforcement activities or legislative investigation and inquiry, which could also result in changes in tax policies or prior tax rulings. Any such changes in policies or rulings may result in the taxes we previously paid being subject to change.  Due to the large scale of our international business activities, any substantial change in international corporate tax policies, enforcement activities or legislative initiatives could have a material adverse effect on the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our business generally.  Our inability to retain or renew certain tax incentives in foreign jurisdictions could materially adversely affect our business.  Our effective tax rate reflects benefits from concessionary tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions based on the geographic location of our manufacturing activities, the industries that we serve, or the business model under which we operate. If we do not meet the criteria required to retain or renew these tax incentives, our effective tax rate could materially increase.  The amount of various taxes we pay is subject to ongoing compliance requirements and audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities.  We are subject to regular examinations of our income tax returns by various tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of material adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. In addition, tax enforcement has become increasingly aggressive in recent years, including continued actions by the European Commission related to illegal state aid, with increased focus on transfer pricing and intercompany documentation. Our estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues requires significant judgment and is subject to our assessment of relevant risks, facts, and circumstances existing at the time. We use these assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and other tax-related accounts. Our results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved, which may materially adversely impact our effective tax rate and have a material adverse effect on our business.  We have deferred tax assets that we may not be able to realize under certain circumstances.  If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in certain jurisdictions, or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. In addition, changes in statutory tax rates or carryforward periods allowed may change our deferred tax asset or liability balances, with either a favorable or unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate. A significant portion of our indefinite-lived net operating loss carryforwards is concentrated in Luxembourg and may require decades to be fully utilized under our current business model. Decreases in the statutory tax rate or changes in our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in Luxembourg could materially adversely affect our effective tax rate. The computation and assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets may also be materially impacted by new legislation or regulations.    13        Risks Related to Information Technology  Significant disruption to the information technology infrastructure that stores our information could materially adversely affect our business.  We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a large and complex information technology infrastructure to link our global business. Like other information technology systems, ours is susceptible to a number of risks including, but not limited to, damage or interruptions resulting from obsolescence, natural disasters, power failures, human error, viruses, social engineering, phishing, ransomware or other malicious attacks and data security breaches. We upgrade and install new systems, which, if installed or programmed incorrectly or on a delayed timeframe, could cause delays or cancellations of customer orders, impede the manufacture or shipment of products, or disrupt the processing of transactions. For example, we have invested in information technology to upgrade the systems in both our LGM North America business and RBIS reportable segment to drive efficiency and supply chain productivity. Processes affected by these implementations included, among other things, order management, pricing, shipping, purchasing, supply chain and financial reporting. In 2020, we made structural changes to our IT organization to drive efficiencies, implement new ways of working, and improve our agility, among other things. We have implemented measures to mitigate our risk related to system and network disruptions, but if a disruption were to occur, we could incur significant losses and remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, we rely on services provided by third-party vendors for certain information technology processes – including system infrastructure management, application management, and software as service – which makes our operations vulnerable to a failure by any one of these vendors to perform adequately or maintain effective internal controls.  Security breaches could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which could cause our business and reputation to suffer.  We maintain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form, which is stored in data centers and on our networks and third-party cloud services, including confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations. Data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering and theft. We develop and maintain systems to prevent this from occurring, but the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly sophisticated. Moreover, despite our efforts, the possibility of intrusion, tampering and theft cannot be eliminated entirely. Our information technology and infrastructure may become vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Additionally, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business objectives. While we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and, where appropriate, assess the protections utilized by these third parties, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised.  Any such breach or attack could compromise our network, the network of a third party to whom we have disclosed confidential, proprietary or personal information, a data center where we have stored such information or a third-party cloud service provider, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, impair our ability to conduct business, or result in the loss or diminished value of profitable opportunities and the loss of revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property. Contractual provisions with third parties, including cloud service providers, may limit our ability to recover these losses. If personal information of our customers or employees were to be misappropriated, we could incur costs to compensate our customers or employees or pay damages or fines as a result of litigation or regulatory actions and our reputation with our customers and employees could be injured, resulting in loss of business or decline in morale. Data privacy legislation and regulation have been increasing in recent years – including, for example, the General Data Protection Regulation in the EU, the Cyber Security Law in China, the General Data Protection Law in Brazil and the state of California’s Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 – and although we have made reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to regulatory action in the event of an incident.  Although we have experienced some security incidents that did not have a significant or material adverse effect on our business, this may not be the case in the future. We have taken many steps to further improve the security of our networks and computer systems, including conducting employee security awareness training and phishing exercises to protect against social engineering and inadvertent or intentional disclosure of data; implementing multi-   14        factor authentication and advanced malware detection measures; upgrading legacy information technology systems to simplify and standardize business processes and applications; continuously improving information technology project and portfolio management discipline, using metrics and reviews and implementing appropriate mitigation measures; establishing a data loss prevention framework to better identify and protect our critical data; conducting third party penetration testing to assess the effectiveness of our cybersecurity, network and site access controls; removing USB drive access across our company; and improving our capabilities based on threat intelligence and the publicized incidents experienced by other companies, as well as ones that we have experienced despite their minimal operational or financial impact to date. We regularly review the effectiveness of our cybersecurity preparedness program using an industry standard cybersecurity framework and best practices (e.g., ISO27000, NIST 800). Despite these and other mitigation efforts, there can be no assurance that we have fully protected our information, that third parties to whom we have disclosed such information or with whom we have stored such information (in data centers and on the cloud) are taking similar precautions, or that we will not experience future hacking or intrusion attempts.  Risks Related to Human Capital  For us to remain competitive, it is important to recruit and retain our key management and highly-skilled employees. We also utilize various outsourcing arrangements for certain services, and related delays, resource availability, or errors by these service providers may lead to increased costs or disruption in our business.  There is significant competition to recruit and retain key management and highly-skilled employees. In particular, due to our expansion to additional geographies and ongoing productivity efforts and recent employee restructuring actions, it may be difficult for us to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of highly-skilled employees. We may also be unable to recruit and retain key management and highly-skilled employees if we do not offer market-competitive employment and compensation terms. If we fail to recruit or retain our key management or sufficient numbers of highly-skilled employees, we could experience disruption in our businesses and difficulties managing our operations and implementing our business strategy.  Executive succession planning is also important to our long-term success. We experienced several recent key management changes, including promotions of long-serving and experienced leaders to the positions of Chief Human Resources Officer and Chief Legal Officer in 2020. In addition, the President of our LGM reportable segment ceased serving in that capacity at the end of 2019. While we believe we have appropriate leadership development programs and succession plans in place, any failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving our key management or other highly-skilled employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.  In addition, we have outsourced certain services to third-party service providers, and may outsource other services in the future to achieve cost savings and operating efficiencies. Service provider delays, resource availability, business issues or errors may disrupt our businesses and/or increase costs. If we do not effectively develop, implement and manage outsourcing relationships, if third-party providers do not perform effectively or in a timely manner, or if we experience problems with transitioning work to a third party, we may not be able to achieve our expected cost savings, and may experience delays or incur additional costs to correct errors made by these service providers.  We have various non-U.S. collective labor arrangements, which make us subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our business.  Work interruptions or stoppages could significantly impact the volume of products we have available for sale. In addition, collective bargaining agreements, union contracts and labor laws may impair our ability to reduce labor costs by closing or downsizing manufacturing facilities because of limitations on personnel and salary changes and similar restrictions. A work stoppage at one or more of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, if any of our customers were to experience a work stoppage, that customer may halt or limit purchases of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Similarly, if any of our suppliers were to experience a work stoppage, they could halt or limit supplies of products necessary for us to conduct our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Risks Related to Our Indebtedness  If our indebtedness increases significantly or our credit ratings are downgraded, we may have difficulty obtaining acceptable short- and long-term financing.  At January 2, 2021, we had approximately $2.12 billion of debt. Our overall level of indebtedness and credit ratings are significant factors in our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing. Higher debt levels could negatively impact our ability to meet other business needs and could result in higher financing costs. The credit    15        ratings assigned to us also impact the interest rates paid. A downgrade of our short-term credit ratings could impact our ability to access the commercial paper markets and increase our borrowing costs. If our access to commercial paper markets were to become limited, as they were in March 2020 as a result of COVID-19, and we were required to obtain short-term funding under our revolving credit facility or our other credit facilities, we would face increased exposure to variable interest rates.  An increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business.  In 2020, our average variable-rate borrowings were approximately $338 million. Increases in short-term interest rates would directly impact the amount of interest we pay. Fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs and have a material adverse effect on our business.  In response to the last global economic recession, extraordinary monetary policy actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banking institutions, including the utilization of quantitative easing, were taken to create and maintain a low interest rate environment. Over the past few years, the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised its benchmark interest rate, though more recently it lowered its benchmark interest rate, which, as of January 2, 2021 was between 0% and 0.25%. It is possible that increases could occur in the future, which may result in significantly higher long-term interest rates. Such a transition may, among other things, reduce the availability and/or increase the costs of obtaining new debt and refinancing existing indebtedness, and negatively impact our stock price.  The alteration or discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) may adversely affect our borrowing costs.  As of January 2, 2021, approximately $59 million of our outstanding indebtedness bears interest at variable interest rates, none of which is based on LIBOR; however, our revolving credit facility is based on LIBOR. In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. As a result, the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. Although we do not believe the risk to be significant for us, if LIBOR ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating LIBOR change from their current form, our borrowing costs could increase.  Our current and future debt covenants may limit our flexibility.  Our credit facilities and the indentures governing our medium- and long-term notes contain, and any of our future indebtedness likely would contain, restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us. Among other things, these covenants restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, incur certain liens on our assets, make certain investments, sell our assets or merge with third parties, and enter into certain transactions. We are also required to maintain specified financial ratios under certain conditions. These restrictive covenants and ratios in our existing debt agreements and any future financing agreements may limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain activities and transactions that may be in our long-term best interests and could place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors, which could materially adversely affect our business.  Risk Related to Ownership of Our Stock  Our stock price may be subject to significant variability.  Changes in our stock price may affect our access to, or cost of financing from, capital markets and may affect our stock-based compensation arrangements, among other things. Our stock price, which increased significantly in 2019 and 2020 after having experienced a decline in 2018, is influenced by changes in the overall stock market and demand for equity securities in general, as seen in 2020, due in part to the impact of COVID-19. Other factors, including our financial performance on an absolute basis and relative to our peers and competitors, as well as market expectations of our performance, the level of perceived growth of our industries, and other company-specific factors, can also materially adversely affect our stock price. There can be no assurance that our stock price will not experience significant variability in the future.  In any period in which our stock price is higher than the grant price of the stock-based compensation vesting or being exercised in that period, we are required to recognize excess tax benefits that would decrease our effective tax rate. Conversely, if our stock price is lower than the grant price of the stock-based compensation vesting or being exercised in that period, we are required to recognize tax charges that would increase our effective tax rate. This tax effect is dependent on our stock price and there can be no assurance that we will recognize similar levels of excess tax benefits in future years.    16        We cannot guarantee that we will continue to repurchase shares of our common stock or pay dividends on our common stock or that repurchases will enhance long-term stockholder value. Changes in our levels of stock repurchases or dividends could affect our stock price and significantly increase its variability.  In April 2019, our Board authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock with a fair market value of up to $650 million, in addition to the amount of shares that were available for repurchase under a previous authorization. As of January 2, 2021, shares of our common stock in the aggregate amount of $540.4 million remained authorized for repurchase under this Board authorization. In March 2020, we paused our share repurchase activity in response to COVID-19 after buying approximately $45 million of our stock in the quarter. We resumed repurchases late in the third quarter of 2020, resulting in the repurchase of shares in the aggregate amount of $104.3 million in fiscal year 2020. Share repurchases under our repurchase program may be made through a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades or accelerated share repurchase transactions. Our share repurchase authorizations do not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares or to repurchase any specific number of shares for any fixed period. The timing and amount of repurchases, if any, are subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. Our repurchase of common stock may be limited, suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and without prior notice.  Although we increased our quarterly dividend rate by approximately 7% in October 2020, having earlier in the year maintained it due to the impact of COVID-19, there can be no assurance that we will maintain this increased rate. Additionally, any future dividends that may be declared and paid from time to time are subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. We are not obligated to continue a dividend for any fixed period, and the payment of dividends could be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and without prior notice. We will continue to retain future earnings to develop our business, as opportunities arise, and evaluate on a quarterly basis the amount and timing of future dividends based on our operating results, financial condition, capital requirements and general business conditions. The amount and timing of any future dividends may vary, and the payment of any dividend does not assure that we will pay dividends in the future.  In addition, any future repurchases of our common stock or payment of dividends, or any determination to cease repurchasing stock or paying dividends, could affect our stock price and significantly increase its variability. The existence of a share repurchase program and any future dividends could cause our stock price to be higher than it would otherwise be and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Additionally, any future repurchases of our common stock or payment of dividends could impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions. Although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance that it will do so because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce our program’s effectiveness.  Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters  Infringing intellectual property rights of third parties or inadequately acquiring or protecting our intellectual property could harm our ability to compete or grow.  Because our products involve complex technology and chemistry, we are involved from time to time in litigation involving patents and other intellectual property. Parties have filed, and in the future may file, claims against us alleging that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. If we were held liable for infringement, we could be required to pay damages, obtain licenses or cease making or selling certain products. There can be no assurance that licenses would be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The defense of these claims, whether or not meritorious, or the development of new technologies could cause us to incur significant costs and divert the attention of management.  We also have valuable intellectual property upon which third parties may infringe. We attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual property and proprietary information by relying on the patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws of the U.S. and other countries, as well as non-disclosure agreements. However, it may be possible for a third party to obtain our information without our authorization, independently develop similar technologies, or breach a non-disclosure agreement entered into with us. In addition, many of the countries in which we operate do not have intellectual property laws that protect proprietary rights as fully as do laws in the U.S. The use of our intellectual property by someone else without our authorization could reduce or eliminate certain    17        competitive advantages we have, cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business. Further, the costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights could materially adversely impact our business.  We have obtained and applied for U.S. and foreign trademark registrations and patents, and will continue to evaluate whether to register additional trademarks and apply for additional patents. We cannot guarantee that any of the pending applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities. Further, we cannot assure that the validity of our patents or our trademarks will not be challenged. In addition, third parties may be able to develop competing products using technology that avoids our patents.  Unfavorable developments in legal proceedings, investigations and other legal, environmental, compliance and regulatory matters, could impact us in a materially adverse manner.  There can be no assurance that any outcome of any litigation, investigation or other legal, environmental, compliance and regulatory matter will be favorable. Our financial results could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome to pending or future litigation and investigations, and other legal, environmental, compliance and regulatory matters. See Note 8, “Contingencies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our 2020 Annual Report for more information.  We are required to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various international jurisdictions, and our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We are required to comply with the anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various international jurisdictions, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK’s Bribery Act of 2010. If we fail to comply with anti-corruption laws, we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties, including regulatory fines, monetary damages and incarceration for responsible employees and managers. In addition, if our distributors or agents fail to comply with these laws, our business may also be materially adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties.  We are required to comply with environmental, health, and safety laws at our operations around the world. The costs of complying with these laws could materially adversely affect our business.  We are subject to national, state, provincial and/or local environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad, including those related to the disposal of hazardous waste and the emission of greenhouse gases from our manufacturing processes. These laws impose liability for the costs of, and damages resulting from, cleaning up current sites, past spills, disposals and other releases of hazardous substances. These laws are often unclear and subject to the discretion of the enforcing authorities. Any failure to comply with existing and future environmental, health and safety laws could subject us to fees, penalties, costs or liabilities, impact our production capabilities, limit our ability to sell, expand or acquire facilities, and have a material adverse effect on our business. Laws and regulations related to the environment, product content and product safety are complex, change often, and can be open to different interpretations. In addition, we could be materially and adversely impacted by any environmental or product safety enforcement action affecting our suppliers, particularly in emerging markets.  We have accrued liabilities for the environmental clean-up of certain sites, including the twelve sites for which U.S. governmental agencies have designated us as a potentially responsible party as of our 2020 fiscal year-end, where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. See Note 8, “Contingencies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our 2020 Annual Report for more information. However, because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities, the actual expense to remediate currently identified sites and other sites that could be identified for cleanup in the future could be higher than the liabilities accrued.  We are subject to export and import control laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in these markets.  Export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of some of our products to embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons. While we train our employees to comply with these regulations, use third party screening software, and take other measures, we cannot guarantee that a violation will not occur. A prohibited shipment could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties, fines, civil and criminal sanctions and reputational harm. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could decrease our ability to export or sell our products    18        internationally. Any limitation on our ability to export or sell our products could materially adversely affect our business.  Some of our products are subject to export control laws and regulations and may be exported only with an export license or through an applicable export license exception. If we fail to comply with export licensing, customs regulations, economic sanctions or other laws, we could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including economic sanctions against us, incarceration for responsible employees and managers, and the possible loss of export or import privileges. In addition, if our distributors fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be materially adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties. Obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be time consuming and expensive and could result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities.  Risks Related to Other Financial Matters  Our pension assets are significant and subject to market, interest and credit risk that may reduce their value.  Changes in the value of our pension assets could materially adversely affect our earnings and cash flows. In particular, the value of our investments may decline due to increases in interest rates or volatility in the financial markets. In addition, we may take actions to reduce the financial volatility associated with our pension liabilities, which could result in charges in the nearer term. As such, we continuously evaluate options to better manage the volatility associated with our pension liabilities. Although we mitigate these risks by investing in high quality securities, ensuring adequate diversification of our investment portfolio and monitoring our portfolio’s overall risk profile, the value of our investments may nevertheless decline. In September 2018, we terminated the Avery Dennison Pension Plan, a U.S. pension plan, and completed the settlement of the plan’s obligations in 2019. This settlement in 2019 resulted in approximately $444 million of pretax charges in 2019, partially offset by related tax benefits of approximately $179 million. See Note 6, “Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits,” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our 2020 Annual Report for more information.  The level of returns on our pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods. Changes in accounting standards and government regulations could also affect our pension and postretirement plan expense and funding requirements.  We evaluate the assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our international pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans in consultation with outside actuaries. In the event that we were to determine that changes were warranted in the assumptions used, such as the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, or mortality rates, our pension and projected postretirement benefit expenses and funding requirements could increase or decrease. Because of changing market conditions or changes in the participant population, the actuarial assumptions that we use may differ from actual results, which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and related costs. Funding obligations for each plan are determined based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date as required under applicable government regulations. Our pension funding requirements, and the timing of funding payments, could also be affected by future legislation or regulation.  An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our results of operations and net worth.  Goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators are present). As of January 2, 2021, the carrying value of our goodwill was $1.14 billion. In 2020, we determined that the goodwill of our reporting units was not impaired. We review goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. In assessing fair value, we make estimates and assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates, and discount rates based on our business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying these factors. Goodwill valuations have been calculated primarily using an income approach based on the present value of projected future cash flows of each reporting unit. We could be required to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to our business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines. These types of events could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future. Impairment charges could substantially affect our business in the periods in which they are made.    19"
8,AVY,AVERY DENNISON CORP,2020-02-26,"   RISK FACTORSThe risk factors described in this section, as well as the matters generally described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated herein by reference, could materially adversely affect our business, including our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and cause the value of our securities to decline. This list of risks is not exhaustive. Our ability to attain our goals and objectives is dependent on numerous factors and risks, including, but not limited to, the most significant ones described in this section.The demand for our products is impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic, political and market conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.In 2019, approximately 77% of our sales were from international operations. We have operations in over 50 countries and our domestic and international operations are strongly influenced by matters beyond our control, including changes in political, social, economic and labor conditions, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign earnings), and international trade regulations (including tariffs), as well as the impact of these changes on the underlying demand for our products.Macroeconomic developments such as slower growth in the geographic regions in which we operate, the restructuring of European sovereign and other debt obligations, the impact of the United Kingdom’s (“UK’s”) exit from the European Union on January 31, 2020 (commonly known as “Brexit”), and uncertainty in the global credit or financial markets leading to a loss of consumer confidence could result in a material adverse effect on our business as a result of, among other things, reduced consumer spending, declines in asset valuations, diminished liquidity and credit availability, volatility in securities prices, credit rating downgrades, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Fluctuations in currencies, such as those associated with the euro, Chinese Yuan (renminbi), and Brazilian real in 2019, can result in a variety of negative effects, including lower revenues, increased costs, lower gross margin percentages, increased allowances for doubtful accounts and/or write-offs of accounts receivable, and required recognition of impairments of capitalized assets, including goodwill and other intangibles.We continue to face uncertainty with respect to trade relations between the U.S. and many of its trading partners. Over the past few years, the U.S. government has imposed additional tariffs on products imported into the U.S. This has resulted in reciprocal tariffs on goods imported from the U.S. into China, the European Union, Mexico, Canada, and certain other countries. The impacts on our operations to date have been insignificant although there was some volatility in the timing of purchases by the retailers served by our RBIS segment in light of trade-related uncertainty during 2019.  There remains a significant risk that additional tariffs or other restrictions could be imposed on products imported from these or other countries, or that relations with these countries could more broadly deteriorate. These countries may continue to retaliate by imposing similar tariffs or restrictions on products imported from the U.S. Any of these actions or further developments in international trade relations could have a material adverse effect on our business.4Table of ContentsIn addition, business and operational disruptions or delays caused by political, social or economic instability and unrest – such as civil, political and economic disturbances in places such as Russia, Ukraine, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, North Korea, Hong Kong, and Chile and the related impact on global stability, terrorist attacks and the potential for other hostilities, public health crises or natural disasters in various parts of the world – could contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that in turn could have material adverse effects on our business. We are not able to predict the duration and severity of adverse economic, political or market conditions in the U.S. or other countries. Foreign currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in those rates, may materially adversely affect our business.The substantial majority of our sales in 2019 was in foreign currencies. We are subject to fluctuations in foreign currencies, such as the euro and the Chinese Yuan (renminbi), which can cause transaction, translation and other losses, and could negatively impact our sales and profitability.  Margins on sales of our products in foreign countries could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.  We monitor our foreign currency exposures and may, from time to time, use hedging instruments to mitigate transactional exposure to changes in foreign currencies. The effectiveness of our hedges in part depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows, which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates.  Further, hedging activities may offset only a portion, or none at all, of the material adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place and we may incur significant losses from hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility and foreign currency fluctuations.Continued concerns regarding the short- and long-term stability of the euro and its ability to serve as a single currency for countries in the Eurozone could lead individual countries to revert, or threaten to revert, to their former local currencies, potentially dislocating the euro. If this were to occur, the assets we hold in a country that re-introduces its local currency could be significantly devalued, the cost of raw materials or our manufacturing operations could substantially increase, and the demand and pricing for our products could be materially adversely affected. Furthermore, if it were to become necessary for us to conduct business in additional currencies, we could be subject to earnings volatility as amounts in these currencies are translated into U.S. dollars.We are affected by changes in our markets due to competitive conditions, technological developments, laws and regulations, and customer preferences. If we do not compete effectively or respond appropriately to these market changes, it could reduce market demand, or we could lose market share or be forced to reduce selling prices to maintain market share, any of which could materially adversely affect our business. We are at risk that existing or new competitors, which include some of our customers, distributors, and suppliers, will expand in our key market segments or develop new technologies, enhancing their competitive position relative to ours.  Competitors also may be able to offer additional products, services, lower prices, or other incentives that we cannot or would not offer or that would make our products less profitable.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or new technologies. A substantial amount of our label materials are sold for use in plastic packaging in the food, beverage, and home and personal care market segments.  In recent years, there has been an accelerated focus on sustainability and transparency in reporting, with greater consumer concern regarding climate change and single-use plastics, corporate commitments regarding the reuse and recyclability of plastic packaging and recycled content, and increased regulation across multiple geographies regarding the collection, recycling and use of recycled content.  We are at risk that changes in consumer preferences or laws and regulations related to the use of plastics could reduce demand for our products. We have developed new products to advance the circular economy and address the need for increased recyclability of plastic packaging, and are developing new solutions to address this challenge in collaboration with our customers and the businesses in our supply chain. These efforts may result in additional costs and there can be no assurance that they will be successful, and a significant reduction in the use of plastic packaging could materially adversely affect demand for our products. 5Table of ContentsWe also are at risk to changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases, which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in our incentive programs, or changes in the customer’s ability to achieve incentive targets.  Changes in customers’ preferences for our products can also affect demand for our products and a decline in demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our business.  For example, in 2019, sales growth in our LGM segment was relatively low in North America and Europe due in part to share losses related to pricing actions we took in late 2018 and early 2019 to offset higher raw material costs .Our growth strategy includes increased concentration in emerging markets, including China, which could create greater exposure to unstable political conditions, civil unrest, economic volatility, contagious disease and other risks applicable to international operations.A significant amount of our sales is derived from emerging markets, including countries in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. The profitable growth of our business in emerging markets is a significant focus of our long-term growth strategy and our regional results can fluctuate significantly based on economic conditions in these regions. For example, while China and other emerging markets continued to contribute positively to our results in 2019, we believe that local economic conditions negatively impacted our results in China for the year, most notably in our IHM segment with the decline in automotive production. Our business operations may be adversely affected by the current and future political environment in China, including as a result of its response to tariffs instituted by the U.S. government on goods imported from China and any potential trade agreement entered into between the U.S. and China. Our ability to operate in China or other emerging markets may be adversely affected by changes in the laws and regulations of these jurisdictions or the interpretation thereof, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, raw materials, environmental regulations, land use rights, property, foreign currency conversion, the regulation of private enterprises and other matters.In addition, a novel strain of coronavirus emerged in December 2019 beginning in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and, in January 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. As a result, many of our manufacturing and other operations in China experienced limited production and/or closure in early 2020. In addition, many of our employees in the region have been unable to travel within and outside of the region. This outbreak of contagious disease, as well as any other adverse public health developments – particularly in Asia where approximately 60% of our employees are located and a significant portion of our sales are generated – could have a material adverse effect on our business as our sales to customers in China (including Hong Kong) were approximately 20% of our net sales in 2019. There could be further restrictions on our ability to travel or disruptions in our supply chain or ability to manufacture our products, as well as temporary closures of our facilities or those of our suppliers or customers, any of which could impact our sales and operating results. Although the outbreak originated in China, cases have been confirmed in other countries as well. The extent to which the novel coronavirus will impact our results is dependent on future developments, which are uncertain and unpredictable.  Any widespread health crisis could adversely affect the economies and financial markets in impacted countries, potentially leading to an economic downturn that could adversely affect demand for our products and negatively impact our business. We expect that the coronavirus will adversely impact our first quarter and full year 2020 results; while we will take measures to try to mitigate this impact, there can be no assurance that these actions will be able to partially or fully offset the impact.If we are unable to successfully expand our business in emerging markets or achieve the return on capital we expect as a result of our investments in these countries, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected. In addition to the risks applicable to our international operations, factors that could have a material adverse effect on our operations in these emerging markets include the lack of well-established or reliable legal systems and possible disruptions due to unstable political conditions, civil unrest or economic volatility. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business by decreasing consumer purchasing power, reducing demand for our products or increasing our costs.6Table of ContentsOur operations and activities outside of the U.S. may subject us to risks different from and potentially greater than those associated with our domestic operations.A substantial portion of our employees and assets are located outside of the U.S. and, in 2019, the substantial majority of our sales was generated from customers located outside of the U.S. International operations and activities involve risks that are different from and potentially greater than the risks we face with respect to our domestic operations, including our less extensive knowledge of and relationships with contractors, suppliers, distributors and customers in certain of these markets; changes in foreign political, regulatory and economic conditions, including nationally, regionally and locally; material adverse effects of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies; inflation; reduced protection of intellectual property rights; laws and regulations impacting the ability to repatriate foreign earnings; challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to sales, operations, taxes, employment and legal proceedings; establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate our international operations and monitor compliance with U.S. laws and regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign laws and regulations, such as the UK’s Bribery Act of 2010; differences in lending practices; challenges with complying with applicable export and import control laws and regulations; and differences in languages, cultures and time zones. There is also continued uncertainty as to how Brexit will affect the legal and regulatory environment in the European Union and the UK, as well as whether other countries in the European Union may approve similar measures and cause further uncertainty in the region.  While our operations in the UK are relatively small, the realization of any of these risks or the failure to comply with any laws or regulations in the European Union or the UK could expose us to liabilities and have a material adverse effect on our business.We have recently acquired companies and are likely to acquire other companies. Acquisitions come with significant risks and uncertainties, including those related to integration, technology and employees.To grow existing businesses and expand into new areas, we have made acquisitions and are likely to continue doing so. In recent years, we completed the acquisition of the European business of Mactac, a leading manufacturer of high-quality pressure-sensitive materials serving several graphics, specialty labels and industrial tapes segments, for $220 million. We also completed the following acquisitions for an aggregate of approximately $340 million:  Yongle Tape Ltd., a China-based manufacturer of specialty tapes and related products used in a variety of industrial markets; Finesse Medical Ltd., an Ireland-based manufacturer of healthcare products used in the management of wound care and skin conditions; and the net assets of Hanita Coatings Rural Cooperative Association Limited, an Israel-based pressure-sensitive manufacturer of specialty films and laminates, and stock of certain of its subsidiaries.  Although we did not make any acquisitions in 2019, in November 2019, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Smartrac’s Transponder (RFID Inlay) Division for approximately $250 million (€225 million), subject to certain closing and post-closing adjustments.  We expect that acquisition to be completed in the first quarter of 2020.  In addition, we continued to evaluate potential targets and ensure we have a robust pipeline of acquisition opportunities. Various risks, uncertainties, and costs are associated with acquisitions.  Effective integration of systems, controls, employees, product lines, market segments, customers, suppliers, and production facilities and cost savings can be difficult to achieve and the results of integration actions are uncertain.  In addition, we may not be able to retain key employees of an acquired company or successfully execute integration strategies and achieve projected performance targets for the business segment into which an acquired company is integrated.  Both before and after the closing of an acquisition, our business and that of the acquired company may suffer due to uncertainty or diversion of management attention.  Future acquisitions could result in debt, dilution, liabilities, increased interest expense, restructuring charges and amortization expenses related to intangible assets.  There can be no assurance that acquisitions will be successful and contribute to our profitability. Further, we may not be able to identify value-accretive targets that support our strategy of increasing our exposure to high value product categories or execute additional acquisitions in the future.7Table of ContentsAs a manufacturer, our sales and profitability are dependent upon the cost and availability of raw materials and energy, which are subject to price fluctuations, and our ability to control or offset increases in raw material and labor costs. Raw material cost increases could materially adversely affect our business. The environment for raw materials used in our businesses could become challenging and volatile, impacting availability and pricing. Additionally, energy costs can be volatile and unpredictable. Shortages and inflationary or other increases in the costs of raw materials, labor and energy have occurred in the past, and could recur. In 2018, we implemented targeted price increases in our LGM segment in all regions to address raw material inflation that moderated in 2019.  Our performance depends in part on our ability to offset cost increases for raw materials by raising our selling prices and re-engineering our products. Also, it is important for us to obtain timely delivery of materials, equipment, and other resources from suppliers, and to make timely delivery to customers.  We may experience supply chain interruptions due to natural and other disasters or other events, or our existing relationships with suppliers could be terminated in the future.  Any such disruption to our supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability, and any sustained interruption in our receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on our business. A significant consolidation of our customer base could negatively impact our business.A significant consolidation of our customer base could negatively impact our business. For example, some converter customers served by our LGM segment have consolidated and integrated vertically.  Some of our largest customers have acquired companies with similar or complementary product lines.  This consolidation could increase the concentration of our business with our largest customers.  Further consolidation may be accompanied by pressure from customers for lower prices.  While we have generally been successful at managing customer consolidations, increased pricing pressures from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business.Because some of our products are sold by third parties, our business depends in part on the financial health of these parties and their customers. Some of our products are sold not only by us, but also by third-party distributors.  Some of our distributors also market products that compete with our products.  Changes in the financial or business conditions, including economic weakness, market trends or industry consolidation, or the purchasing decisions of these third parties or their customers could materially adversely affect our business. We outsource some of our manufacturing. If there are significant changes in the quality control or financial or business condition of these outsourced manufacturers, our business could be negatively impacted. We manufacture most of our products, but we also occasionally use third-party manufacturers to optimize production efficiencies, manage capacity overflow, and produce specialty jobs, particularly in our RBIS segment.  Outsourcing manufacturing reduces our ability to prevent product quality issues, late deliveries, customer dissatisfaction and noncompliance with customer requirements.  While we have stringent onboarding processes and continuous performance assessments for these outsourced manufacturers, we may experience quality issues and customer dissatisfaction that could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our reputation, sales, and earnings could be materially adversely affected if the quality of our products and services does not meet customer expectations. In addition, product liability claims or regulatory actions could materially adversely affect our business or reputation.There are occasions when we experience product quality issues resulting from defective materials, manufacturing, packaging or design.  These issues are often discovered before shipping, causing delays in shipping, delays in the manufacturing process, and occasionally cancelled orders.  When issues are discovered after shipment, they may result in additional shipping costs, discounts, refunds, or loss of future sales.  Both pre-shipping and post-shipping quality issues could have material adverse effects on our business and negatively impact our reputation. Claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of our products arise in the ordinary course of our business. In addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments and penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our business, product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could 8Table of Contentsharm our reputation in the marketplace and the value of our brands. We also could be required to recall and possibly discontinue the sale of potentially defective or unsafe products, which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses. Although we maintain product liability insurance coverage, potential product liability claims are subject to a deductible or may not be covered under the terms of the policy.Changes in our business strategies may increase our costs and could affect the profitability of our businesses.As our business environment changes, we may need to adjust our business strategies or restructure our operations or particular businesses. We undertook a multi-year transformation of our RBIS segment focused on accelerating growth through a more regionally driven business model intended to simplify our go-to-market strategy, optimize management efficiencies and consolidate our manufacturing footprint. In addition, we have initiated restructuring and investment actions across our businesses designed to increase profitability, such as the restructuring of the European footprint of our LGM business, which began in 2018 and continued in 2019, and actions taken in our IHM segment in 2019 to improve speed, reduce complexity and lower costs. As we continue to develop and adjust our growth strategies, we may invest in new businesses that have short-term returns that are negative or low and whose ultimate business prospects are uncertain or could prove unprofitable. We cannot provide assurance that we will achieve the intended results of any of our business strategies, which involve operational complexities, consume management attention and require substantial resources and effort. If we fail to achieve the intended results of such actions, our costs could increase, our assets could be impaired, and our returns on investments could be lower.If we are unable to develop and successfully market new products and applications, we could compromise our competitive position. The timely introduction of new products and improvements to current products helps determine our success.  Many of our current products are the result of our research and development efforts. Our research efforts are directed primarily toward developing new products and operating techniques and improving product performance, often in close association with our customers or end users. These efforts include patent and product development work relating to printing and coating technologies, as well as adhesive, release and ink chemistries in our LGM and IHM segments. Additionally, we focus on research projects related to RFID and external embellishments in our RBIS segment and medical technologies in our IHM segment, for which we hold and license a number of patents. However, research and development is complex and uncertain, requiring innovation and anticipation of market trends.  We could focus on products that ultimately are not accepted by customers or end users or we could suffer delays in the production or launch of new products that may not lead to the recovery of our research and development expenditures and, as a result, could compromise our competitive position. Misassessment of our infrastructure needs could have a material adverse effect on our business. We recently increased our pace of capital investment to support our long-term growth and margin expansion plans.  We may not be able to recoup the costs of our infrastructure investments if actual demand is not as we anticipate.  In recent years, we expanded LGM’s manufacturing facilities located in emerging markets and a location in Indiana; moved our RBIS Vietnam business into a new, expanded facility; closed a LGM facility in Germany and consolidated those operations with operations in Luxembourg and Belgium; and made additional investments in capacity to support growth in our U.S. graphics business, our label and packaging materials businesses in Luxembourg and Ohio, and in both capacity and business development globally for our Intelligent Labels RFID platform.  We also are in the process of transferring our European IHM medical capacity from Belgium to Ireland.  In addition, we added capacity through our recent acquisitions of Mactac Europe, Yongle Tapes, Hanita Coatings and Finesse Medical. Infrastructure investments, which are long-term in nature, may not generate the expected return due to changes in the marketplace, failures in execution, and other factors. Significant changes from our expected need for and/or returns on our infrastructure investments could materially adversely affect our business.Our profitability may be materially adversely affected if we generate less productivity improvement than projected. We engage in restructuring actions intended to reduce our costs and increase efficiencies across our business segments.  For example, we undertook a multi-year transformation of our RBIS segment focused on accelerating growth through a more regionally driven business model intended to simplify our go-to-market strategy, optimize 9Table of Contentsmanagement efficiencies and consolidate our manufacturing footprint. We intend to continue efforts to reduce costs in all our businesses, which have in the past included, and may continue to include, facility closures and square footage reductions, headcount reductions, organizational restructuring, process standardization, and manufacturing relocation.  The restructuring of the European footprint of our LGM business, which began in 2018 and continued in 2019, and actions taken in our IHM segment to improve speed, reduce complexity and lower costs are examples of these activities. The success of these efforts is not assured and targeted savings may not be realized.  In addition, cost reduction actions could expose us to production risk, loss of sales and employee turnover. Difficulty in the collection of receivables as a result of economic conditions or other market factors could have a material adverse effect on our business. Although we have processes to administer credit granted to customers and believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate, we have experienced, and in the future may experience, losses as a result of our inability to collect some of our accounts receivable. The financial difficulties of a customer could result in reduced business with that customer. We may also assume higher credit risk relating to receivables of a customer experiencing financial difficulty. If these developments were to occur, our inability to collect on our accounts receivable from major customers could substantially reduce our cash flows and income and have a material adverse effect on our business.Changes in our tax rates could affect our earnings. Our effective tax rate in any period could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation, including, among others, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) enacted in December 2017.  The provisions of the TCJA are subject to further amendments, interpretations, and regulations, as well as the outcome of pending or future litigation, any of which could impact our tax rate.  There can be no assurance that any such changes would not have a material adverse effect on our business.The enactment of legislation implementing changes in taxation of international business activities, adoption of other corporate tax reform policies, or other changes in tax legislation or policies could materially and adversely impact our business. Corporate tax reform, prevention of base-erosion and tax transparency continue to be high priorities of many tax jurisdictions worldwide. As a result, policies regarding corporate income and other taxes are under heightened scrutiny globally, while tax reform legislation has been proposed or enacted in a number of jurisdictions. In addition, many countries have enacted, or plan to enact, legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations and action plans, which aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, with changes to cross-border tax, transfer-pricing documentation rules, and nexus-based tax incentive practices. The OECD and the European Commission continue to issue proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax liabilities are determined.  As a result of heightened scrutiny of corporate taxation policies, prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to enforcement activities or legislative investigation and inquiry, which could also result in changes in tax policies or prior tax rulings. Any such changes in policies or rulings may also result in the taxes we previously paid being subject to change.Due to the large scale of our international business activities, any substantial change in international corporate tax policies, enforcement activities or legislative initiatives could have a material adverse effect on the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our business generally.Our inability to retain or renew certain tax incentives in foreign jurisdictions could materially adversely affect our business. Our effective tax rate has reflected benefits from concessionary tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions based on the geographic location of our manufacturing activities or the industry that they serve.  If we do not meet the criteria required to retain or renew these tax incentives, our effective tax rate could increase.  Additionally, in 2019, 10Table of Contentswe completed the application for an intellectual property-based tax incentive in response to a historical tax incentive that was phased out due to a change in foreign tax law.  Our provision for income taxes in 2019 reflected the related tax benefit of this incentive based on our best estimate while our request for a tax ruling from the foreign tax authority is pending.  We continue to evaluate opportunities to optimize our future tax benefits.  The amount of various taxes we pay is subject to ongoing compliance requirements and audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are subject to regular examinations of our income tax returns by various tax authorities.  We regularly assess the likelihood of material adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes.  In addition, tax enforcement has become increasingly aggressive in recent years, including continued actions by the European Commission related to illegal state aid, with increased focus on transfer pricing and intercompany documentation.  Our estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues requires significant judgment and is subject to our assessment of relevant risks, facts, and circumstances existing at the time.  We use these assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and other tax-related accounts.  Our results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved, which may materially adversely impact our effective tax rate and have a material adverse effect on our business.  We have deferred tax assets that we may not be able to realize under certain circumstances. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in certain jurisdictions, or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets.  This would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.  In addition, changes in statutory tax rates may change our deferred tax asset or liability balances, with either a favorable or unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate.  A significant portion of our indefinite-lived net operating loss carryforwards is concentrated in Luxembourg and may require decades to be fully utilized under our current business model. Decreases in the statutory tax rate or changes in our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in Luxembourg could materially adversely affect our effective tax rate. The computation and assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets may also be materially impacted by new legislation or regulations.Significant disruption to the information technology infrastructure that stores our information could materially adversely affect our business. We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a large and complex information technology infrastructure to link our global business.  Like other information technology systems, ours is susceptible to a number of risks including, but not limited to, damage or interruptions resulting from obsolescence, natural disasters, power failures, human error, viruses, social engineering, phishing, ransomware or other malicious attacks and data security breaches.  We upgrade and install new systems, which, if installed or programmed incorrectly or on a delayed timeframe, could cause delays or cancellations of customer orders, impede the manufacture or shipment of products, or disrupt the processing of transactions.  For example, we have invested in information technology to upgrade the systems in both our LGM North America business and RBIS segment to drive business efficiency and supply chain productivity.  Processes affected by these implementations included, among other things, order management, pricing, shipping, purchasing, general accounting and planning.  We have implemented measures to mitigate our risk related to system and network disruptions, but if a disruption were to occur, we could incur significant losses and remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, we rely on services provided by third-party vendors for certain information technology processes, which makes our operations vulnerable to a failure by any one of these vendors to perform adequately or maintain effective internal controls.Security breaches could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which could cause our business and reputation to suffer. We maintain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form, which is stored in data centers and on our networks and third-party cloud services, including confidential and proprietary information as well as 11Table of Contentspersonal information regarding our customers and employees. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations. Data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering and theft. We develop and maintain systems to prevent this from occurring, but the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly sophisticated. Moreover, despite our efforts, the possibility of intrusion, tampering and theft cannot be eliminated entirely. Our information technology and infrastructure may become vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Additionally, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business objectives. While we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and, where appropriate, assess the protections employed by these third parties, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may be compromised. Any such breach or attack could compromise our network, the network of a third party to whom we have disclosed confidential, proprietary or personal information, a data center where we have stored such information or a third-party cloud service provider, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, impair our ability to conduct business, or result in the loss or diminished value of profitable opportunities and the loss of revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property. Contractual provisions with third parties, including cloud service providers, may limit our ability to recover these losses. If personal information of our customers or employees were to be misappropriated, our reputation with our customers and employees could be injured, resulting in loss of business or decline in morale, and we could incur costs to compensate our customers or employees or pay damages or fines as a result of litigation or regulatory actions arising out of any such incident. Data privacy legislation and regulation have been increasing in recent years – including, for example, the General Data Protection Regulation in the EU, the Cyber Security Law in China, the General Data Protection Law in Brazil and the state of California’s Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 – and although we have made reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to regulatory action in the event of an incident.Although we have experienced some security incidents that did not have a significant or material adverse effect on our business, this may not be the case in the future. We have taken many steps to further improve the security of our networks and computer systems, including conducting user education and phishing exercises to protect against social engineering and inadvertent or intentional disclosure of data; implementing multi-factor authentication and advanced malware detection measures; upgrading legacy information technology systems to simplify and standardize business processes and applications; continuously improving information technology project and portfolio management discipline, using metrics and reviews and implementing appropriate mitigation measures; establishing a data loss prevention framework to better identify and protect our critical data; conducting third party penetration testing to assess the effectiveness of our cybersecurity, network and site access controls; removing USB drive access across our company; and improving our capabilities based on threat intelligence and the publicized incidents experienced by other companies, as well as ones that we have experienced despite their minimal operational or financial impact to date. We regularly review the effectiveness of our cybersecurity preparedness program using an industry standard cybersecurity framework and best practices (e.g., ISO27000, NIST 800).  Despite these and other mitigation efforts, there can be no assurance that we have fully protected our information, that third parties to whom we have disclosed such information or with whom we have stored such information (in data centers and on the cloud) are taking similar precautions, or that we will not experience future hacking or intrusion attempts.For us to remain competitive, it is important to recruit and retain our key management and highly-skilled employees. We also utilize various outsourcing arrangements for certain services, and related delays, resource availability, or errors by these service providers may lead to increased costs or disruption in our business.There is significant competition to recruit and retain key management and highly-skilled employees.  In particular, due to expansion to additional geographies and our ongoing productivity efforts and recent employee restructuring actions, it may be difficult for us to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of highly-skilled employees. We may also be unable to recruit and retain key management and highly-skilled employees if we do not offer market-competitive employment and compensation terms. If we fail to recruit or retain our key management or 12Table of Contentssufficient numbers of highly-skilled employees, we could experience disruption in our businesses and difficulties managing our operations and implementing our business strategy.Executive succession planning is also important to our long-term success. We experienced several recent key management changes, including promotions of long-serving and experienced leaders to the positions of Chief Executive Officer in 2016 and Chief Financial Officer in 2017, as well as the departure of the Vice President/General Manager of our IHM segment in 2018. In addition, the President of our LGM segment ceased serving in that capacity at the end of 2019. While we believe we have appropriate leadership development programs and succession plans in place, any failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving our key management or other highly-skilled employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. In addition, we have outsourced certain services to third-party service providers, and may outsource other services in the future to achieve cost savings and operating efficiencies.  Service provider delays, resource availability, business issues or errors may disrupt our businesses and/or increase costs.  If we do not effectively develop, implement and manage outsourcing relationships, if third-party providers do not perform effectively or in a timely manner, or if we experience problems with transitioning work to a third party, we may not be able to achieve our expected cost savings, and may experience delays or incur additional costs to correct errors made by these service providers.  We have various non-U.S. collective labor arrangements, which make us subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our business.Work interruptions or stoppages could significantly impact the volume of products we have available for sale. In addition, collective bargaining agreements, union contracts and labor laws may impair our ability to reduce labor costs by closing or downsizing manufacturing facilities because of limitations on personnel and salary changes and similar restrictions. A work stoppage at one or more of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, if any of our customers were to experience a work stoppage, that customer may halt or limit purchases of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Similarly, if any of our suppliers were to experience a work stoppage, they could halt or limit supplies of products necessary for us to conduct our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our stock price may be volatile, which, among other things, could cause our tax rate to vary significantly. Changes in our stock price may affect our access to, or cost of financing from, capital markets and may affect our stock-based compensation arrangements, among other things. Our stock price, which increased significantly in 2019 after having experienced a decline in 2018, and may in the future experience substantial volatility, is influenced by changes in the overall stock market and demand for equity securities in general.  Other factors, including our financial performance on an absolute basis and relative to our peers and competitors, as well as market expectations of our performance, the level of perceived growth of our industries, and other company-specific factors, can also materially adversely affect our stock price.  There can be no assurance that our stock price will not be volatile in the future.  In any period in which our stock price is higher than the grant price of the stock-based compensation vesting or being exercised in that period, we are required to recognize excess tax benefits that would decrease our effective tax rate.  Conversely, if our stock price is lower than the grant price of the stock-based compensation vesting or being exercised in that period, we are required to recognize tax charges that would increase our effective tax rate.  This tax effect is dependent on our stock price and there can be no assurance that we will recognize similar levels of excess tax benefits in future years.We cannot guarantee that we will continue to repurchase shares of our common stock or pay dividends on our common stock or that repurchases will enhance long-term stockholder value. Changes in our levels of stock repurchases or dividends could affect our stock price and increase its volatility.In April 2019, our Board authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock with a fair market value of up to $650 million, in addition to the amount of shares that were available for repurchase under a previous authorization. As of December 28, 2019, shares of our common stock in the aggregate amount of $644.7 million remained authorized for repurchase under our outstanding Board authorization. Share repurchases under our 13Table of Contentsrepurchase program may be made through a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades or accelerated share repurchase transactions. Our share repurchase authorizations do not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares or to repurchase any specific number of shares for any fixed period.  The timing and amount of repurchases, if any, are subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. Our repurchase of common stock may be limited, suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and without prior notice.Additionally, any future dividends that may be declared and paid from time to time are subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. We are not obligated to continue a dividend for any fixed period, and the payment of dividends could be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and without prior notice. We will continue to retain future earnings to develop our business, as opportunities arise, and evaluate on a quarterly basis the amount and timing of future dividends based on our operating results, financial condition, capital requirements and general business conditions. The amount and timing of any future dividends may vary, and the payment of any dividend does not assure that we will pay dividends in the future.In addition, any future repurchases of our common stock or payment of dividends, or any determination to cease repurchasing stock or paying dividends, could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a share repurchase program and any future dividends could cause our stock price to be higher than it would otherwise be and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Additionally, any future repurchases of our common stock or payment of dividends could impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions. Although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance that it will do so because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce our program’s effectiveness.If our indebtedness increases significantly or our credit ratings are downgraded, we may have difficulty obtaining acceptable short- and long-term financing. At December 28, 2019, we had approximately $1.94 billion of debt.  Our overall level of indebtedness and credit ratings are significant factors in our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing.  Higher debt levels could negatively impact our ability to meet other business needs and could result in higher financing costs. The credit ratings assigned to us also impact the interest rates paid.  A downgrade of our short-term credit ratings could impact our ability to access the commercial paper markets and increase our borrowing costs.  If our access to commercial paper markets were to become limited and we were required to obtain short-term funding under our revolving credit facility or our other credit facilities, we would face increased exposure to variable interest rates.  An increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business.In 2019, our average variable-rate borrowings were approximately $325 million. Increases in short-term interest rates would directly impact the amount of interest we pay. Fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs and have a material adverse effect on our business.In response to the last global economic recession, extraordinary monetary policy actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banking institutions, including the utilization of quantitative easing, were taken to create and maintain a low interest rate environment. Over the past few years, the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised its benchmark interest rate, though more recently it lowered its benchmark interest rate, which, as of December 28, 2019 was between 1.5% and 1.75%. It is possible that increases in 2020 could occur, which may result in significantly higher long-term interest rates. Such a transition may, among other things, reduce the availability and/or increase the costs of obtaining new debt and refinancing existing indebtedness, and negatively impact our stock price.The alteration or discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) may adversely affect our borrowing costs.As of December 28, 2019, $171 million of our outstanding indebtedness bears interest at variable interest rates, none of which is based on LIBOR; however, our long-term credit facility is based on LIBOR. LIBOR may be subject 14Table of Contentsto regulatory guidance and/or reform that could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences. In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect that any discontinuance, modification or other reforms to LIBOR or any other reference rate, or the establishment of alternative reference rates, will have on our business. Although we do not believe the risk to be significant for us, if LIBOR ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating LIBOR change from their current form, our borrowing costs could be adversely affected. Our current and future debt covenants may limit our flexibility. Our credit facilities and the indentures governing our notes contain, and any of our future indebtedness likely would contain, restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us. Among other things, these covenants restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, incur certain liens on our assets, make certain investments, sell our assets or merge with third parties, and enter into certain transactions. We are also required to maintain specified financial ratios under certain conditions. These restrictive covenants and ratios in our existing debt agreements and any future financing agreements may limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain activities and transactions that may be in our long-term best interests and could place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors, which could materially adversely affect our business.Our pension assets are significant and subject to market, interest and credit risk that may reduce their value. Changes in the value of our pension assets could materially adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.  In particular, the value of our investments may decline due to increases in interest rates or volatility in the financial markets.  In addition, we may take actions to reduce the financial volatility associated with our pension liabilities, which could result in charges in the nearer term.  As such, we continuously evaluate options to better manage the volatility associated with our pension liabilities.  Although we mitigate these risks by investing in high quality securities, ensuring adequate diversification of our investment portfolio and monitoring our portfolio’s overall risk profile, the value of our investments may nevertheless decline.  In September 2018, we terminated our Avery Dennison Pension Plan (the “ADPP”), a U.S. pension plan, and completed the settlement of the ADPP obligations in 2019. This settlement in 2019 resulted in approximately $444 million of pretax charges in 2019, partially offset by related tax benefits of approximately $179 million.  See Note 6, “Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits,” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our 2019 Annual Report.The level of returns on our pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods. Changes in accounting standards and government regulations could also affect our pension and postretirement plan expense and funding requirements.We evaluate the assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our international pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans in consultation with outside actuaries.  In the event that we were to determine that changes were warranted in the assumptions used, such as the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, or mortality rates, our pension and projected postretirement benefit expenses and funding requirements could increase or decrease.  Because of changing market conditions or changes in the participant population, the actuarial assumptions that we use may differ from actual results, which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liability and related costs. Funding obligations for each plan are determined based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date as required under applicable government regulations.  Our pension funding requirements, and the timing of funding payments, could also be affected by future legislation or regulation. An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our results of operations and net worth.Goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators are present).  As of December 28, 2019, the carrying value of our goodwill was $930.8 million.  We review goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. In assessing fair value, we make estimates and assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates, and 15Table of Contentsdiscount rates based on our business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data.  There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management’s judgment in applying these factors.  Goodwill valuations have been calculated primarily using an income approach based on the present value of projected future cash flows of each reporting unit.  We could be required to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to our business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines.  These types of events could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future.  Impairment charges could substantially affect our business in the periods in which they are made. Unfavorable developments in legal proceedings, investigations and other legal, environmental, compliance and regulatory matters, could impact us in a materially adverse manner. There can be no assurance that any outcome of any litigation, investigation or other legal, environmental, compliance and regulatory matter will be favorable. Our financial results could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome to pending or future litigation and investigations, and other legal, environmental, compliance and regulatory matters.  See “Legal Proceedings” (Part I, Item 3). We are required to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various international jurisdictions, and our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.We are required to comply with the anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various international jurisdictions, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK’s Bribery Act of 2010. If we fail to comply with anti-corruption laws, we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties, including regulatory fines, monetary damages and incarceration for responsible employees and managers. In addition, if our distributors or agents fail to comply with these laws, our business may also be materially adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties.We are required to comply with environmental, health, and safety laws at our operations around the world. The costs of complying with these laws could materially adversely affect our business.We are subject to national, state, provincial and/or local environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad, including those related to the disposal of hazardous waste and the emission of greenhouse gases from our manufacturing processes.  These laws impose liability for the costs of, and damages resulting from, cleaning up current sites, past spills, disposals and other releases of hazardous substances.  These laws are often unclear and subject to the discretion of the enforcing authorities.  Compliance with existing and future environmental, health and safety laws could subject us to fees, penalties, costs or liabilities, impact our production capabilities, limit our ability to sell, expand or acquire facilities, and have a material adverse effect on our business.  Laws and regulations related to the environment, product content and product safety are complex, change often, and can be open to different interpretations.  In addition, we could be materially and adversely impacted by any environmental or product safety enforcement action affecting our suppliers, particularly in emerging markets.  We have accrued liabilities for the environmental clean-up of certain sites, including the eleven sites for which U.S. governmental agencies have designated us as a potentially responsible party as of our 2019 fiscal year-end, where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.  See “Legal Proceedings” (Part I, Item 3).  However, because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities, the actual expense to remediate currently identified sites and other sites that could be identified for cleanup in the future could be higher than the liabilities accrued. We are subject to governmental export and import control laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in these markets.Export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of some of our products to embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons. While we train our employees to comply with these regulations, use third party screening software, and take other measures, we cannot guarantee that a violation will not occur. A prohibited shipment could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties, fines, civil 16Table of Contentsand criminal sanctions and reputational harm. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could decrease our ability to export or sell our products internationally. Any limitation on our ability to export or sell our products could materially adversely affect our business.Some of our products are subject to export control laws and regulations and may be exported only with an export license or through an applicable export license exception. If we fail to comply with export licensing, customs regulations, economic sanctions or other laws, we could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including economic sanctions against us, incarceration for responsible employees and managers, and the possible loss of export or import privileges. In addition, if our distributors fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be materially adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties. Obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be time consuming and expensive and could result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities.Infringing intellectual property rights of third parties or inadequately acquiring or protecting our intellectual property could harm our ability to compete or grow. Because our products involve complex technology and chemistry, we are involved from time to time in litigation involving patents and other intellectual property.  Parties have filed, and in the future may file, claims against us alleging that we have infringed their intellectual property rights.  If we were held liable for infringement, we could be required to pay damages, obtain licenses or cease making or selling certain products.  There can be no assurance that licenses would be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The defense of these claims, whether or not meritorious, or the development of new technologies could cause us to incur significant costs and divert the attention of management.We also have valuable intellectual property upon which third parties may infringe.  We attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual property and proprietary information by relying on the patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws of the U.S. and other countries, as well as non-disclosure agreements. However, it may be possible for a third party to obtain our information without our authorization, independently develop similar technologies, or breach a non-disclosure agreement entered into with us.  In addition, many of the countries in which we operate do not have intellectual property laws that protect proprietary rights as fully as do laws in the U.S.  The use of our intellectual property by someone else without our authorization could reduce or eliminate certain competitive advantages we have, cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business.  Further, the costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights could materially adversely impact our business. We have obtained and applied for U.S. and foreign trademark registrations and patents, and will continue to evaluate whether to register additional trademarks and apply for additional patents.  We cannot guarantee that any of the pending applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities.  Further, we cannot assure that the validity of our patents or our trademarks will not be challenged.  In addition, third parties may be able to develop competing products using technology that avoids our patents.  We are subject to risks associated with the availability and coverage of various types of insurance.We have various types of insurance, including property, workers’ compensation, general and excess liability, and environmental liability. Insurance costs can be unpredictable and may materially adversely impact our business.  We retain some portion of our insurable risks, and therefore, unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits could have a material adverse effect on our business"

11,AVY,AVERY DENNISON CORP,2012-02-27,">Item 1A.RISK FACTORS.  Our ability to attain our goals and objectives is materially dependent on numerous factors and risks, including but not limited to, the following: The demand for our products is impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide conditions, which could have a material adverseeffect on our sales and profitability.  We conduct business in over 60 countries and our domestic andinternational operations are strongly influenced by matters beyond our control, including changes in political, social, economic and labor conditions, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), and international trade regulations(including tariffs), as well as the impact of these changes on the underlying demand for our products.  Changes in economicconditions in the regions in which we conduct business could negatively impact our customers, suppliers and business.  A decline in economic activity in the United States and other regions of the world can result in a material adverse effect on our business, including, among other things, reduced consumer spending,declines in asset valuations, diminished liquidity and credit availability, significant volatility in securities prices, rating downgrades, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The most recent declines in economic conditions in theUnited States, Europe, and Asia adversely affected our customers, suppliers and businesses similar to ours. These declines resulted in a variety of negative effects, including reduction in revenues, increased costs, lower gross margin percentages,increased allowances for doubtful accounts and/or write-offs of accounts receivable, and required recognition of impairments of capitalized assets, including goodwill and other intangibles. A decline in economic conditions, including the ongoingmacroeconomic challenges in the United States and Europe and the debt crisis in certain countries in the European Union, could also have other material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Weare not able to predict the duration and severity of adverse economic conditions in the U.S. and other countries, and there can be no assurance that there will not be further declines in economic activity.   5 Table of ContentsAs a manufacturer, our sales and profitability are dependent upon the cost andavailability of raw materials and energy, which are subject to price fluctuations, and our ability to control or pass on costs of raw materials and labor. Raw material cost increases could adversely affect our business, results of operations andfinancial condition.  The pricing environment for raw materials used in a number of our businessescontinues to be challenging and volatile. Additionally, energy costs remain volatile and unpredictable. Inflationary and other increases in the costs of raw materials, labor and energy have occurred in the past, recurred in 2010 and 2011, and areexpected to recur. Our performance depends in part on our ability to pass on these cost increases to customers by raising the selling prices for our products and by effecting productivity improvements. Depending on market dynamics and the terms ofcustomer contracts, our ability to recover these costs through increased pricing may be limited. Also, it is important for us to obtain timely delivery of materials, equipment, and other resources from suppliers, and to make timely delivery tocustomers. It is possible that any of our supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural and other disasters or other events, or be terminated in the future. A disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our sales andprofitability, and any sustained interruption in our receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our future profitability may be adversely affected if we generate less productivity improvement than projected. We intend to continue efforts to reduce costs in many of our operations through facility closures and square footagereductions, headcount reductions, organizational restructuring, process standardization, and manufacturing relocation, by using a variety of tools, including Enterprise Lean Sigma and Kaizen events, to increase productivity. However, the success ofthese efforts is not assured and lower levels of productivity could reduce profitability. In addition, cost reduction actions could expose us to additional production risk and loss of sales. We are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences. If we do not compete effectively, we could lose market share andexperience falling prices, adversely affecting our financial results.  We are at risk that our competitorswill expand in our key market segments and implement new technologies making them more competitive. Competitors also may be able to offer additional products, services, lower prices, or other incentives that we cannot or will not offer or that willmake our products less profitable. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.  We also are at risk with regard to changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases, which may be affected byannounced price changes, changes in our incentive programs, or changes in the customers ability to achieve incentive goals. Changes in customers preferences for our products can also affect the demand for our products. Our business couldbe negatively impacted by a decline in demand for our products.  Foreign currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in thoserates, may affect our reported sales and profitability.  In 2011, approximately 73% of our sales were frominternational operations. Fluctuations in currencies can cause transaction, translation and other losses to us, which could negatively impact our sales and profitability. Margins on sales of our products in foreign countries could be materially andadversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.  We monitor our foreign currency exposuresand may from time to time, use hedging instruments to mitigate exposure to changes in foreign currencies. Hedging activities may only offset a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over thelimited time the hedges are in place.  Additionally, there are ongoing concerns regarding the short- andlong-term stability of the euro and its ability to serve as a single currency for a variety of individual countries. These concerns could lead individual countries to revert, or threaten to revert, to their former local currencies, which could leadto the dislocation or dissolution of the euro. If this were to occur, the assets we hold in a country that re-introduces its local currency   6 Table of Contentscould be significantly devalued. Furthermore, the dislocation or dissolution of the euro could cause significant volatility and disruption in the global economy, which could adversely impact ourfinancial results, including the availability and cost of supplies and materials, the demand and pricing strategy for our products given the introduction of additional currencies, and our ability to obtain financing at reasonable costs. Finally, ifit were to become necessary for us to conduct business in additional currencies, we could be subject to additional earnings volatility as amounts in these currencies are translated into U.S. dollars. We have acquired companies and may continue to acquire other companies. Acquisitions come with significant risks and uncertainties,including those related to integration, technology and personnel. In addition, divestures of any of our businesses or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. To grow our product lines and expand into new markets, we have made acquisitions, including our acquisitions of PaxarCorporation in June 2007 and DM Label Group in April 2008, and may do so in the future. Various risks, uncertainties, and costs are associated with acquisitions. Effective integration of systems, controls, objectives, personnel, product lines,market segments, customers, suppliers, and production facilities and cost savings can be difficult to achieve, and the results of integration actions are uncertain, particularly given our geographically dispersed organization. In addition, we maynot be able to retain key personnel of an acquired company and we may not be able to successfully execute integration strategies or achieve projected performance targets for the business segment into which an acquired company is integrated. Bothbefore and after the closing of an acquisition, our business and those of the acquired company or companies may suffer due to uncertainty or diversion of management attention. There can be no assurance that any acquisitions will be successful andcontribute to our profitability and we may not be able to identify new acquisition opportunities in the future. We continually evaluate the performance of our businesses and may determine to sell a business or product line. Divesturesmay result in significant write-offs or impairments of assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets. Divestitures may involve additional risks, including separation of operations, products and personnel, diversion of management attention,disruption to our other businesses and loss of key employees. On December 30, 2011, we agreed to sell our Office and Consumer Products business to 3M Company. We may be unable to close the transaction in a timely manner, or at all, because ofdelays in carving-out the Office and Consumer Products business or failure to obtain regulatory approvals or satisfy other closing requirements, any of which could result in substantial additional costs or could unfavorably affect the ultimate valueof the sale. In addition, we may be unable to realize any accounting or tax benefits from the transaction, which could unfavorably affect the ultimate value of the sale. The divestiture and provision of transition services may also disrupt ourongoing business, distract management, divert resources and create challenges in maintaining our current customer service levels, business standards, controls and procedures. We may not successfully manage these or other risks we may confront indivesting a business or product line, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Our customer base is diversified, but in certain portions of our business, industry concentration has increased the importance, and decreased the number, of significant customers. Sales of our Office and Consumer Products business in the United States are concentrated in a few major customers,principally office product superstores, mass market distributors and wholesalers. The business risk associated with this concentration, including increased credit risks for these and other customers, and the possibility of related bad debtwrite-offs, could negatively affect our margins and profits.  Possible increased difficulty in the collection ofreceivables as a result of economic conditions or other market factors could have a material effect on our results from operations and cash provided by operating activities. Although we have processes to administer credit granted to customers and believe our allowance for doubtful accounts isadequate, we have experienced, and in the future may experience, losses as a result of our inability to collect our accounts receivable. The financial difficulties of a customer could result in reduced business with that customer. We may also assumehigher credit risk relating to receivables of a customer   7 Table of Contentsexperiencing financial difficulty. If these developments occur, our inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on our trade accounts receivable from major customers couldsubstantially reduce our income and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows from operating activities.  Our inability to develop and successfully market new products and applications could compromise our competitive position. The timely introduction of new products and improvements in current products helps determine our success. Research anddevelopment for each of our operating segments is complex and uncertain and requires innovation and anticipation of market trends. We could focus on products that ultimately are not accepted by customers or we could suffer delays in production orlaunch of new products that could compromise our competitive position.  We are subject to risks associated with theavailability and coverage of various types of insurance.  We have various types of insurance, includingproperty, workers compensation and general liability. Insurance costs can be unpredictable and may adversely impact our financial results. We retain some portion of our insurable risks, and therefore, unforeseen or catastrophic losses inexcess of insured limits could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.  Changes in our tax rates couldaffect our future results.  Our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix ofearnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, expirations of tax holidays, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation. We are subject to the regularexamination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance that theoutcomes from these examinations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. The amount of various taxes we pay is subject to ongoing compliance requirements and audits by federal, state and foreign taxauthorities.  Our estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues is subject to our assessment ofrelevant risks, facts, and circumstances existing at that time. We use these assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and other tax-related accounts. Our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustmentsto our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved, which may materially impact our effective tax rate and/or our financial results.  We have deferred tax assets that we may not be able to use under certain circumstances.  If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions, or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences becometaxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and would have a material adverse effect on our future operating results. Inaddition, changes in statutory tax rates may change our deferred tax asset or liability balances, with either favorable or unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate. The computation and assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets mayalso be materially impacted by new legislation or regulations.  Proposed changes in U.S. tax legislation could materiallyimpact our financial results.  Currently, the majority of our revenue is generated from customers locatedoutside of the U.S., and a substantial portion of our assets and our employees are located outside of the U.S. We have not accrued income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings for most non-U.S. subsidiaries, because those  8 Table of Contentsearnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. Certain proposals could substantially increase our tax expense, which would substantially reduce ourincome and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows from operating activities.  For us toremain competitive, it is important to recruit and retain highly-skilled employees. We also utilize various outsourcing arrangements for certain services, and related delays, resource availability, or errors may lead to increased costs or disruptionin our business.  There is significant competition to recruit and retain skilled employees. Due toexpansion in certain markets and our ongoing productivity efforts and recent employee reductions, it may be difficult for us to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of highly-skilled employees. We have outsourced certain services to third-party service providers, and may outsource other services in the future toachieve cost savings and efficiencies. Service provider delays, resource availability, business issues or errors may lead to disruption in our businesses and/or increased costs. If we do not effectively develop, implement and manage outsourcingstrategies, if third-party providers do not perform effectively and in a timely manner, or if we experience problems with a transition, we may not be able to achieve our expected cost savings, and may experience delays or incur additional costs tocorrect errors made by these service providers.  Significant disruption to our information technology infrastructure couldadversely impact our operations, sales, customer relations, and financial results.  We rely on theefficient and uninterrupted operation of a large and complex information technology infrastructure to link our worldwide divisions. Like other information technology systems, ours is susceptible to a number of factors including, but not limited to,damage or interruptions resulting from a variety of causes such as obsolescence, natural disasters, power failures, human error, viruses and data security breaches. We upgrade and install new systems, which, if installed or programmed incorrectly oron a delayed timeframe, could cause delays or cancellations of customer orders, impede the manufacture or shipment of products, or disrupt the processing of transactions. We have implemented certain measures to reduce our risk related to system andnetwork disruptions, but if a disruption were to occur, we could incur significant losses and remediation costs. We maintain information necessary to conduct our business, including confidential and proprietary information as well aspersonal information regarding our customers and employees, in digital form. Data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering and theft. We develop and maintain systems to prevent this from occurring, but thedevelopment and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Moreover, despite our efforts, the possibility ofintrusion, tampering and theft cannot be eliminated entirely, and risks associated with each of these remain. In addition, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue businessobjectives. While we obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information and, where appropriate, assess the protections employed by these third parties, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by third parties may becompromised. If our data systems are compromised, our ability to conduct business may be impaired, we may lose profitable opportunities or the value of those opportunities may be diminished and we may lose revenue as a result of unlicensed use ofour intellectual property. If personal information of our customers or employees were misappropriated, our reputation with our customers and employees could be injured resulting in loss of business or morale, and we could incur costs to remediatepossible injury to our customers and employees or to pay fines or take other action with respect to judicial or regulatory actions arising out of any such incident. Additionally, we rely on services provided by third-party vendors for a significant portion of our information technologysupport, development and implementation, which may make our operations vulnerable to these third parties failure to perform adequately.   9 Table of ContentsMiscalculation of our infrastructure needs could adversely impact our financial results. Projected requirements of our infrastructure investments may differ from actual levels if our volumegrowth is not as we anticipate. Our infrastructure investments generally are long term in nature, and it is possible that these investments may not generate our expected return due to changes in the marketplace, failures to complete implementation,or other factors. Significant changes from our expected need for and/or returns on infrastructure investments could adversely affect our financial results.  Our reputation, sales, and earnings could be affected adversely if the quality of our products and services does not meet customer expectations. There are occasions when we manufacture products with quality issues resulting from defective materials, manufacturing,packaging or design. Many of these issues are discovered before shipping, thus causing delays in shipping, delays in the manufacturing process, and occasionally cancelled orders. When issues are discovered after shipment, they may result inadditional shipping costs, discounts, refunds, and loss of future sales. Both pre-shipping and post-shipping quality issues can result in adverse financial consequences and a negative impact on our reputation. Because our products are sold by third parties, our financial results depend in part on the financial health of these parties. Our products are not sold only by us, but by third-party distributors and retailers as well. Some of ourdistributors also market products that compete with our products. Changes in the financial or business conditions or the purchasing decisions of these third parties or their customers could affect our sales and profitability. We outsource some of our manufacturing. If there are significant changes in the quality control or financial or business condition ofthese outsourced manufacturers, our business could be negatively impacted.  We manufacture most of ourproducts, but we also use third-party manufacturers, for example, for specialty jobs or capacity overflow. Outsourced manufacturers reduce our ability to prevent product quality issues, late deliveries, customer dissatisfaction and compliance withcustomer requirements for labor standards. Because of possible quality issues and customer dissatisfaction, deficiencies in the performance of outsourced manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results. Changes in our business strategies may increase our costs and could affect the profitability of our businesses. As changes in our business environment occur, we may need to adjust our business strategies or restructureour operations or particular businesses. When these changes occur, we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down the value of selected assets. We also may need to invest in new businesses that have short-term returnsthat are negative or low and whose ultimate business prospects are uncertain. In any of these events, our costs may increase, our assets may be impaired, or our returns on new investments may be lower than prior to the change in strategy. If our indebtedness increases significantly or our credit ratings are downgraded, we may have difficulty obtainingacceptable short- and long-term financing.  Our overall level of indebtedness and credit ratings aresignificant factors in our ability to raise short-term and long-term financing. Higher debt levels could negatively impact our ability to meet other business needs or opportunities and could result in higher financing costs. The credit ratingsassigned to us also impact the interest rates on our commercial paper and other borrowings. If our credit ratings are downgraded, our financial flexibility could decrease and the cost to borrow would increase. At December 31, 2011, our variablerate borrowings were $225.6 million. Fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs and have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.   10 Table of ContentsThe level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarialassumptions used for valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods. Changes in accounting standards and government regulations could also affect our pension and postretirement plan expense and funding requirements. Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for ourpension plan and other postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by us in consultation with outside actuaries. In the event that we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used, such as the discount rate, expected long-term rate ofreturn, or health care costs, our future pension and projected postretirement benefit expenses and funding requirements could increase or decrease. Because of changing market conditions or changes in the participant population, the actuarialassumptions that we use may differ from actual results, which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liability and related costs. Funding obligations are determined based on the value of assets and liabilities on aspecific date as required under relevant government regulations for each plan. Future pension funding requirements, and the timing of funding payments, could be affected by future legislation or regulation. The level of our pension assets is significant and subject to market, interest and credit risk that may reduce its value. Changes in the value of our pension assets could materially adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.In particular, the value of our investments may decline due to increases in interest rates or volatility in the financial markets. Although we mitigate these risks by investing in high quality securities, ensuring adequate diversification of ourinvestment portfolio and monitoring our portfolio's overall risk profile, the value of our investments may nevertheless decline.  Our share price may be volatile.  Changes in our stockprice may affect our access to, or cost of financing from, capital markets and may affect our stock-based compensation arrangements, among other things. Our stock price, which has at times experienced substantial volatility, is influenced by changesin the overall stock market and demand for equity securities in general. Other factors, including our financial performance, on a standalone basis and relative to our peers and competitors, and market expectations for our future performance, thelevel of perceived growth of our industries, and other company-specific factors, can also materially impact our share price. There can be no assurance that our stock price will be less volatile in the future. An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth. Goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment at leastannually (or more frequently, if impairment indicators are present). In assessing the carrying value of goodwill, we make estimates and assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates, and discount rates based on our business plans,economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying these factors. Goodwill valuations have been calculated using an incomeapproach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. We could be required to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significantdeclines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines. These types of events and the resulting analyses resulted in a significant goodwill impairment charge in 2009 relatedto our Retail Branding and Information Solutions segment and could result in other goodwill impairment charges in the future. Impairment charges could substantially affect our financial results in the periods of such charges, as did the one in 2009.  11 Table of ContentsPotential adverse developments in legal proceedings, investigations and other legal,compliance and regulatory matters, including those involving product and trade compliance, anti-bribery and other matters, could impact us materially.  Our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted by an unfavorable outcome to pending or future litigation and investigations, and other legal, compliance and regulatory matters,including, but not limited to, product and trade compliance and anti-bribery matters. See Legal Proceedings (Part I, Item 3). There can be no assurance that any investigation or litigation outcome will be favorable. Infringing intellectual property rights of third parties or inadequately acquiring or protecting our intellectual property could harmour ability to compete or grow.  Because our products involve complex technology and chemistry, we areinvolved from time to time in litigation involving patents and other intellectual property. Parties have filed, and in the future may file, claims against us alleging that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. If we are held liablefor infringement, we could be required to pay damages, obtain licenses or cease making or selling certain products. There can be no assurance that licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms or will be available at all. The defenseof these claims, whether or not meritorious, and the development of new technology could cause us to incur significant costs and divert the attention of management. We also have valuable intellectual property upon which third parties may infringe. We attempt to protect and restrictaccess to our intellectual property and proprietary information by relying on the patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws of the U.S. and other countries, as well as non-disclosure agreements. However, it may be possible for a third partyto obtain our information without our authorization, independently develop similar technologies, or breach a non-disclosure agreement entered into with us. In addition, many of the countries in which we operate do not have intellectual property lawsthat protect proprietary rights as fully as in the U.S. The use of our intellectual property by someone else without our authorization could reduce or eliminate certain competitive advantages we have, cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm ourbusiness. Further, the costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our profitability.  We have obtained and applied for U.S. and foreign trademark registrations and patents, and will continue to evaluate whether to register additional trademarks and seek patents as appropriate. We cannotguarantee that any of the pending applications will be approved by the applicable government authorities. Further, we cannot assure that the validity of our patents or our trademarks will not be challenged. In addition, third parties may be able todevelop competing products using technology that avoids our patents.  We need to comply with numerous environmental,health, and safety laws. The costs of complying with these laws could adversely impact our financial results.  Due to the nature of our business, we are subject to environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including those related to the disposal of hazardous waste from our manufacturing processes.Compliance with existing and future environmental, health and safety laws could subject us to future costs or liabilities; impact our production capabilities; constrict our ability to sell, expand or acquire facilities; and generally impact ourfinancial performance. We have accrued liabilities for environmental clean-up sites, including sites for which governmental agencies have designated us as a potentially responsible party, where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and thecost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. See Legal Proceedings (Part I, Item 3). However, because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities, future expense to remediatecurrently identified sites and other sites, which could be identified in the future for cleanup, could be higher than the liabilities accrued.  Healthcare reform legislation could have a material adverse impact on our business.  During 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 were signed into law in the United States. Certain of the provisions that couldmost   12 Table of Contentssignificantly increase our healthcare costs in the near term include the removal of annual plan limits, the changes in rules regarding eligibility for dependents and the mandate that health planscover 100% of preventative care. In addition, our healthcare costs could increase if the new legislation and accompanying regulations require us to cover more employees than we do currently or pay penalty amounts in the event that employees do notelect our offered coverage. While much of the cost of the recent healthcare legislation enacted is expected to occur in or after 2014 due to provisions of the legislation being phased in over time, changes to our healthcare cost structure could havea material adverse impact on our business and operating costs.  The risks described above are not exhaustive.If any of the above risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition could suffer, which might cause the value of our securities to decline.  "
13,AVY,AVERY DENNISON CORP,2011-02-28,">Item 1A.      RISK    FACTORS.     Our ability to attain our goals and objectives is materially    dependent on numerous factors and risks, including but not    limited to, the following: As a    manufacturer, our sales and profitability are dependent upon the    cost and availability of raw materials and energy, which are    subject to price fluctuations, and our ability to control or    pass on costs of raw materials and labor. Raw material cost    increases could adversely affect our business, results of    operations and financial condition.     The pricing environment for raw materials used in a number of    our businesses continues to be challenging and volatile.    Additionally, energy costs remain volatile and unpredictable.    Inflationary and other increases in the costs of raw materials,    labor and energy have occurred in the past, recurred in 2010 and    thus far in 2011, and are expected    5     to recur. Our performance depends in part on our ability to pass    on these cost increases to customers through our selling prices    for products and to effect productivity improvements. Depending    on market dynamics and the terms of customer contracts, our    ability to recover these costs through increased pricing may be    limited. Also, it is important for us to obtain timely delivery    of materials, equipment, and other resources from suppliers, and    to make timely delivery to customers. It is possible that any of    our supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural    and other disasters or other events, or be terminated in the    future. A disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect    our sales and profitability, and any sustained interruption in    our receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse    effect on our business, results of operations and financial    condition. We are    affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences. If    we do not compete effectively, we could lose market share and    experience falling prices, adversely affecting our financial    results.     We are at risk that our competitors will expand in our key    market segments and implement new technologies making them more    competitive. Competitors also may be able to offer additional    products, services, lower prices, or other incentives that we    cannot or will not offer or that will make our products less    profitable. There can be no assurance that we will be able to    compete successfully against current and future competitors.     We also are at risk with regard to changes in customer order    patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained    by customers and the timing of customer purchases, which may be    affected by announced price changes, changes in our incentive    programs, or changes in the customers ability to achieve    incentive goals. Changes in customers preferences for our    products can also affect the demand for our products. Our    business could be negatively impacted by a decline in demand for    our products. The    demand for our products is impacted by the effects of, and    changes in, worldwide conditions, which could have an adverse    effect on our sales and profitability.     We conduct business in over 60 countries and our domestic and    international operations are strongly influenced by matters    beyond our control, including changes in political, social,    economic and labor conditions, tax laws (including    U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), and international    trade regulations (including tariffs), as well as the impact of    these changes on the underlying demand for our products. Changes    in tax legislation throughout the world could materially impact    our results.     Our future effective tax rate and related tax balance sheet    attributes could be impacted by changes in tax legislation    throughout the world. In particular, proposed U.S. tax    legislation could materially impact our results. Currently, the    majority of our revenue is generated from customers located    outside of the U.S., and a substantial portion of our assets and    employees are located outside of the U.S. We have not    accrued income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on    undistributed earnings for most    non-U.S. subsidiaries,    because those earnings are intended to be indefinitely    reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. Certain    proposals could substantially increase our tax expense, which    would substantially reduce our income and have a material    adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows from    operating activities. Changes    in economic conditions in the regions in which we conduct    business could negatively impact our customers, suppliers and    business.     A decline in economic activity in the United States and other    regions of the world can result in adverse effects on our    business, including, among other things, reduced consumer    spending, inflation, declines in asset valuations, diminished    liquidity and credit availability, significant volatility in    securities prices, rating downgrades, and fluctuations in    foreign currency exchange rates. The most recent declines in    economic conditions were experienced in the United States,    Europe, and Asia and adversely affected our customers, suppliers    and businesses similar to ours and resulted in a variety of    negative effects, such as reduction in revenues, increased    costs, lower gross margin percentages, increased allowances for    doubtful accounts    and/or    write-offs of accounts receivable, and required recognition of    impairments of capitalized assets, including goodwill and other    intangibles. A decline in economic conditions could also have    other material adverse effects on our business, results of    operations, financial condition    6     and cash flows. We are not able to predict the duration and    severity of adverse economic conditions in the U.S. and    other countries, and there can be no assurance that there will    not be further declines in economic activity. Foreign    currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in those rates, may    affect our reported sales and profitability.     In 2010, approximately 68% of our sales were from international    operations. Fluctuations in currencies can cause transaction,    translation and other losses to us, which could negatively    impact our sales and profitability. Margins on sales of our    products in foreign countries could be materially and adversely    affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.     We monitor our foreign currency exposures and may, from time to    time, use hedging instruments to mitigate exposure to changes in    foreign currencies. Hedging activities may only offset a portion    of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in    foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in    place. Our    future profitability may be adversely affected if we generate    less productivity improvement than projected.     We intend to continue efforts to reduce costs in many of our    operations through facility closures, headcount reductions,    organizational restructuring, process standardization, and    manufacturing relocation, by using a variety of tools, such as    Lean Sigma and Kaizen events, to increase productivity. However,    the success of these efforts is not assured and lower levels of    productivity could reduce profitability. In addition, cost    reduction actions could expose us to additional production risk    and loss of sales. We have    acquired companies and may continue to acquire other companies.    Acquisitions come with significant risks and uncertainties,    including those related to integration, technology and    personnel. In addition, divestures of any of our businesses or    product lines could have a material adverse effect on our    business, results of operations and financial    condition.     To grow our product lines and expand into new markets, we have    made acquisitions, including our acquisitions of Paxar    Corporation in June 2007 and DM Label Group in April 2008, and    may do so in the future. Various risks, uncertainties, and costs    are associated with the acquisitions. Effective integration of    systems, controls, objectives, personnel, product lines, market    segments, customers, suppliers, and production facilities and    cost savings can be difficult to achieve, and the results of    integration actions are uncertain, particularly given our    geographically dispersed organization. In addition, we may not    be able to retain key personnel of an acquired company and we    may not be able to successfully execute integration strategies    or achieve projected performance targets for the business    segment into which an acquired company is integrated. Both    before and after the closing of an acquisition, our business and    those of the acquired company or companies may suffer due to    uncertainty or diversion of management attention. There can be    no assurance that any acquisitions will be successful and    contribute to our profitability and we may not be able to    identify new acquisition opportunities in the future.     We continually evaluate the performance of our businesses and    may determine to sell a business or product line. Divestures may    result in significant write-offs or impairments of assets,    including goodwill and other intangible assets. Divestitures may    involve additional risks, including separation of operations,    products and personnel, diversion of management attention,    disruption to our other businesses and loss of key employees. We    may not successfully manage these or other risks we may confront    in divesting a business or product line, which could have a    material adverse effect on our business, results of operations    and financial condition. Our    customer base is diversified, but in certain portions of our    business, industry concentration has increased the importance,    and decreased the number, of significant customers.     Sales of our office and consumer products in the United States    are concentrated in a few major customers, principally office    product superstores, mass market distributors and wholesalers.    The business risk associated with this concentration, including    increased credit risks for these and other customers, and the    possibility of related bad debt write-offs, could negatively    affect our margins and profits.    7 Possible    increased difficulty in the collection of receivables as a    result of economic conditions or other market factors could have    a material effect on our results from operations and anticipated    cash from operating activities.     Although we have processes to administer credit granted to    customers and believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is    adequate, we have experienced, and in the future may experience,    losses as a result of our inability to collect our accounts    receivable. The financial difficulties of a customer could    result in reduced business with that customer. We may also    assume higher credit risk relating to receivables of a customer    experiencing financial difficulty. If these developments occur,    our inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on    our trade accounts receivable from major customers could    substantially reduce our income and have a material adverse    effect on our results of operations and cash flows from    operating activities. Our    inability to develop and successfully market new products and    applications could compromise our competitive    position.     The timely introduction of new products and improvements in    current products helps determine our success. Research and    development for each of our operating segments is complex and    uncertain and requires innovation and anticipation of market    trends. We could focus on products that ultimately are not    accepted by customers or we could suffer delays in production or    launch of new products that could compromise our competitive    position. For us to    remain competitive, it is important to recruit and retain    highly-skilled employees. We also utilize various outsourcing    arrangements for certain services, and related delays, resource    availability, or errors may lead to increased costs or    disruption in our business.     There is significant competition to recruit and retain skilled    employees. Due to expansion in certain markets and the ongoing    productivity efforts and recent employee reductions, it may be    difficult for us to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of    highly-skilled employees.     We have outsourced certain services to third-party service    providers, and may outsource other services in the future to    achieve cost savings and efficiencies. Service provider delays,    resource availability, business issues or errors may lead to    disruption in our businesses    and/or    increased costs. If we do not effectively develop, implement and    manage outsourcing strategies, if third-party providers do not    perform effectively and in a timely manner, or if we experience    problems with a transition, we may not be able to achieve our    expected cost savings, and may have to experience delays or    incur additional costs to correct errors made by these service    providers. Significant    disruption to our information technology infrastructure could    adversely impact our operations, sales, customer relations, and    financial results.     We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a large    and complex information technology infrastructure to link our    worldwide divisions. Like other information technology systems,    ours is susceptible to a number of factors including, but not    limited to, damage or interruptions resulting from a variety of    causes such as obsolescence, natural disasters, power failures,    human error, viruses and data security breaches. We upgrade and    install new systems, which, if installed or programmed    incorrectly or on a delayed timeframe, could cause delays or    cancellations of customer orders, impede the manufacture or    shipment of products, or disrupt the processing of transactions.    We have implemented certain measures to reduce our risk related    to system and network disruptions, but if a disruption occurs,    we could incur significant losses and remediation costs.     Additionally, we rely on services provided by third-party    vendors for a significant portion of our information technology    support, development and implementation, which may make our    operations vulnerable to these third parties failure to    perform adequately. Miscalculation    of our infrastructure needs could adversely impact our financial    results.     Projected requirements of our infrastructure investments may    differ from actual levels if our volume growth is not as we    anticipate. Our infrastructure investments generally are long    term in nature, and it is possible that these investments may    not generate our expected return due to changes in the    marketplace, failures to complete    8     implementation, or other factors. Significant changes from our    expected need for    and/or    returns on infrastructure investments could adversely affect our    financial results. Our    reputation, sales, and earnings could be affected adversely if    the quality of our products and services does not meet customer    expectations.     There are occasions when we manufacture products with quality    issues resulting from defective materials, manufacturing,    packaging or design. Many of these issues are discovered before    shipping, thus causing delays in shipping, delays in the    manufacturing process, and occasionally cancelled orders. When    issues are discovered after shipment, it can result in    additional shipping costs, discounts, refunds, and loss of    future sales. Both pre-shipping and post-shipping quality issues    can result in adverse financial consequences and a negative    impact on our reputation. Some of    our products are sold by third parties.     Our products are not sold only by us, but by third-party    distributors and retailers as well. Some of our distributors    also market products that compete with our products. Changes in    the financial or business conditions or the purchasing decisions    of these third parties or their customers could affect our sales    and profitability. We    outsource some of our manufacturing. If there are significant    changes in the quality control or financial or business    condition of these outsourced manufacturers, our business could    be negatively impacted.     We manufacture most of our products, but we also use third-party    manufacturers, for example, for specialty jobs or capacity    overflow. Outsourced manufacturers reduce our ability to prevent    product quality issues, late deliveries, customer    dissatisfaction and compliance with customer requirements for    labor standards. Because of possible quality issues and customer    dissatisfaction, deficiencies in the performance of outsourced    manufacturers could have an adverse effect on our business or    financial results. Changes    in our business strategies may increase our costs and could    affect the profitability of our businesses.     As changes in our business environment occur, we may need to    adjust our business strategies to meet these changes or we may    find it otherwise necessary to restructure our operations or    particular businesses. When these changes occur, we may incur    costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down    the value of selected assets. We also may need to invest in new    businesses that have short-term returns that are negative or low    and whose ultimate business prospects are uncertain. In any of    these events, our costs may increase, our assets may be    impaired, or our returns on new investments may be lower than    prior to the change in strategy. If our    indebtedness increases significantly or our credit ratings are    downgraded, we may have difficulty obtaining acceptable short-    and long-term financing from the capital markets.     The overall level of indebtedness and our credit ratings are    significant factors in our ability to raise short-term and    long-term financing. Higher debt levels could negatively impact    our ability to meet other business needs or opportunities and    could result in higher financing costs. The credit ratings    assigned to us also impact the interest rates on our commercial    paper and other borrowings. If our credit ratings are    downgraded, our financial flexibility could decrease and the    cost to borrow would increase. At January 1, 2011, our    variable rate borrowings were approximately $380 million.    Fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs and    have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations    and financial condition. The level    of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the    actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect    our earnings and cash flows in future periods. Changes in    accounting standards and government regulations could also    affect our pension and postretirement plan expense and funding    requirements.     Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations    and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and other    postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by us in consultation    with outside actuaries. In the event that we determine that    changes are warranted in the assumptions used, such as the    discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, or health care    costs, our future pension and projected postretirement benefit    expenses and funding    9     requirements could increase or decrease. Because of changing    market conditions or changes in the participant population, the    actuarial assumptions that we use may differ from actual    results, which could have a significant impact on our pension    and postretirement liability and related costs. Funding    obligations are determined based on the value of assets and    liabilities on a specific date as required under relevant    government regulations for each plan. Future pension funding    requirements, and the timing of funding payments, could be    affected by legislation enacted by the relevant governmental    authorities. Our share    price may be volatile.     Changes in our stock price may affect our access to, or cost of    financing from, capital markets and may affect our stock-based    compensation arrangements, among other things. Our stock price,    which has at times experienced substantial volatility, is    influenced by changes in the overall stock market and demand for    equity securities in general. Other factors, including our    financial performance, on a standalone basis and relative to our    peers and competitors, and market expectations for our future    performance, the level of perceived growth of our industries,    and other company-specific events, can also impact our share    price. There can be no assurance that our stock price will be    less volatile in the future. An    impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively    impact our consolidated results of operations and net    worth.     Goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is not    amortized, but is reviewed for impairment at least annually (or    more frequently, if impairment indicators are present). In    assessing the carrying value of goodwill, we make estimates and    assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates, and    discount rates based on our business plans, economic    projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data.    There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and    managements judgment in applying these factors. Goodwill    valuations have been calculated using an income approach based    on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting    unit. We could be required to evaluate the carrying value of    goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience    disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in    operating results, divestiture of a significant component of our    business or sustained market capitalization declines. These    types of events and the resulting analyses resulted in a    significant goodwill impairment charge in 2009 related to our    Retail Information Services segment and could result in other    goodwill impairment charges in the future. Impairment charges    could substantially affect our financial results in the periods    of such charges, as did the one in 2009. Potential    adverse developments in legal proceedings, investigations and    other legal, compliance and regulatory matters, including those    involving product and trade compliance, Foreign Corrupt    Practices Act issues and other matters, could impact us    materially.     Our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted    by an unfavorable outcome to pending or future litigation and    investigations, including but not limited to, proceedings or    lawsuits related to class actions seeking treble damages for    alleged unlawful competitive practices, and other legal,    compliance and regulatory matters, including, but not limited    to, product, customs and trade compliance matters. See    Legal Proceedings (Part I, Item 3). There    can be no assurance that any investigation or litigation outcome    will be favorable. Infringing    intellectual property rights of third parties or inadequately    acquiring or protecting our intellectual property could harm our    ability to compete or grow.     Because our products involve complex technology and chemistry,    we are involved, from time to time, in litigation involving    patents and other intellectual property. Parties have filed, and    in the future may file, claims against us alleging that we have    infringed their intellectual property rights. If we are held    liable for infringement, we could be required to pay damages,    obtain licenses or cease making or selling certain products.    There can be no assurance that licenses will be available on    commercially reasonable terms or will be available at all. The    defense of these claims, whether or not meritorious, and the    development of new technology could cause us to incur    significant costs and divert the attention of management.    10     We also have valuable intellectual property upon which third    parties may infringe. We attempt to protect and restrict access    to our intellectual property and proprietary information by    relying on the patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret    laws of the U.S. and other countries, as well as    non-disclosure agreements. However, it may be possible for a    third party to obtain our information without our authorization,    independently develop similar technologies, or breach a    non-disclosure agreement entered into with us. In addition, many    of the countries in which we operate do not have intellectual    property laws that protect proprietary rights as fully as in the    U.S. The use of our intellectual property by someone else    without our authorization could reduce or eliminate certain    competitive advantages we have, cause us to lose sales or    otherwise harm our business. Further, the costs associated with    protecting our intellectual property rights could adversely    impact our profitability.     We have obtained and applied for some U.S. and foreign    trademark registrations and patents, and will continue to    evaluate whether to register additional trademarks and seek    patents as appropriate. We cannot guarantee that any of the    pending applications will be approved by the applicable    government authorities. Further, we cannot assure that the    validity of our patents or our trademarks will not be    challenged. In addition, third parties may be able to develop    competing products using technology that avoids our patents. We need    to comply with numerous environmental, health, and safety    laws.     Due to the nature of our business, we are subject to    environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations,    including those related to the disposal of hazardous waste from    our manufacturing processes. Compliance with existing and future    environmental, health and safety laws could subject us to future    costs or liabilities; impact our production capabilities;    constrict our ability to sell, expand or acquire facilities; and    generally impact our financial performance. We have accrued    liabilities for environmental    clean-up    sites, including sites for which governmental agencies have    designated us as a potentially responsible party, where it is    probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of    loss can be reasonably estimated. See Legal    Proceedings (Part I, Item 3). However, because    of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment    and remediation activities, future expense to remediate    currently identified sites and other sites, which could be    identified in the future for cleanup, could be higher than the    liabilities accrued. Healthcare    reform legislation could have an impact on our    business.     During 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and    the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 were    signed into law in the United States. Certain of the provisions    that could most significantly increase our healthcare costs in    the near term include the removal of annual plan limits, the    changes in rules regarding eligibility for dependents and the    mandate that health plans cover 100% of preventative care. In    addition, our healthcare costs could increase if the new    legislation and accompanying regulations require us to cover    more employees than we do currently or pay penalty amounts in    the event that employees do not elect our offered coverage.    While much of the cost of the recent healthcare legislation    enacted will occur in or after 2014 due to provisions of the    legislation being phased in over time, changes to our healthcare    cost structure could have an impact on our business and    operating costs. We are    subject to risks associated with the availability and coverage    of various types of insurance.     We have various types of insurance, including property,    workers compensation and general liability. Insurance    costs can be unpredictable and may adversely impact our    financial results. We retain some portion of our insurable    risks, and therefore, unforeseen or catastrophic losses in    excess of insured limits could have a material adverse effect on    our financial results. Changes    in our tax rates could affect our future results.     Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in    the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax    rates, expirations of tax holidays, changes in the valuation of    deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws and    regulations or their interpretation. We are subject to the    regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax    authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse    outcomes resulting from these    11     examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for    taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these    examinations will not have a material adverse effect on our    financial condition and operating results. The    amount of various taxes we pay is subject to ongoing compliance    requirements and audits by federal, state and foreign tax    authorities.     Our estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues is    subject to our assessment of relevant risks, facts, and    circumstances existing at that time. We use these assessments to    determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and    other tax-related accounts. Our future results may include    favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax    liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved,    which may impact our effective tax rate    and/or our    financial results. We have    deferred tax assets that we may not be able to use under certain    circumstances.     If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in    certain jurisdictions, or if there is a significant change in    the time period within which the underlying temporary    differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required    to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax    assets. This would result in an increase in our effective tax    rate and would have an adverse effect on our future operating    results. In addition, changes in statutory tax rates may change    our deferred tax assets or liability balances, with either    favorable or unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate. Our    deferred tax assets may also be impacted by new legislation or    regulation.     The risks described above are not exclusive. If any of the above    risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash    flows or financial condition could suffer, which might cause the    value of our securities to decline. "
14,AVY,AVERY DENNISON CORP,2010-03-01,">Item 1A.      RISK    FACTORS     Our ability to attain our goals and objectives is materially    dependent on numerous factors and risks, including but not    limited to, the following: Adverse    conditions in the global economy have negatively impacted our    customers, suppliers and our business.     The United States, Europe and Asia have experienced significant    declines in economic activity, including, among other things,    reduced consumer spending, inflation, declines in asset    valuations, diminished liquidity and credit availability,    significant volatility in securities prices, rating downgrades,    and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These    economic developments have adversely affected our customers,    suppliers and businesses similar to ours and have resulted in a    variety of negative effects, such as reduction in revenues,    increased costs, lower gross margin percentages, increased    allowances for doubtful accounts    and/or    write-offs of accounts    5Table of Contents    receivable, required recognition of impairments of capitalized    assets, including goodwill and other intangibles, and such    developments could have other material adverse effects on our    business, results of operations, financial condition and cash    flows. We are not able to predict the duration and severity of    adverse economic conditions in the U.S. and other    countries, and there can be no assurance that there will not be    further declines in economic activity. The    demand for our products is impacted by the effects of, and    changes in, worldwide conditions, which could have an adverse    effect on our sales and profitability.     We have operations in over 60 countries and our domestic and    international operations are strongly influenced by matters    beyond our control, including changes in political, social,    economic and labor conditions, tax laws (including    U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), and international    trade regulations (including tariffs), as well as the impact of    these changes on the underlying demand for our products. We are    affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences. If    we do not compete effectively, we could lose market share and    experience falling prices, adversely affecting our financial    results.     We are at risk that our competitors will expand in our key    markets and implement new technologies making them more    competitive. Competitors also may be able to offer additional    products, services, lower prices, or other incentives that we    cannot or will not offer or that will make our products less    profitable. There can be no assurance that we will be able to    compete successfully against current and future competitors.     We also are at risk with regard to changes in customer order    patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained    by customers and the timing of customer purchases, which may be    affected by announced price changes, changes in the    Companys incentive programs, or changes in the    customers ability to achieve incentive goals. Changes in    customers preferences for our products can also affect the    demand for our products. Our business could be negatively    impacted by a decline in demand for our products. As a    manufacturer, our sales and profitability are dependent upon the    cost and availability of raw materials and energy, which are    subject to price fluctuations, and our ability to control or    pass on costs of raw materials and labor.     Inflationary and other increases in the costs of raw materials,    labor and energy have occurred in the past and are expected to    recur, and our performance depends in part on our ability to    pass on these cost increases to customers through our selling    prices for products and to effect improvements in productivity.    Also, it is important for us to obtain timely delivery of    materials, equipment, and other resources from suppliers, and to    make timely delivery to customers. A disruption to our supply    chain could adversely affect our sales and profitability. Foreign    currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in those rates, may    affect our sales and profitability.     Approximately 66% of our sales are from international    operations. Fluctuations in currencies can cause transaction,    translation and other losses to us, which can negatively impact    our sales and profitability. Margins on sales of our products in    foreign countries could be materially and adversely affected by    foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.     We monitor our foreign currency exposures and may, from time to    time, use hedging instruments to mitigate exposure to changes in    foreign currencies. Hedging activities may only offset a portion    of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in    foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in    place. Our    future results may be affected if we generate less productivity    improvement than projected.     We intend to continue efforts to reduce costs in many of our    operations through facility closures, headcount reductions,    organizational restructuring, process standardization, and    manufacturing relocation, by using a variety of tools, such as    Lean Sigma and Kaizen events, to increase productivity. However,    the success of these efforts is not assured and lower levels of    productivity could reduce profitability. In addition, cost    reduction actions could expose us to additional production risk    and loss of sales.    6Table of ContentsWe have    acquired companies and may continue to acquire other companies.    Acquisitions come with significant risks and uncertainties,    including those related to integration, technology and    personnel.     To grow our product lines and expand into new markets, we have    made acquisitions and may do so in the future. For example, we    acquired DM Label and Paxar in 2008 and 2007, respectively.    Various risks, uncertainties, and costs are associated with the    acquisitions. Effective integration of systems, controls,    objectives, personnel, product lines, markets, customers,    suppliers, and production facilities and cost savings can be    difficult to achieve, and the results of integration actions are    uncertain, particularly given our geographically dispersed    organization. In addition, we may not be able to retain key    personnel of an acquired company and we may not be able to    successfully execute integration strategies or achieve projected    performance targets for the business segment into which an    acquired company is integrated. Both prior to and after the    closing of a transaction, our business and those of the acquired    company or companies may suffer due to uncertainty or diversion    of management attention.     There can be no assurance that any acquisitions will be    successful and contribute to our profitability and we may not be    able to identify new acquisition opportunities in the future. Declines    or slower growth in key markets could adversely affect our    profitability.     Our business could be negatively impacted by declines or slower    growth in key end-use markets. Our overall performance will be    influenced by these markets. Our    customer base is diversified, but in certain portions of our    business, industry concentration has increased the importance,    and decreased the number of, significant customers.     Sales of our office and consumer products in the United States    are concentrated in a few major customers, principally office    product superstores, mass market distributors and wholesalers.    The business risk associated with this concentration, including    increased credit risks for these and other customers, and the    possibility of related bad debt write-offs, could negatively    affect our margins and profits. Possible    increased difficulty in the collection of receivables as a    result of economic conditions or other market factors could have    a material effect on our results from operations and anticipated    cash from operating activities.     Although we have processes to administer credit granted to    customers and believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is    adequate, we have experienced, and in the future may experience,    losses as a result of our inability to collect our accounts    receivable. The financial difficulties of a customer could    result in reduced business with that customer. We may also    assume higher credit risk relating to receivables of a customer    experiencing financial difficulty. If these developments occur,    our inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on    our trade accounts receivable from major customers could    substantially reduce our income and have a material adverse    effect on our results of operations and cash flows from    operating activities. Our    ability to develop and successfully market new products and    applications is important for our business.     The timely introduction of new products and improvements in    current products helps determine our success. Research and    development for each of our operating segments is complex and    uncertain and requires innovation and anticipation of market    trends. We could focus on products that ultimately are not    accepted by customers or we could suffer delays in production or    launch of new products that could compromise our competitive    position in such product markets. For us to    remain competitive, it is important to recruit and retain    highly-skilled employees. We also utilize various outsourcing    arrangements for certain services.     There is significant competition to recruit and retain skilled    employees. Due to expansion in certain markets and the ongoing    productivity efforts and recent employee reductions, it may be    difficult for us to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of    highly-skilled employees.    7Table of Contents    We have outsourced certain services to multiple third-party    service providers, and may outsource other services in the    future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies. Service    provider delays, resource availability, business issues or    errors may lead to disruption in our businesses    and/or    increased costs. If we do not effectively develop, implement and    manage outsourcing strategies, if third-party providers do not    perform effectively and in a timely manner, or if we experience    problems with a transition, we may not be able to achieve our    expected cost savings, and may have to experience delays or    incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service    providers. Significant    disruption to our information technology infrastructure could    adversely impact our operations, sales, customer relations, and    financial results.     We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a large    and complex information technology infrastructure to link our    worldwide divisions. Like other information technology systems,    ours is susceptible to a number of factors including, but not    limited to, damage or interruptions resulting from a variety of    causes such as obsolescence, natural disasters, power failures,    human error, viruses and data security breaches. We upgrade and    install new systems, which, if installed or programmed    incorrectly or on a delayed timeframe, could cause delays or    cancellations of customer orders, impede the manufacture or    shipment of products, or disrupt the processing of transactions.    We have implemented certain measures to reduce our risk related    to system and network disruptions, but if a disruption occurs,    we could incur significant losses and remediation costs.     Additionally, we rely on services provided by third-party    vendors for a significant portion of our information technology    support, development and implementation, which may make our    operations vulnerable to such third parties failure to    perform adequately. Miscalculation    of our infrastructure needs could adversely impact our financial    results.     Projected requirements of our infrastructure investments may    differ from actual levels if our volume growth is not as we    anticipate. Our infrastructure investments generally are    long-term in nature, and it is possible that these investments    may not generate our expected return due to changes in the    marketplace, failures to complete implementation, or other    factors. Significant changes from our expected need for    and/or    returns on infrastructure investments could adversely affect our    financial results. Our    reputation, sales, and earnings could be affected adversely if    the quality of our products and services does not meet customer    expectations.     There are occasions when we manufacture products with quality    issues resulting from defective materials, manufacturing,    packaging or design. Many of these issues are discovered before    shipping, thus causing delays in shipping, delays in the    manufacturing process, and occasionally cancelled orders. When    issues are discovered after shipment, it can result in    additional shipping costs, discounts, refunds, and loss of    future sales. Both pre-shipping and post-shipping quality issues    can result in adverse financial consequences and a negative    impact on our reputation. Some of    our products are sold by third parties.     Our products are not sold only by us, but by third-party    distributors and retailers as well. Some of our distributors    also market products that compete with our products. Changes in    the financial or business conditions or the purchasing decisions    of these third parties or their customers could affect our sales    and profitability. We    outsource some of our manufacturing. If there are significant    changes in the quality control or financial or business    condition of these outsourced manufacturers, our business could    be negatively impacted.     We manufacture most of our products, but we also use third-party    manufacturers, for example, for specialty jobs or capacity    overflow. Outsourced manufacturers reduce our ability to prevent    product quality issues, late deliveries, customer    dissatisfaction and compliance with customer requirements for    labor standards. Because of possible quality issues and customer    dissatisfaction, outsourced manufacturers could have an adverse    effect on our business or financial results.    8Table of ContentsChanges    in our business strategies may increase our costs and could    affect the profitability of our businesses.     As changes in our business environment occur, we may need to    adjust our business strategies to meet these changes or we may    find it otherwise necessary to restructure our operations or    particular businesses. When these changes occur, we may incur    costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down    the value of selected assets. We also may need to invest in new    businesses that have short-term returns that are negative or low    and whose ultimate business prospects are uncertain. In any of    these events, our costs may increase, our assets may be    impaired, or our returns on new investments may be lower than    prior to the change in strategy. Our    substantial indebtedness could limit our ability to incur    additional debt to fund business needs over the medium    term.     As a result of the acquisitions in 2008 and 2007, our debt    levels had significantly increased. Although we have reduced    debt since the time of these acquisitions and we anticipate    further debt reduction over the medium term from the generation    of cash flow in our underlying businesses, circumstances both    within and beyond our control could cause debt levels to remain    elevated for a longer timeframe than anticipated. These higher    debt levels could negatively impact our ability to meet other    business needs or opportunities and could result in higher    financing costs. If our    credit ratings are downgraded, we may have difficulty obtaining    acceptable short- and long-term financing from the capital    markets.     Credit ratings are a significant factor in our ability to raise    short-term and long-term financing. The credit ratings assigned    to us also impact the interest rates on our commercial paper and    other borrowings. If our credit ratings are downgraded, our    financial flexibility could decrease and the cost to borrow    would increase. The level    of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the    actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect    our earnings and cash flows in future periods. Changes in    accounting standards and government regulations could also    affect our pension and postretirement plan expense and funding    requirements.     Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations    and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and other    postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by us in consultation    with outside actuaries. In the event that we determine that    changes are warranted in the assumptions used, such as the    discount rate, expected long term rate of return, or health care    costs, our future pension and projected postretirement benefit    expenses and funding requirements could increase or decrease.    Because of changing market conditions or changes in the    participant population, the actuarial assumptions that we use    may differ from actual results, which could have a significant    impact on our pension and postretirement liability and related    costs. Funding obligations are determined based on the value of    assets and liabilities on a specific date as required under    relevant government regulations for each plan. Future pension    funding requirements, and the timing of funding payments, could    be affected by legislation enacted by the relevant governmental    authorities. Our share    price may be volatile.     Changes in our stock price may affect our access to or cost of    financing from capital markets and may affect our stock-based    compensation arrangements, among other things. Our stock price,    which has at times experienced substantial volatility, is    influenced by changes in the overall stock market and demand for    equity securities in general. Other factors, including current    performance and market expectations for our future performance,    the level of perceived growth of our industries, and other    company-specific events, can also impact our share price. There    can be no assurance that our stock price will be less volatile    in the future. An    impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively    impact our consolidated results of operations and net    worth.     Goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is not    amortized, but is reviewed for impairment at least annually (or    more frequently, if impairment indicators are present). In    assessing the carrying value of goodwill, we    9Table of Contents    make estimates and assumptions about sales, operating margins,    growth rates, and discount rates based on our business plans,    economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and    marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties related to    these factors and managements judgment in applying these    factors. Goodwill valuations have been calculated using an    income approach based on the present value of future cash flows    of each reporting unit. We could be required to evaluate the    carrying value of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we    experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant    declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant    component of our business or sustained market capitalization    declines. These types of events and the resulting analyses could    result in goodwill impairment charges in the future. Impairment    charges could substantially affect our financial results in the    periods of such charges. Potential    adverse developments in legal proceedings, investigations and    other legal, compliance and regulatory matters, including those    involving product and trade compliance, Foreign Corrupt    Practices Act issues and other matters, could impact us    materially.     Our financial results could be materially adversely impacted by    an unfavorable outcome to pending or future litigation and    investigations, including but not limited to, proceedings or    lawsuits related to class actions seeking treble damages for    alleged unlawful competitive practices, the impact of potential    violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act    (FCPA), and other legal, compliance and regulatory    matters, including, but not limited to, product, customs and    trade compliance matters. See Legal Proceedings    (Part  I, Item 3). There can be no assurance that    any investigation or litigation outcome will be favorable. Infringing    intellectual property rights of third parties or inadequately    acquiring or protecting our intellectual property and patents    could harm our ability to compete or grow.     Because our products involve complex technology and chemistry,    we are involved, from time to time, in litigation involving    patents and other intellectual property. Parties have filed, and    in the future may file, claims against us alleging that we have    infringed their intellectual property rights. If we are held    liable for infringement, we could be required to pay damages,    obtain licenses or cease making or selling certain products.    There can be no assurance that licenses will be available on    commercially reasonable terms or will be available at all. The    defense of these claims, whether or not meritorious, and the    development of new technology could cause us to incur    significant costs and could divert the attention of management.     We also could have our intellectual property infringed. We    attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual    property and proprietary information, by relying on the patent,    trademark, copyright and trade secret laws of the U.S. and    other countries, as well as on nondisclosure agreements.    However, it may be possible for a third party to obtain our    information without our authorization, to independently develop    similar technologies, or to breach a non-disclosure agreement    entered into with us. In addition, many of the countries in    which we operate do not have intellectual property laws that    protect proprietary rights as fully as in the U.S. The use    of our intellectual property by someone else without our    authorization could reduce or eliminate certain competitive    advantages we have, cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our    business. Further, the costs associated with protecting our    intellectual property rights could adversely impact our    profitability.     We have obtained and applied for some U.S. and foreign    trademark registrations and patents, and will continue to    evaluate whether to register additional trademarks and seek    patents as appropriate. We cannot guarantee that any of the    pending applications will be approved by the applicable    government authorities. Further, we cannot assure that the    validity of our patents or our trademarks will not be    challenged. In addition, third parties may be able to develop    competing products using technology that avoids our patents. We need    to comply with numerous environmental, health, and safety    laws.     Due to the nature of our business, we are subject to    environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations,    including those related to the disposal of hazardous waste from    our manufacturing processes. Compliance with existing and future    environmental, health and safety laws could subject us to future    costs or liabilities; impact our production capabilities;    constrict our ability to sell, expand or acquire facilities; and    generally impact our financial performance. We have accrued    liabilities for environmental    clean-up    sites, including sites for which governmental    10Table of Contents    agencies have designated us as a potentially responsible party,    where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost    or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. However, because    of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment    and remediation activities, future expense to remediate    currently identified sites and other sites, which could be    identified in the future for cleanup, could be higher than the    liability currently accrued. We are    subject to risks associated with the availability and coverage    of various types of insurance.     We have various types of insurance including property, workers    compensation and general liability. Insurance costs can be    unpredictable and may adversely impact our financial results. We    retain some portion of our insurable risks, and therefore,    unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits    could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Proposed    changes in U.S. tax legislation could materially impact our    results.     Currently, the majority of our revenue is generated from    customers located outside of the U.S., and a substantial portion    of our assets and our employees, are located outside of the    U.S. We have not accrued income taxes and foreign    withholding taxes on undistributed earnings for most    non-U.S. subsidiaries,    because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested    in the operations of those subsidiaries. Certain proposals could    substantially increase our tax expense, which would    substantially reduce our income and have a material adverse    effect on our results of operations and cash flows from    operating activities. Changes    in our tax rates could affect our future results.     Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in    the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax    rates, expirations of tax holidays, changes in the valuation of    deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws and    regulations or their interpretation. We are subject to the    regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax    authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse    outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the    adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance    that the outcomes from these examinations will not have a    material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating    results. The    amount of various taxes we pay is subject to ongoing compliance    requirements and audits by federal, state and foreign tax    authorities.     Our estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues is    subject to our assessment of relevant risks, facts, and    circumstances existing at that time. We use these assessments to    determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and    other tax-related accounts. Our future results may include    favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax    liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved,    which may impact our effective tax rate    and/or our    financial results. We have    deferred tax assets that we may not be able to use under certain    circumstances.     If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in    certain jurisdictions, or if there is a significant change in    the time period within which the underlying temporary    differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required    to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax    assets. This would result in an increase in our effective tax    rate, and would have an adverse effect on our future operating    results. In addition, changes in statutory tax rates may change    our deferred tax assets or liability balances, with either    favorable or unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate. Our    deferred tax assets may also be impacted by new legislation or    regulation.     The risks described above are not exclusive. If any of the above    risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash    flows or financial condition could suffer, which might cause the    value of our securities to decline. "
2,AVY,AVERY DENNISON CORP,2009-02-25,">Item 1A.      RISK    FACTORS     Our ability to attain our goals and objectives is materially    dependent on numerous factors and risks, including but not    limited to, the following: The    demand for our products is impacted by the effects of, and    changes in, worldwide conditions, which could have an adverse    effect on our sales and profitability.     We have operations in over 60 countries and our domestic and    international operations are strongly influenced by matters    beyond our control, including changes in the political, social,    economic and labor conditions, tax laws (including    U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), and international    trade regulations (including tariffs) in the countries in which    we operate, as well as the impact of these conditions on the    underlying demand for our products.    5Table of ContentsAdverse    conditions in the global economy and disruption of financial    markets could negatively impact our customers, suppliers and our    business.     Financial markets in the United States, Europe and Asia have    experienced significant disruption in recent months, including,    among other things, significant volatility in security prices,    severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating    downgrades, declines in asset valuations, inflation, reduced    consumer spending, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange    rates. While currently these conditions have not impaired our    ability to access credit markets and finance our operations,    there can be no assurance that there will not be a further    deterioration in financial markets in major economies. These    economic developments affect our customers and our suppliers and    businesses such as ours. In addition, they could have a variety    of negative effects such as reduction in revenues, increased    costs, lower gross margin percentages, increased allowances for    doubtful accounts    and/or    write-offs of accounts receivable, require recognition of    impairments of capitalized assets, including goodwill and other    intangibles, and could otherwise have material adverse effects    on our business, results of operations, financial condition and    cash flows.     We are not able to predict the duration and severity of the    current disruption in financial markets and adverse economic    conditions in the U.S. and other countries. Foreign    currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in those rates, may    affect our sales and profitability.     Approximately 65% of our sales are from international    operations. Fluctuations in currencies can cause transaction,    translation and other losses to us, which can negatively impact    our sales and profitability. Margins on sales of our products in    foreign countries could be materially and adversely affected by    foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.     We monitor our foreign currency exposures and may, from time to    time, use hedging instruments to mitigate exposure to certain    transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The use of such    hedging activities may not offset any, or more than a portion    of, the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in    foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in    place. We are    affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences. If    we do not compete effectively, we could lose market share and    experience falling prices, adversely affecting our financial    results.     We are at risk that our competitors will expand in our key    markets and implement new technologies making them more    competitive. There is also the possibility that competitors will    be able to offer additional products, services, lower prices, or    other incentives that we cannot or will not offer or that will    make our products less profitable. There can be no assurance    that we will be able to compete successfully against current and    future competitors.     We are also at risk with regards to changes in customer order    patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained    by customers and the timing of customer purchases, which may be    affected by announced price changes, changes in the    Companys incentive programs, or the customers    ability to achieve incentive goals. Changes in customers    preferences for our products can also affect the demand for our    products. As a    manufacturer, our sales and profitability are dependent upon the    cost and availability of raw materials and energy, which are    subject to price fluctuations, and our ability to control or    pass on costs of raw materials and labor.     Inflationary and other increases in the costs of raw materials,    labor and energy have occurred in the past and are expected to    recur, and our performance depends in part on our ability to    pass on these cost increases to customers in our selling prices    for products, and to effect improvements in productivity. Also,    it is important that we are able to obtain timely delivery of    materials, equipment, and packaging from suppliers, and to make    timely delivery to customers. A disruption to our supply chain    could adversely affect our sales and profitability.    6Table of ContentsPotential    adverse developments in legal proceedings, investigations and    other legal, compliance and regulatory matters, including those    involving product and trade compliance, Foreign Corrupt    Practices Act issues and other matters, could impact us    materially.     Our financial results could be materially adversely impacted by    an unfavorable outcome to pending or future litigation and    investigations, including but not limited to, proceedings or    lawsuits related to class actions seeking treble damages for    alleged unlawful competitive practices, the impact of potential    violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and    other legal, compliance and regulatory matters, including, but    not limited to, product, customs and trade compliance matters.    See Item 1, Legal Proceedings. There can be no    assurance that any investigation or litigation outcome will be    favorable. Our    future results may be affected if we generate less productivity    improvement than projected.     We are undertaking efforts to reduce costs in many of our    operations, including closure of facilities, headcount    reductions, organizational simplification and restructuring,    process standardization, and manufacturing relocation, and using    a variety of tools such as Lean Sigma and Kaizen events, to    increase productivity, which is not assured. Lower levels of    productivity could reduce profitability. In addition, cost    reduction actions could expose us to additional production risk    and loss of sales. We have    acquired companies and may continue to acquire other companies.    Acquisitions come with significant risks and uncertainties,    including those related to integration, technology and    personnel.     In order to grow our product lines and expand into new markets,    we have made acquisitions and may do so in the future. For    example, we acquired DM Label and Paxar in 2008 and 2007,    respectively. Various risks, uncertainties, and costs are    associated with the acquisitions. Effective integration of    systems, controls, objectives, personnel, product lines,    markets, customers, suppliers, production facilities and cost    savings can be difficult to achieve and the results are    uncertain, particularly across our geographically dispersed    organization. We may not be able to retain key personnel of an    acquired company and we may not be able to successfully execute    integration strategies or achieve projected performance targets    set for the business segment into which an acquired company is    integrated. Both prior to and after the closing of the    transactions, our business and those of the acquired company or    companies may suffer due to uncertainty or diversion of    management attention.     There can be no assurance that acquisitions will be successful    and contribute to our profitability and we may not be able to    identify new acquisition opportunities in the future. Our    substantial indebtedness could limit our ability to incur    additional debt to fund business needs over the medium    term.     As a result of the Paxar acquisition in 2007, our debt levels    approximately doubled. Although significant debt reduction is    anticipated over the medium term from the generation of cash    flow in our underlying businesses, circumstances both within and    beyond our control could cause debt levels to remain elevated    for a longer time frame than anticipated. These higher debt    levels could negatively impact our ability to meet other    business needs or opportunities and could result in higher    financing costs. Slower    growth in key markets could adversely affect our    profitability.     Our business could be negatively impacted by a decline in key    end use markets or applications for our products. Our overall    performance will be influenced by these markets. Our    customers are widely diversified, but in certain portions of our    business, industry concentration has increased the importance    and decreased the number of significant customers.     In particular, sales of our office and consumer products in the    United States are concentrated in a few major customers,    principally office product superstores, mass market distributors    and wholesalers. The business risk associated with this    concentration, including increased credit risks for these and    other customers, and the possibility of related bad debt    write-offs, could negatively affect our margins and profits.    7Table of ContentsOur    ability to develop and successfully market new products and    applications is important for our business.     The timely introduction of new products and improvements in    current products helps determine our success. Research and    development for each of our operating segments is complex and    uncertain and requires innovation and anticipation of market    trends. We could focus on products that ultimately are not    accepted by customers or we could suffer delays in production or    launch of new products that could compromise our competitive    position in such product markets. Infringing    intellectual property rights of third parties or inadequately    acquiring or protecting our intellectual property and patents    could harm our ability to compete or grow.     Because our products involve complex technology and chemistry,    we are from time to time involved in litigation involving    patents and other intellectual property. Parties have filed, and    in the future may file, claims against us alleging that we have    infringed their intellectual property rights. If we are held    liable for infringement, we could be required to pay damages or    obtain licenses or to cease making or selling certain products.    There can be no assurance that licenses will be available at    all, or will be available on commercially reasonable terms, and    the cost to defend these claims, whether or not meritorious, or    to develop new technology could be significant and could divert    the attention of management.     We also could have our intellectual property infringed. We    attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual    property and proprietary information, by relying on the patent,    trademark, copyright and trade secret laws of the U.S. and    other countries, as well as on nondisclosure agreements, but it    may be possible for a third party to obtain our information    without our authorization, to independently develop similar    technologies, or to breach a non-disclosure agreement entered    into with us. In addition, many of the countries in which we    operate do not have intellectual property laws that protect    proprietary rights as fully as in the U.S. The use of our    intellectual property by someone else without our authorization    could reduce or eliminate certain competitive advantages we    have, cause us to lose sales, or otherwise harm our business.    Further, the costs involved to protect our intellectual property    rights could adversely impact our profitability.     We have obtained and applied for some U.S. and foreign    trademark registrations and patents, and will continue to    evaluate whether to register additional trademarks and seek    patents as appropriate. We cannot guarantee that any of the    pending applications will be approved by the applicable    government authorities. Further, we cannot assure that the    validity of our patents or our trademarks will not be    challenged. In addition, third parties might be able to develop    competing products using technology that avoids our patents. Changes    in our tax rates could affect our future results.     Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in    the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax    rates, expirations of tax holidays, changes in the valuation of    deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws and    regulations or their interpretation. We are subject to the    regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax    authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse    outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the    adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance    that the outcomes from these examinations will not have a    material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating    results. The    amount of various taxes we pay is subject to ongoing compliance    requirements and audits by federal, state and foreign tax    authorities.     Our estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues is    subject to our assessment of relevant risks, facts, and    circumstances existing at that time. We use these assessments to    determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and    other tax-related accounts. Our future results may include    favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax    liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved,    which may impact our effective tax rate    and/or our    financial results. We have    deferred tax assets that we may not be able to use under certain    circumstances.     If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in    certain jurisdictions, or if there is a significant change in    the time period within which the underlying temporary    differences become taxable or deductible, we    8Table of Contents    could be required to increase our valuation allowances against    our deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase in our    effective tax rate, and an adverse effect on our future    operating results. In addition, changes in statutory tax rates    may also change our deferred tax assets or liability balances,    with either favorable or unfavorable impact on our effective tax    rate. Our deferred tax assets may also be impacted by new    legislation or regulation. The level    of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the    actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect    our earnings and cash flows in future periods. Changes in    accounting standards and government regulations could also    affect our pension and postretirement plan expense and funding    requirements.     Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations    and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and other    postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by us in consultation    with outside actuaries. In the event that we determine that    changes are warranted in the assumptions used, such as the    discount rate, expected long term rate of return, or health care    costs, our future pension and projected postretirement benefit    expenses could increase or decrease. Due to changing market    conditions or changes in the participant population, the    actuarial assumptions that we use may differ from actual    results, which could have a significant impact on our pension    and postretirement liability and related costs. Funding    obligations are determined based on the value of assets and    liabilities on a specific date as required under relevant    government regulations for each plan. Future pension funding    requirements, and the timing of funding payments, could be    affected by legislation enacted by the relevant governmental    authorities. In order    for us to remain competitive, it is important to recruit and    retain highly-skilled employees. We also utilize various    outsourcing arrangements for certain services.     There is significant competition to recruit and retain skilled    employees. Due to expansion in certain markets and the ongoing    productivity efforts and recent employee reductions, it may be    difficult for us to retain and recruit sufficient numbers of    highly-skilled employees.     We have outsourced certain services to multiple third-party    service providers, and may outsource other services in the    future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies. Service    provider delays, resource availability, business issues or    errors may lead to disruption in our businesses    and/or    increased costs. If we do not effectively develop, implement and    manage outsourcing strategies, or if third-party providers do    not perform effectively and timely, or we experience problems    with a transition, we may not be able to achieve our expected    cost savings, and may have to incur additional costs and    experience delays to correct errors made by such service    providers. We need    to comply with numerous environmental, health, and safety    laws.     Due to the nature of our business, we are subject to    environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations,    including those related to the disposal of hazardous waste from    our manufacturing processes. Compliance with existing and future    environmental, health and safety laws could subject us to future    costs or liabilities; impact our production capabilities;    constrict our ability to sell, expand or acquire facilities; and    generally impact our financial performance. We have accrued    liabilities for environmental    clean-up    sites, including sites for which governmental agencies have    designated us as a potentially responsible party, where it is    probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of    loss can be reasonably estimated. However, because of the    uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and    remediation activities, future expense to remediate currently    identified sites and other sites, which could be identified in    the future for cleanup, could be higher than the liability    currently accrued. We are    subject to risks associated with the availability and coverage    of various types of insurance.     We have various types of insurance including property, workers    compensation and general liability. Insurance costs can be    unpredictable and may adversely impact our financial results. We    retain some portion of our insurable risks, and therefore,    unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits    could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.    9Table of ContentsSignificant    disruption to our information technology infrastructure could    adversely impact our operations, sales, customer relations, and    financial results.     We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a large    and complex information technology infrastructure to link our    worldwide divisions. Like other information technology systems,    ours is susceptible to a number of factors including, but not    limited to, damage or interruptions resulting from a variety of    causes such as obsolescence, natural disasters, power failures,    human error, viruses and data security breaches. We upgrade and    install new systems, which, if installed or programmed    incorrectly or if installation is delayed, could cause delays or    cancellation of customer orders, impede the manufacture or    shipment of products, and disrupt the processing of    transactions. We have implemented certain measures to reduce our    risk related to system and network disruptions, but if a    disruption occurs, we could incur significant losses and    remediation costs.     Additionally, we rely on services provided by third-party    vendors for a significant portion of our information technology    support, development and implementation, which may make our    operations vulnerable to such third parties failure to    perform adequately. Miscalculation    of our infrastructure needs could adversely impact our financial    results.     Projected requirements of our infrastructure investments may    differ from actual levels if our volume growth is not as we    anticipate. Our infrastructure investments are generally    long-term in nature, and it is possible that these investments    may not generate our expected return due to changes in the    marketplace, failures to complete implementation, and other    factors. Significant changes from our expected need for    and/or    returns on infrastructure investments could adversely affect our    financial results. Our share    price may be volatile.     Our stock price, which has at times experienced substantial    volatility, is influenced by changes in the overall stock market    and demand for equity securities in general. Other factors,    including current performance and market expectations for our    future performance, the level of perceived growth of our    industries, and announcements concerning investigations, can    also impact our share price. There can be no assurance that our    stock price will be less volatile in the future. If our    credit ratings are downgraded, we may have difficulty obtaining    acceptable short- and long-term financing from capital    markets.     Credit ratings are a significant factor in our ability to raise    short-term and long-term financing. The credit ratings assigned    to us also impact the interest rates on our commercial paper and    other borrowings. If our credit ratings are further downgraded,    our financial flexibility could decrease and the cost to borrow    would increase. Our    reputation, sales, and earnings could be affected adversely if    the quality of our products and services does not meet customer    expectations.     There are occasions when we manufacture products with quality    issues resulting from defective materials, manufacturing,    packaging or design. Many of these issues are discovered before    shipping, thus causing delays in shipping, delays in the    manufacturing process, and occasionally cancelled orders. When    issues are discovered after shipment, this causes additional    shipping costs, possible discounts, possible refunds, and    potential loss of future sales. Both pre-shipping and    post-shipping quality issues can result in financial    consequences along with a negative impact on our reputation. Some of    our products are sold by third parties.     Our products are not only sold by us, but by third-party    distributors and retailers as well. Some of our distributors    also market products that compete with our products. Changes in    the financial or business condition or purchasing decisions of    these third parties or their customers could affect our sales    and profitability.    10Table of ContentsWe    outsource some of our manufacturing. If there are significant    changes in the quality control or financial or business    condition of these outsourced manufacturers, our business could    be negatively impacted.     We manufacture most of our products, but we also use third-party    manufacturers, for example, for specialty jobs or capacity    overflow. Outsourced manufacturers reduce our ability to prevent    product quality issues, late deliveries, customer    dissatisfaction and compliance with customer requirements for    labor standards. Because of possible quality issues and customer    dissatisfaction, outsourced manufacturers could have an adverse    effect on our business and financial results. An    impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively    impact our consolidated results of operations and net    worth.     Goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is not    amortized, but is reviewed for impairment at least annually or    more frequently if impairment indicators are present. In    assessing the carrying value of goodwill, we make estimates and    assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates, and    discount rates based on our business plans, economic    projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data.    There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and    managements judgment in applying these factors. Goodwill    valuations have been calculated using an income approach based    on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting    unit. We could be required to evaluate the carrying value of    goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience    disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in    operating results, divestiture of a significant component of our    business or sustained market capitalization declines. These    types of events and the resulting analyses could result in    goodwill impairment charges in the future. Impairment charges    could substantially affect our financial results in the periods    of such charges. Changes    in our business strategies may increase our costs and could    affect the profitability of our businesses.     As changes in our business environment occur, we may need to    adjust our business strategies to meet these changes or we may    otherwise find it necessary to restructure our operations or    particular businesses. When these changes occur, we may incur    costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down    the value of assets. We may also need to invest in new    businesses that have short-term returns that are negative or low    and whose ultimate business prospects are uncertain. In any of    these events, our costs may increase, our assets may be    impaired, or our returns on new investments may be lower than    prior to the change in strategy.     The risks described above are not exclusive. If any of the above    risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash    flows or financial condition could suffer, which might cause the    value of our securities to decline. "
18,AVY,AVERY DENNISON CORP,2008-02-27,">Item 1A.      RISK    FACTORS     Our ability to attain our goals and objectives is materially    dependent on numerous factors and risks, including but not    limited to, the following: The    demand for our products is impacted by economic conditions of    the principal countries in which we operate. A decline in the    economies in these countries could have an adverse effect on our    sales and profitability.     We have operations in 60 countries and our domestic and    international operations are strongly influenced by matters    beyond our control, including changes in the political, social,    economic, tax and regulatory environments (including tariffs) in    the countries in which we operate, as well as the impact of    economic conditions on underlying demand for our products. In    addition, approximately 60% of our sales are from international    operations.    5Table of Contents    Fluctuations in currencies can cause transaction, translation    and other losses to us, which can negatively impact our sales    and profitability. We    operate in some highly competitive markets. If we do not compete    effectively, we could lose market share and experience falling    prices, adversely affecting our financial results.     We are at risk that our competitors will expand in our key    markets and implement new technologies making them more    competitive. There is also the possibility that competitors will    be able to offer additional products, services, lower prices, or    other incentives that we cannot or will not offer or that will    make our products less profitable. There can be no assurance    that we will be able to compete successfully against current and    future competitors.     We are also at risk with regards to changes in customer order    patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained    by customers and the timing of customer purchases, which may be    affected by announced price changes, changes in the    Companys incentive programs, or the customers    ability to achieve incentive goals. Changes in customers    preferences for our products can also affect the demand for our    products. We have    acquired companies and our interest in various acquisition    opportunities has increased. Acquisitions come with significant    risks and uncertainties, including those related to integration,    technology and personnel.     In order to grow our product lines and expand into new markets,    we have made acquisitions and may do so in the future, for    example, we acquired Paxar Corporation in 2007. Various risks,    uncertainties, and costs are associated with the acquisitions.    Effective integration of systems, controls, objectives,    personnel, product lines, markets, customers, suppliers,    production facilities and cost savings can be difficult to    achieve and the results are uncertain, particularly across our    geographically dispersed organization. We may not be able to    retain key personnel of an acquired company and we may not be    able to successfully execute integration strategies or achieve    projected performance targets set for the business segment into    which an acquired company is integrated. Both prior to and after    the closing of the transactions, our business and those of the    acquired companies may suffer due to uncertainty or diversion of    management attention.     There can be no assurance that acquisitions will be successful    and contribute to our profitability and we may not be able to    identify new acquisition opportunities in the future. Our    increased level of indebtedness following the Paxar acquisition    could limit our ability to incur additional debt to fund    business needs over the medium term.     As a result of the Paxar acquisition, our debt levels    approximately doubled. Although significant debt reduction is    anticipated over the medium term from both the cash flow    generation of our underlying businesses and the synergies    expected from the acquisition, circumstances both within and    beyond our control could cause debt levels to remain elevated    for a longer time frame than anticipated. These higher debt    levels could negatively impact our ability to meet other    business needs or opportunities and could result in higher    financing costs. Potential    adverse developments in legal proceedings and an investigation    regarding competitive activities and other legal, compliance and    regulatory matters, including those involving product and trade    compliance, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act issues and other    matters, could impact us materially.     Our financial results could be materially adversely impacted by    an unfavorable outcome to pending or future litigation and    investigations, including an Australian Competition and Consumer    Commission investigation into industry competitive practices,    lawsuits pertaining to this investigation or to the subject    matter of now concluded investigations by the    U.S. Department of Justice, the European Commission, and    the Competition Law Division of the Department of Justice of    Canada (including purported class actions in the United States    seeking treble damages for alleged unlawful competitive    practices, and a purported class action related to alleged    disclosure and fiduciary duty violations pertaining to alleged    unlawful competitive practices, which were filed after the    announcement of the U.S. Department of Justice    investigation), the impact of potential violations of the    U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act based on issues in    China, and other legal, compliance and regulatory matters,    including product and trade compliance. See Item 1,    Legal Proceedings. There can be no assurance that    any investigation or litigation outcome will be favorable.    6Table of ContentsOur    future results may be affected if we generate less productivity    improvement than projected.     We are undertaking efforts to reduce costs in many of our    operations, including closure of facilities, headcount    reductions, organizational simplification and restructuring,    process standardization, and manufacturing relocation, and using    a variety of tools such as Lean Sigma and Kaizen events, to    increase productivity, which is not assured. Lower levels of    productivity could reduce profitability. In addition, cost    reduction actions could expose us to additional production risk    and loss of sales. As a    manufacturer, our sales and profitability are also dependent    upon the cost and availability of raw materials and energy,    which are subject to price fluctuations, and the ability to    control or pass on costs of raw materials and labor.     Inflationary and other increases in the costs of raw materials,    labor and energy have occurred in the past and are expected to    recur, and our performance depends in part on our ability to    pass on these cost increases to customers in our selling prices    for products, and to effect improvements in productivity. Also,    it is important that we are able to obtain timely delivery of    materials, equipment, and packaging from suppliers, and to make    timely delivery to customers. A disruption to our supply chain    could adversely affect our sales and profitability. Slower    growth in key markets could adversely affect our    profitability.     Our business could be negatively impacted by a decline in key    end use markets or applications for our products. Our overall    performance will be influenced by these markets. Our    customers are widely diversified, but in certain portions of our    business, industry concentration has increased the importance    and decreased the number of significant customers.     In particular, sales of our office and consumer products in the    United States are concentrated in a few major customers,    principally office product superstores, mass market distributors    and wholesalers. The business risk associated with this    concentration, including increased credit risks for these and    other customers, and the possibility of related bad debt    write-offs, could negatively affect our margins and profits. Our    ability to develop and successfully market new products and    applications is important in maintaining growth.     The timely introduction of new products and improvements in    current products helps determine our success. Research and    development for each of our operating segments is complex and    uncertain and requires innovation and anticipation of market    trends. We could focus on products that ultimately are not    accepted by customers or we could suffer delays in production or    launch of new products that could compromise our competitive    position in such product markets. Infringing    intellectual property rights of third parties or inadequately    acquiring or protecting our intellectual property and patents    could harm our ability to compete or grow.     Because our products involve complex technology and chemistry,    we are from time to time involved in litigation involving    patents and other intellectual property. Parties have filed, and    in the future may file, claims against us alleging that we have    infringed their intellectual property rights. If we are held    liable for infringement, we could be required to pay damages or    obtain licenses or to cease making or selling certain products.    There can be no assurance that licenses will be available at    all, or will be available on commercially reasonable terms, and    the cost to defend these claims, whether or not meritorious, or    to develop new technology could be significant and could divert    the attention of management.     We also could have our intellectual property infringed. We    attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual    property and proprietary information, by relying on the patent,    trademark, copyright and trade secret laws of the U.S. and    other countries, as well as on nondisclosure agreements, but it    may be possible for a third party to obtain our information    without our authorization, to independently develop similar    technologies, or to breach non-disclosure agreement entered into    with us. In addition, many of the countries in which we operate    do not have intellectual property laws that protect proprietary    rights as fully as in the U.S. The use of our intellectual    property by someone else without our authorization could reduce    or eliminate certain competitive advantage we have, cause us    7Table of Contents    to lose sales, or otherwise harm our business. Further, the    costs involved to protect our intellectual property rights could    adversely impact our profitability.     We have obtained and applied for some U.S. and foreign    trademark registrations and patents, and will continue to    evaluate whether to register additional trademarks and seek    patents as appropriate. We cannot guarantee that any of the    pending applications will be approved by the applicable    government authorities. Further, we cannot assure that the    validity of our patents or our trademarks will not be    challenged. In addition, third parties might be able to develop    competing products using technology that avoids our patents. The    amount of various taxes we pay is subject to ongoing compliance    requirements and audits by federal, state and foreign tax    authorities.     Our estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues is    subject to our assessment of relevant risks, facts, and    circumstances existing at that time. We use these assessments to    determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and    other tax-related accounts. Our future results may include    favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax    liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved,    which may impact our effective tax rate    and/or our    financial results. We are in the process of reviewing    Paxars compliance with such requirements. We have    deferred tax assets that we may not be able to use under certain    circumstances.     If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in    certain jurisdictions, or if there is a significant change in    the time period within which the underlying temporary    differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required    to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax    assets. This would result in an increase in our effective tax    rate, and an adverse effect on our future operating results. In    addition, changes in statutory tax rates may also change our    deferred tax assets or liability balances, with either favorable    or unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate. Our deferred    tax assets may also be impacted by new legislation or regulation. The level    of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the    actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect    our earnings in future periods. Changes in accounting standards    and government regulations could also affect our pension and    postretirement plan expense and funding requirements.     Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations    and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and other    postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by us in consultation    with outside actuaries. In the event that we determine that    changes are warranted in the assumptions used, such as the    discount rate, expected long term rate of return, or health care    costs, our future pension and projected postretirement benefit    expenses could increase or decrease. Due to changing market    conditions or changes in the participant population, the    actuarial assumptions that we use may differ from actual    results, which could have a significant impact on our pension    and postretirement liability and related costs. Funding    obligations are determined based on the value of assets and    liabilities on a specific date as required under relevant    government regulations for each plan. Future pension funding    requirements, and the timing of funding payments, could be    affected by legislation enacted by the relevant governmental    authorities. In order    for us to remain competitive, it is important to recruit and    retain highly-skilled employees. We also utilize various    outsourcing arrangements for certain services.     There is significant competition to recruit and retain skilled    employees. Due to rapid expansion in certain markets and the    ongoing productivity efforts and recent employee reductions, it    may be difficult for us to retain and recruit sufficient numbers    of highly-skilled employees. We have outsourced certain services    to multiple third-party service providers, and may outsource    other services in the future to achieve cost savings and    efficiencies. Service provider delays, resource availability,    business issues or errors may lead to disruption in our    businesses    and/or    increased costs. If we do not effectively develop, implement and    manage outsourcing strategies, third-party providers do not    perform effectively and timely, or we experience problems with a    transition, we may experience disruption in our businesses, we    may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings, and we may    have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such    service providers.    8Table of ContentsWe need    to comply with many environmental, health, and safety    laws.     Due to the nature of our business, we are subject to    environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations,    including those related to the disposal of hazardous waste from    our manufacturing processes. Compliance with existing and future    environmental, health and safety laws could subject us to future    costs or liabilities; impact our production capabilities;    constrict our ability to sell, expand or acquire facilities; and    generally impact our financial performance. We have accrued    liabilities for environmental    clean-up    sites, including sites for which governmental agencies have    designated us as a potentially responsible party, where it is    probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of    loss can be reasonably estimated. We are in the process of    reviewing the environmental matters related to Paxar. However,    because of the uncertainties associated with environmental    assessment and remediation activities, future expense to    remediate currently identified sites and other sites, which    could be identified in the future for cleanup, could be higher    than the liability currently accrued. In order    to mitigate risk, it is important that we obtain various types    of insurance.     We have various types of insurance including property, workers    compensation and general liability. Insurance costs can be    unpredictable and may adversely impact our financial results. Significant    disruption to our information technology infrastructure could    adversely impact our operations, sales, customer relations, and    financial results.     We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a large    and complex information technology infrastructure to link our    worldwide divisions. Like other information technology systems,    ours is susceptible to damage or interruptions caused by    obsolescence, natural disasters, power failures, viruses and    security breaches. We upgrade and install new systems, which if    installed or programmed incorrectly or if installation is    delayed, could cause significant disruptions. We have    implemented certain measures to reduce our risk related to    system and network disruptions, but if a disruption occurs, we    could incur losses and costs for remediation and interruption of    operations. Additionally, we rely on services provided by    third-party vendors for a significant portion of our information    technology support, development and implementation. Our share    price may be volatile.     Our stock price is influenced by changes in the overall stock    market and demand for equity securities in general. Other    factors, including market expectations for our performance, the    level of perceived growth of our industries, and announcements    concerning industry investigations, have also impacted our share    price. There can be no assurance that our stock price will be    less volatile in the future. If our    credit ratings are downgraded, we may have difficulty obtaining    acceptable short- and long-term financing from capital    markets.     Credit ratings are a significant factor in our ability to raise    short-term and long-term financing. The credit ratings assigned    to us also impact the interest rates on our commercial paper and    other borrowings. If our credit ratings were further downgraded,    our financial flexibility could decrease and the cost to borrow    would increase. Our    reputation, sales, and earnings could be affected adversely if    the quality of our products and services does not meet customer    expectations.     There are occasions when we manufacture products with quality    issues resulting from defective materials, manufacturing,    packaging or design. Many of these issues are discovered before    shipping but this causes delays in shipping, delays in the    manufacturing process, and occasionally cancelled orders. When    the issues are discovered after shipment, this causes additional    shipping costs, possible discounts, possible refunds, and    potential loss of future sales. Both pre-shipping and    post-shipping quality issues can result in financial    consequences along with a negative impact on our reputation.    9Table of ContentsSome of    our products are sold by third parties.     Our products are not only sold by us, but by third party    distributors and retailers as well. Some of our distributors    also market products that compete with our products. Changes in    the financial or business condition or purchasing decisions of    these third parties or their customers could affect our sales    and profitability. We    outsource some of our manufacturing. If there are significant    changes in the quality control or financial or business    condition of these outsourced manufacturers, our business could    be negatively impacted.     We manufacture most of our products, but we also use third-party    manufacturers, for example, for specialty jobs or capacity    overflow. Outsourced manufacturers reduce our ability to prevent    product quality issues, late deliveries, customer    dissatisfaction and compliance with customer requirements for    labor standards. Because of possible quality issues and customer    dissatisfaction, outsourced manufacturers could have an adverse    effect on our business and financial results.     The risks described above are not exclusive. Additional risks    not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be    less significant may also have an adverse effect on us. If any    of the above risks actually occur, our business, results of    operations, cash flows or financial condition could suffer,    which might cause the value of our securities to decline. "

RISK FACTORS     Our ability to attain our goals and objectives is materiallydependent on numerous factors and risks, including but notlimited to, the following:The demand for our products is impacted by economicconditions of the principal countries in which we operate. Adecline in the economies in these countries could have anadverse effect on our sales and profitability.     We have operations in over 40 countries and our domestic andinternational operations are strongly influenced by mattersbeyond our control, including changes in the political, social,economic, tax and regulatory environments (including tariffs) inthe countries in which we operate, as well as the impact ofeconomic conditions on underlying demand for our products. Inaddition, approximately 55% of our sales are in foreigncurrencies, which fluctuate in relation to one another and tothe United States dollar. Fluctuations in currencies can causetransaction, translation and other losses to us, which cannegatively impact our sales and profitability.5Table of ContentsWe operate in some highly competitive markets. If we do notcompete effectively, we could lose market share and experiencefalling prices, adversely affecting our financial results.     We are at risk that our competitors will expand in our keymarkets and implement new technologies making them morecompetitive. There is also the possibility that competitors willbe able to offer additional products, services, lower prices, orother incentives that we cannot or will not offer or that willmake our products less profitable. There can be no assurancethat we will be able to compete successfully against current andfuture competitors.     We are also at risk with regards to changes in customer orderpatterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintainedby customers and the timing of customer purchases, which may beaffected by announced price changes, changes in theCompanys incentive programs, or the customersability to achieve incentive goals. Changes in customerspreferences for our products can also affect the demand for ourproducts.As a manufacturer, our sales and profitability are alsodependent upon the cost and availability of raw materials andenergy, which are subject to price fluctuations, and the abilityto control or pass on costs of raw materials and labor.     Inflationary and other increases in the costs of raw materials,labor and energy have occurred in the past and are expected torecur, and our performance depends in part on our ability topass on to customers changes in costs in our selling prices forproducts and on improvements in productivity. Also, it isimportant that we are able to obtain timely delivery ofmaterials, equipment, and packaging from suppliers. A disruptionto our supply chain could adversely affect our sales andprofitability.Potential adverse developments in legal proceedings andinvestigations regarding competitive activities and other legal,compliance and regulatory matters, including those involvingproduct liability, product and trade compliance, Foreign CorruptPractices Act issues and other matters, could impact usmaterially.     Our financial results could be materially adversely impacted byan unfavorable outcome to pending or future litigation andinvestigations, including, without limitation, any relating tothe Canadian Department of Justice and Australian Competitionand Consumer Commission investigations, into industrycompetitive practices and any related proceedings or lawsuitspertaining to these investigations or to the subject matterthereof (including purported class actions in the United Statesseeking treble damages for alleged unlawful competitivepractices, and a purported class action related to allegeddisclosure and fiduciary duty violations pertaining to allegedunlawful competitive practices, which were filed after theannouncement of the recently closed U.S. Department ofJustice investigation). See Item 3, LegalProceedings. There can be no assurance that anyinvestigation or litigation outcome will be favorable.Our future results may be affected if we generate lessproductivity improvement than projected.     We are undergoing efforts to reduce costs in many of ouroperations, including closure of facilities, headcountreductions, organizational simplification, processstandardization, and using a variety of tools such as Lean Sigmaand Kaizen events, to accomplish this productivity, which is notassured. Lower levels of productivity could result in lowerproduction, sales, and profitability. Cost reduction actions, inturn, could expose us to additional production risk.Slower growth in key markets could adversely affect ourprofitability.     Our business could be negatively impacted by a decline in keyend use markets or applications for our products. Our overallperformance will be influenced by these markets.Our customers are widely diversified, but in certain portionsof our business, industry concentration has increased theimportance and decreased the number of significant customers.     In particular, sales of our office and consumer products in theUnited States are concentrated in a few major customers,principally office product superstores, mass market distributorsand wholesalers. The6Table of Contentsbusiness risk associated with this concentration, includingincreased credit risks for these and other customers, and thepossibility of related bad debtwrite-offs, couldnegatively affect our margins and profits.Our ability to develop and successfully market new productsand applications is important in maintaining growth.     The timely introduction of new products and improvements incurrent products helps determine our success. Research anddevelopment for each of our operating segments is complex anduncertain and requires innovation and anticipation of markettrends. We could focus on products that ultimately are notaccepted by customers.Infringing intellectual property rights of third parties orinadequately acquiring or protecting our intellectual propertyand patents could harm our ability to grow.     Because our products involve complex technology and chemistry,we are sometimes involved in litigation involving patents andother intellectual property. Parties have filed, and in thefuture may file, claims against us alleging that we haveinfringed their intellectual property rights. We could be heldto be liable to pay damages or obtain licenses. There can be noassurance that licenses will be available, or will be availableon commercially reasonable terms, and the cost to defend theseinfringement claims and to develop new technology could besignificant.     We also could have our intellectual property infringed. Weattempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectualproperty and proprietary information, but it may be possible fora third party to obtain our information and develop similartechnologies. In addition, many of the countries in which weoperate have limited or no protection for intellectual propertyrights. The costs involved to protect our intellectual propertyrights could adversely impact our profitability.The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoingaudits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities.     Our estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues issubject to our assessment of relevant risks, facts, andcircumstances existing at that time. We use these assessments todetermine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Ourfuture results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustmentsto our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessmentsare made or resolved, which may impact our effective tax rateand our financial results.We have deferred tax assets that we may not be able to useunder certain circumstances.     If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income incertain jurisdictions, or if there is a significant change inthe time period within which the underlying temporarydifferences become taxable or deductible, we could be requiredto increase our valuation allowances against our deferred taxassets. This would result in an increase in our effective taxrate, and an adverse effect on our future operating results. Inaddition, changes in statutory tax rates may also change ourdeferred tax assets or liability balances, with either favorableor unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate. Our deferredtax assets may also be impacted by new legislation or regulation.The level of returns on pension and postretirement planassets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposescould affect our earnings in future periods.     Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligationsand the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and otherpostretirement benefit plans are evaluated by us in consultationwith outside actuaries. Funding obligations are determined underthe Employee Retirement Income Security Act and are measuredeach year based on the value of assets and liabilities on aspecific date. In the event that we determine that changes arewarranted in the assumptions used, such as the discount rate,expected long term rate of return, or health care costs, ourfuture pension and projected postretirement benefit expensescould increase or decrease. Due to changing market conditions orchanges in the participant population, the actuarial assumptionsthat we use may differ from actual results, which could have asignificant impact on our pension and postretirement7Table of Contentsliability and related costs. Future pension fundingrequirements, and the timing of funding payments, could beaffected by legislation enacted in the U.S. Congress.We have acquired companies and our interest in variousacquisition opportunities has increased. Acquisitions come withsignificant risks and uncertainties, including integration,technology and personnel.     In order to grow our product lines and expand into new markets,we have made acquisitions and may do so in the future. Manyrisks, uncertainties, and costs are associated with theacquisitions. The integration of systems, objectives, personnel,product lines, markets, customers, suppliers, and cost savingscan be difficult to achieve and the results are uncertain. Therecan be no assurance that acquisitions will be successful andcontribute to our profitability.In order for us to remain competitive, it is important torecruit and retain highly-skilled employees.     There is significant competition to recruit and retain skilledemployees. Due to rapid expansion in certain markets and theongoing productivity efforts and recent employee reductions, itmay be difficult for us to retain and recruit sufficient numbersof highly-skilled employees.We need to comply with many environmental, health, and safetylaws.     Due to the nature of our business, we are subject toenvironmental, health, and safety laws and regulations,including those related to the disposal of hazardous waste fromour manufacturing processes. Compliance with existing and futureenvironmental, health and safety laws could subject us to futurecosts or liabilities; impact our production capabilities;constrict our ability to sell, expand or acquire facilities; andgenerally impact our financial performance. We have accruedliabilities for environmentalclean-up sites,including sites for which governmental agencies have designatedus as a potentially responsible party, where it is probable thata loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can bereasonably estimated. However, because of the uncertaintiesassociated with environmental assessment and remediationactivities, future expense to remediate currently identifiedsites and other sites, which could be identified in the futurefor cleanup, could be higher than the liability currentlyaccrued.In order to mitigate risk, it is important that we obtainvarious types of insurance.     We have various types of insurance including health, life, andproperty.
