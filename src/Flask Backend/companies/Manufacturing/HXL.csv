8,HXL,HEXCEL CORP,2024-02-07,"ITEM 1A. Risk Factors
 You should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents we incorporate by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the material risks affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be material that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future, and may require significant management time and attention. You should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk has not already materialized. Risks Related to Our Strategy The markets in which we operate can be cyclical, and downturns in them may adversely affect the results of our operations. Some of the markets in which we operate have been, to varying degrees, cyclical and have experienced downturns. A downturn in these markets could occur at any time as a result of events that are industry specific, such as aircraft production slowdown resulting from the impact of a public health crisis on air travel, the grounding, regulatory scrutiny and/or suspension or discontinuation of aircraft in which our products are used, or other macroeconomic events, such as geopolitical conditions, global conflict, political unrest or terrorist attacks, or an economic downturn or recession. Any deterioration in any of the cyclical markets we serve could adversely affect our financial performance and operating results.During both 2020 and 2021, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Commercial Aerospace, we experienced a material decrease in demand, resulting in order cancellations and deferrals from our Commercial Aerospace customers, which resulted in decreased sales for our Commercial Aerospace products and reduced operating income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. To the extent there are significant deferrals, cancellations, or reductions in demand that result in decreased aircraft build rates, it would have a negative impact on sales for our Commercial Aerospace products and as a result reduce our operating income. Approximately 60% of our sales for 2023 were derived from sales to the Commercial Aerospace industry. Reductions in demand for commercial aircraft or a delay in deliveries could result from many factors, including delays in the startup or ramp-up of new programs, suspension or discontinuation of current commercial aircraft programs, changes in the propensity for the general public to travel by air (including as a result of terrorist events and any subsequent military response, a public health crisis or a global conflict), a significant change in the cost of aviation fuel, a change in technology resulting in the use of alternative materials, environmental concerns (including climate change), consolidation and liquidation of airlines, availability of funding for new aircraft purchases or leases, inventory corrections or disruptions throughout the supply chain and slower macroeconomic growth. At different times, both Airbus and Boeing have experienced various delays in the start and ramp up of several aircraft programs. In the past, these have delayed our expected growth, or our effective utilization of capacity installed for such growth. Future delays, or production cuts arising from the impact of macroeconomic events, geopolitical conditions, global conflict or supply chain and labor disruptions, in these or other major new customer programs could similarly impact our results.In addition, our customers continue to emphasize the need for cost reduction or other improvements in contract terms throughout the supply chain. In response to these pressures, we may be required to accept increased risk or face the prospects of margin compression on some products in the future. Where possible, we seek to offset or mitigate the impact of such pressures through productivity and performance improvements, cost index contractual provisions, hedging and other actions, which may not be successful.A significant decline in business with Airbus, Boeing, or other significant customers could materially impact our business, operating results, prospects, and financial condition. We have concentrated customers in the Commercial Aerospace and the Space & Defense markets. In the Commercial Aerospace market, approximately 79%, and in the Space & Defense market, approximately 20%, of our 2023 sales were made to Airbus and Boeing and their related subcontractors. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, approximately 39% and 38% of our total consolidated sales, respectively, were to Airbus, and its related subcontractors and approximately 15% and 14% of our total consolidated sales, respectively, were to Boeing and its related subcontractors. Significant changes in the demand for our customers’ end products, program delays, the share of their requirements that is awarded to us or changes in the design or materials used to construct their products could result in a significant loss of business with these customers. The loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by Airbus or Boeing or any of our other significant customers could materially impair our business, operating results, 14 prospects and financial condition. The level of purchases and product mix demanded by our customers is often affected by events beyond their control, including general economic conditions, demand for their products, conditions in the airline industry, regulatory scrutiny and/or suspension or discontinuation of aircraft, disruptions in deliveries, business disruptions, strikes and other factors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.Reductions in space and defense spending could result in a decline in our sales. Space and defense production that has occurred in recent years may not be sustained, individual programs important to Hexcel may be cancelled, production may not continue to grow or may decrease and the increased demand for composite-intensive programs may not continue. In addition, the production of military aircraft depends upon defense budgets and the related demand for defense and related equipment. Approximately 30% of our sales in 2023 were to the Space & Defense market, of which approximately 80% were related to military programs in the United States and other countries. In addition to normal business risks, our indirect supply of products to the U.S. government is subject to unique risks largely beyond our control. The level of U.S. defense spending is hard to predict, and U.S. Department of Defense budgets could be negatively impacted by several factors, including, but not limited to, a change in defense spending policy as a result of the current political environment or otherwise, military aid to countries experiencing global conflict, the U.S. government’s budget deficits or breach of the debt ceiling, other spending priorities, increased defense regulatory requirements resulting in additional expenses, the cost of sustaining the U.S. military presence internationally, potential political pressure to reduce military spending and future potential government shutdowns, each of which could cause the U.S. Department of Defense budget to remain unchanged or to decline.If we fail to comply with government procurement laws and regulations, including those related to information security, we could lose business and be liable for various penalties or sanctions.  We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. government contracts, including government security requirements and additional government export control laws and regulations, as well as certain cybersecurity certifications and other cybersecurity requirements. These regulations and other requirements regularly evolve, and new laws, regulations or procurement requirements or changes to current ones (including, for example, regulations related to cybersecurity, privacy, information classification and protection, greenhouse gas emissions and climate risk, cost accounting, recovery of employee compensation costs, counterfeit parts, pensions, anti-human trafficking, specialty metals, conflict minerals and use of certain non-U.S. equipment and materials) could significantly increase our costs and risks and reduce our profitability. In complying with these laws and regulations, we may incur significant costs, and non-compliance may result in the imposition of fines and penalties, including contractual damages. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or if a government audit, review, or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil penalties, criminal penalties, or administrative sanctions or suspension or debarment from contracting with the U.S. government. In addition, failure to follow the requirements of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual or any other applicable U.S. government industrial security regulations could, among other things, result in termination of any facility security clearance, which in turn would preclude us from being awarded classified contracts or, under certain circumstances, performing on our existing classified contracts. If we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis, it could adversely affect our business and prospects. We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop, on a timely basis, technologically advanced products that meet or exceed current industry standards, including developing products with an improved environmental footprint that continue to contribute to the environmental sustainability goals of our customers.  Although we believe we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors, maintaining such advantages will require us to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses.Acquisitions, divestitures, mergers, business combinations or joint ventures may entail certain operational and financial risks. Over the past several years, we have completed strategic acquisitions of complementary manufacturing companies, as well as strategic investments in companies and divestitures of certain interests. We expect to continue to explore complementary mergers, acquisitions, investments and joint ventures and may also pursue additional divestures or closures of business lines or investments that do not fit with our core strategy. We may also engage in further vertical integration and business restructuring. We may face competition for attractive targets and may not be able to acquire potential targets on terms or at prices acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, these types of transactions may require significant liquidity, which may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.We cannot provide any assurance that we will realize the intended benefits from any such transactions. The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations. Even if successfully integrated, the acquired business may not achieve the results we expect or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned. In addition, we may not be able to successfully complete any strategic divestures in a timely manner, or at all. 15  Risks Related to Our OperationsThe global macroeconomic environment could negatively impact our business and our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by the global macroeconomic environment, which has experienced, and continues to experience, extraordinary challenges, including high rates of inflation; increasing interest rates; widespread disruptions in supply chains; workforce challenges, including labor shortages; and market volatility. These challenges have, among other things, led to increased costs, labor and supply shortages, and transportation and performance delays and disruptions and have adversely affected us, our industry, our customers and suppliers and others with whom we do business. We (including our suppliers and other partners) have and may continue to experience inflationary pressures, supply chain disruption and labor, material and transportation cost increases at a rate higher than anticipated. Given the nature of our business and our contracts (many of which are fixed price and of long duration), we may be unable to recover some of these increased costs or to offset such costs with greater than expected efficiencies. While some aspects of the macroeconomic environment appear to be improving, and we have been able to mitigate some of the challenges, other challenges persist. We cannot predict how long these challenges will persist or how they will change over time, or how the macroeconomic environment will evolve and continue to impact us. While we continue to work proactively to mitigate these challenges, if we are unable to do so successfully, our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Our results of operations would be adversely affected by a shortage of trained personnel or work stoppages, and may be adversely affected by increasing labor costs.  Our business has historically been dependent on a highly trained workforce because of the complex nature of our products. As of December 31, 2023, approximately  30% of employees in the United States were unionized and the majority in Europe were represented by a works council. We periodically need to renegotiate our collective bargaining and works council agreements, and any failure to negotiate new agreements or extensions in a timely manner could result in work stoppages or slowdowns. Our ability to hire, train, assimilate and retain a qualified workforce has also been impacted by the ongoing labor market disruptions. If we are unable to hire and retain a sufficient number of trained personnel, or we experience a significant or prolonged work stoppage in such an environment, including due to salary negotiation challenges with employees covered by collective bargaining or works council agreements, our ability to secure new business and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In 2022 and 2023, in addition to labor shortages, we also experienced increases in labor costs in the countries in which we operate due to rising inflation rates and localized labor market disruptions. Further increases in labor costs could significantly reduce our profit margins if we are unable to flow such costs through to our customers.Our ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital to our success. Our success, competitiveness and ability to execute on our global strategies and maintain a culture of innovation depend in large part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees and leaders with expertise and capabilities, representing diverse backgrounds and experiences. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, such as the impact of inflation, management changes, increasing local and global competition for talent, particularly due to the increase in remote working opportunities, the availability of qualified employees, restructuring and alignment activities (including workforce reductions), and the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs. If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees and leaders, we may be unable to fully capitalize on current and new market opportunities, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations. The loss or retirement of employees presents particular challenges to the extent they involve the departure of knowledgeable and experienced employees and the resulting need to identify and train existing or new candidates to perform necessary functions, and ineffective succession planning could result in unexpected costs, reduced productivity, and/or difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls. There is also the risk that we are unable to achieve our diversity, equity and inclusion objectives or, more broadly, to meet diversity or other sustainability goals increasingly required by our stockholders, customers, employees and other stakeholders. If we are unable to attract and retain a qualified and diverse workforce, we may be unable to maintain our competitive position and our future success could be materially adversely affected. We have engaged in restructuring and alignment activities from time to time and there can be no assurance that our efforts will have the intended effects. From time to time, we have responded to changes in our industry and the markets we serve, or other changes in our business, by restructuring or aligning our operations, including the closure of our Windsor, Colorado and Tianjin, China wind energy prepreg production facilities in 2020 and 2022, respectively, and the movement of our Research and Technology Center from Dublin, California to Salt Lake City, Utah. Due to necessary cost reduction measures or changes in the industry and markets in which we 16 compete, we may decide to implement additional restructuring or alignment activities in the future, such as closing plants, idling certain equipment or operations, or making additions, reductions or other changes to our management or workforce. These restructuring and/or alignment activities generally result in charges and expenditures that may adversely affect our financial results for one or more periods. Restructuring and/or alignment activities can also create unanticipated consequences, such as instability or distraction among our workforce, and we cannot provide any assurance that any restructuring or alignment efforts that we undertake will result in the intended benefits. A variety of risks could cause us not to realize expected cost savings, including, among others: (a) higher than expected severance costs related to headcount reductions; (b) higher than expected costs of closing plants; (c) incurring costs to hire new employees or delays or difficulty hiring the employees needed; and (d) delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to our cost-saving plan. If we are unable to align our operations in light of evolving market conditions, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.A decrease in supply, interruptions at key facilities or an increase in cost of raw materials could result in a material decline in our profitability. Our profitability depends largely on the price and continuity of the supply of raw materials, which may be supplied through a sole source or a limited number of sources. We purchase large volumes of raw materials, such as epoxy and phenolic resins, acrylonitrile, carbon fiber, fiberglass yarn, aramid paper and, to a lesser extent, aluminum foil.  Any restrictions on supply resulting from geopolitical conditions, extreme weather events, availability of global logistics, increase in the cost of our raw materials including increases resulting from inflation or tariffs, or other unforeseen disruptions in the supply chain could significantly reduce our profit margins. Efforts to mitigate restrictions on the supply or price increases of these raw materials through long-term purchase agreements, productivity improvements, multi-source qualifications, use of alternative materials, hedging or flowing through cost increases to our customers may not be successful. In addition, increasing prices of our products could put such products at a competitive disadvantage. During recent years, as a result of the challenges created by global supply and transportation constraints, ongoing global conflict, the COVID-19 pandemic and market volatility, we experienced supply disruptions and cost increases and anticipate that the risk of supply disruptions and material shortages, as well as cost increases, may continue. While we have not experienced materially significant issues in the purchase of key raw materials, we continue to monitor the availability (including transportation) and price of raw materials on a regular basis, as well as any potential impact on our operations.The occurrence of material operational problems or interruptions, including, but not limited to, as a result of the failure of key equipment, a quality or financial failure of a sole source or major supplier, the effects of natural disasters or climate change-related events, the impact of any public health crises, ongoing supply chain disruptions and supply shortages, energy disruption caused by ongoing global conflict, the inability to install, staff and/or qualify necessary capacity, political or social unrest, the failure to achieve planned manufacturing improvements or other causes, or any other inability to meet customer requirements, may have a material adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility, and could have a material effect on the Company as a whole.We have substantial international operations subject to uncertainties that could affect our operating results. We believe that revenue from sales outside the U.S. will continue to account for a material portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future. In 2023, 50% of our production and 59% of our customer sales occurred outside of the United States. Additionally, we have invested significant resources in our international operations, and we intend to continue to make such investments in the future. Our business and results of operations are subject to numerous risks of doing business internationally including: (a) general economic, political, legal, social and health conditions unfavorable to our growth strategy, including the impact of rising inflation and other global economic conditions on labor and supply costs and availability, changes in currency exchange rates, geopolitical conditions and global conflicts; (b) longer payment cycles of foreign customers or challenges in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems; (c) the cost of compliance with international trade laws of all of the countries in which we do business, including export control laws, relating to sales and purchases of goods and equipment and transfers of technology; (d) government actions having a direct or indirect adverse impact on our international business and market opportunities, including, but not limited to, tariffs and other trade restrictions imposed by the United States, China and other jurisdictions; (e) adverse tax consequences, such as fluctuating tax rates, withholding requirements on foreign earnings or limitations on repatriations of earnings; and (f) the potential difficulty in enforcing our intellectual property rights in certain foreign countries, and the potential for the intellectual property rights of others to affect our ability to sell products in certain markets. Any one of these could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. With respect to tariffs, implementation of new tariff schemes by various governments, such as those implemented by the United States and China in recent years, could potentially increase the costs of our materials, increase our cost of production, and ultimately increase the landed cost of our products sold from one country into another country. In addition, although we are not experiencing direct material adverse effects on our business resulting from ongoing global conflicts, the global implications, including increased inflation, escalating energy costs, and constrained raw material availability, and thus increasing costs, as well as embargos on flights from certain countries, are impacting the global economy and the aerospace industry in particular.17 Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may influence the profitability and cash flows of our business. For example, most of our European operations sell a majority of the products they produce in U.S. dollars, yet the labor and overhead costs and portions of raw material costs incurred in the manufacture of those products are primarily denominated in Euros, British pound sterling or U.S. dollars. As a result, the local currency margins of goods manufactured with costs denominated in local currency, yet sold in U.S. dollars, will vary with fluctuations in currency exchange rates, reducing when the U.S. dollar weakens against the Euro and British pound sterling. In addition, the reported U.S. dollar value of the local currency financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries will vary with fluctuations in currency exchange rates. While we enter into currency hedge agreements in an attempt to mitigate these types of fluctuations, we cannot remove all fluctuations or hedge all exposures, or we may not be successful in hedging our exposure, and our earnings are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates.We currently do not have political risk insurance in the countries in which we conduct business. While we carefully consider these risks when evaluating our international operations, we cannot provide assurance that we will not be materially adversely affected as a result of such risks.We could be adversely affected by environmental and safety requirements, as well as legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change. Our operations require the handling, use, storage, transport and disposal of certain regulated materials and wastes. As a result, we are subject to various laws and regulations pertaining to pollution and protection of the environment, health, and safety. These requirements govern, among other things, emissions to air, discharge to waters, the generation, handling, storage, transport, treatment and disposal of regulated materials and waste, and remediation of contaminated sites. We have made, and will continue to make, capital and other expenditures in order to comply with these laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become more stringent in the future.In some cases, regulatory bodies have decided and may decide in the future to limit or ban certain materials we use in our manufacturing process due to potentially significant health and safety risks to people or the environment.  Such limitations or bans have resulted in, and may in the future require us to consider, the use of alternative raw materials or changes to our method of operations.  Such alternatives often require customer approval and may result in additional costs, including higher raw material expenses, changes in operational methods, and additional customer qualifications. The formulation changes could also impact the utility of our products.We have been named as a “potentially responsible party” under Superfund or similar state laws at certain former and current sites requiring clean up. These laws generally impose liability for costs to investigate and remediate contamination without regard to fault. Under certain circumstances, liability may be joint and several, resulting in one responsible party being held responsible for the entire cleanup obligation. Liability may also include damages to natural resources. We have incurred and likely will continue to incur expenses to investigate and clean up certain of our existing and former facilities, for which we believe we have adequate reserves. The ongoing operation of our manufacturing plants also entails environmental risks, and we may incur material costs or liabilities in the future that could adversely affect us. Although most of our properties have been the subject of environmental site assessments, there can be no assurance that all potential instances of soil and groundwater contamination have been identified, even at those sites where assessments have been conducted. Accordingly, we may discover previously unknown environmental conditions and the cost of remediating such conditions may be material. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We may also be required to comply with evolving environmental, health and safety laws, regulations or requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future or to address newly discovered information or conditions that require a response. As our business expands to meet customer and market demands, and community growth impacts local ambient air and water limits, additional controls are anticipated to be required.In addition, concerns about the relationship between greenhouse gases and global climate change, and an increased focus on carbon neutrality, has resulted, and may continue to result, in additional regulations at the national and international level to monitor, regulate, control and tax emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. A number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative or regulatory changes in response to climate change, including regulating greenhouse gas emissions. The continued lack of consistent climate legislation creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. The outcome of new legislation or regulation in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate has resulted in, and may in the future result in, new or additional requirements, including mandatory disclosure requirements, and fees or restrictions on certain activities. Our manufacturing plants use energy, including electricity and natural gas, and some of our plants emit amounts of greenhouse gases that may in the future be affected by these legislative and regulatory efforts. Compliance with greenhouse gas and climate change initiatives has resulted, and may in the future result in, additional costs to us, including increased energy, transportation and raw material costs, additional taxes, 18 reduced emission allowances or additional restrictions on production or operations. We expect we will be required to make additional investments in our facilities and equipment, change our manufacturing processes, obtain substitute materials, which may cost more or be less available or harder to source, fund offset projects, or undertake other costly activities. In addition, failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in fines or government investigations or actions, which could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We could also face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change.In addition to compliance obligations related to climate change, growing customer environmental and sustainability requirements, including procurement policies that include social and emissions reduction or other environmental standards and requirements that suppliers are required comply with, as well as sustainability goals and targets that we have adopted, could cause us to alter our manufacturing, operations or equipment processes, and incur substantial expense to meet these requirements. We are actively reviewing and implementing projects to reduce our energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions, but there is no guarantee that such options or projects will be technologically and/or environmentally feasible, or that we will be able to implement any such projects on a timely or cost-effective basis. The failure to comply with customer environmental or sustainability requirements, or similar types of requests, could adversely affect our relationships with such customers, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, our reputation could be damaged if we or others in our industry do not act, or are perceived not to act, responsibly with respect to our impact on the environment, or if we fail to achieve our sustainability goals or targets, which could limit our ability to grow and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations. Our business and operations may be adversely affected by cybersecurity breaches or other information technology system or network intrusions.  We depend heavily on information technology and computerized systems to communicate and operate effectively. We store sensitive data, including proprietary business information, intellectual property, regulated data (U.S. government and other), customer data and confidential employee or other personal data, in our systems. In addition to internal information technology systems, we leverage cloud-based systems, where data is stored and exchanged with external third-party vendors. From time to time, we experience attempted cyberattacks on our information technology systems, either directly or indirectly via our supply chain or third-party vendors, which are becoming more sophisticated and could have a material impact on us. These cyberattacks, which could be related to industrial or foreign government espionage, activism, or financial motivations, continue to evolve and become more sophisticated and include attempting to covertly introduce malware to our systems, performing reconnaissance, phishing and other means of social engineering, impersonating authorized users, and stealing, corrupting, restricting our access to data or otherwise compromising the integrity, confidentiality, and/or availability of our systems hardware and networks and the information on them, among other activities. To the extent artificial intelligence capabilities improve and are increasingly adopted, they may be used to identify vulnerabilities and craft increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity attacks, and vulnerabilities may be introduced from the use of artificial intelligence by us, our customers, suppliers and other business partners and third-party providers. We continue to update our infrastructure, security tools, planning, employee training and processes to protect against cybersecurity incidents, including both external and internal threats, and to prevent their occurrence or recurrence. We have implemented various measures, including technical security controls, employee training, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems, maintenance of backup systems and the use of disaster recovery capability. While Company personnel have been tasked to detect and investigate any security incidents, we cannot guarantee that such measures will be effective or sufficient to prevent a cyberattack, and future cyberattacks could still occur and could go undetected and persist for an extended period of time. Such cyberattacks could lead to data corruption or loss of data and exposure of proprietary and confidential information, disruptions in or damage to critical systems, production downtimes or operational delays, and theft of data, funds, or intellectual property, and we may be unable to mitigate potential consequences of these attacks. In addition, we face information technology security and fraud risks due to increased remote work, which may create additional information security vulnerabilities and/or magnify the impact of any disruption in our information technology systems. The unauthorized use of our confidential or proprietary business information could harm our competitive position and reputation, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, cause us to breach contractual commitments to our customers or other third parties, or otherwise adversely affect our business. Our customers, partners, suppliers and subcontractors and others to whom we entrust confidential data, and on whom we rely to provide products and services, face similar threats and growing requirements, including ones for which others may seek to hold us responsible. We depend on such parties to implement adequate controls and safeguards to protect against and report cyber incidents. If such parties fail to deter, detect or report cyber incidents in a timely manner, we may suffer from financial and other harm, including to our information, operations, financial results, performance, employees and reputation. 19 An intrusion may also result in fines, penalties, litigation or governmental investigations and proceedings, increased mitigation and remediation expenses, diminished competitive advantages through reputational damages and increased operational costs. Further, cybersecurity and data protection laws and regulations continue to evolve, and are increasingly demanding, both in the U.S. and globally, which adds compliance complexity and may increase our costs of compliance and expose us to litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions or fines in one or more jurisdictions. Additionally, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, costs to comply with increased cybersecurity protections and standards of our customers, including the U.S. government. While we carry cybersecurity insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. We operate our business in regions subject to natural disasters and other severe weather events and any disruption to our business resulting from such events could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. We operate, and rely on suppliers who operate, in regions subject to natural disasters and other severe weather events. Extreme weather events and changing weather patterns present physical risks on existing infrastructure that may become more frequent or more severe as a result of factors related to climate change. In addition, the impacts of climate change on global water resources may result in water scarcity, which could in the future impact our ability to access sufficient quantities of water in certain locations and result in increased costs. We have in the past and will continue in the future to assess potential manufacturing and operational risks related to climate change, including risk of exposure to rising sea levels and significant rainfall, flooding, wildfire, drought, earthquake, hurricane or tornado events within our supply chain. We previously determined that a small percentage of our suppliers manufacture in vulnerable locations, which may impact distribution of raw materials to our operations, although we have taken actions to mitigate the potential impact where possible. We also have two sites in the southeast United States, a region vulnerable to severe weather events (i.e., hurricanes, tornadoes and floods), that are associated with excess warming. Although preventative measures may help to mitigate damage, such measures could be costly, and any disaster could adversely affect our ability to conduct business, including disrupting our supply of raw materials, damaging our manufacturing facilities or otherwise affecting production, transportation and delivery of our products, or affect demand for our products, and the insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from any business interruption resulting from a natural disaster or other severe weather events. Further, recurring extreme weather events could reduce the availability or increase the cost of insurance. Any future disruptions to our operations as a result of a natural disaster or severe weather event could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Our business could be negatively impacted by sustainability/environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters and/or our reporting of such matters.      There is an increasing focus from certain investors, customers, employees, and other stakeholders concerning sustainability/ESG matters, and an increasing number of investors are requiring companies to disclose sustainability/ESG policies, practices and metrics. Our customers may require us to implement sustainability/ESG responsibility procedures or standards before they continue to do business with us. In addition, some investors use ESG criteria to guide their investment strategies, and may not invest in us, or divest their holdings of us, if they believe our policies relating to ESG matters are inadequate or, on the other hand, have a negative response to such policies as a result of anti-ESG sentiment. Additionally, we may face reputational challenges in the event that our sustainability/ESG policies, practices and metrics do not meet the standards set by certain constituencies, which are often inconsistent in approach.      In addition, from time to time, we communicate certain initiatives, targets or goals regarding sustainability/ESG matters. Although we intend to meet these commitments, we may be required to expend significant resources to do so, which could increase our operational costs. Further, there can be no assurance of the extent to which any of our commitments will be achieved, if at all; we could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of such initiatives, targets or goals, or we could fail in fully and accurately reporting our progress on such initiatives, targets and goals. In addition, we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives, targets or goals or perceived as not acting responsibly in connection with these matters. Any such matters could have a material adverse effect on our business.Risks Related to Our Common StockWe cannot make any guarantees with respect to payment of dividends on, or repurchases of, our common stock. We currently pay quarterly dividends; however, our board of directors regularly evaluates our capital allocation strategy and dividend policy, and any future determination to pay, maintain or increase cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon, among other factors, our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements and 20 contractual or legal restrictions, including the requirements of our revolving credit facility and other financing agreements to which we may be a party. No assurance can be given that cash dividends will continue to be declared and paid at historical levels or at all.  Our share repurchase program does not have an expiration date, and we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares, on any particular timetable or at all. There can be no assurance that we will repurchase stock at favorable prices. We resumed repurchases under our share repurchase program in the third quarter of 2023, following suspension of repurchases in April 2020; however, the repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time and, even if fully implemented, may not enhance long-term stockholder value.  Our amended and restated bylaws (the “bylaws”) provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for certain legal actions between us and our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against the Company and our directors and officers.  Our bylaws provide to the fullest extent permitted by law that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) or our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended (the “certificate of incorporation”), or bylaws, or any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the State of Delaware.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, this exclusive forum provision applies to state and federal law claims, including claims under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""), although the Company will not be deemed to have waived its compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ organizational documents has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with claims arising under federal securities laws or otherwise, a court could find the exclusive forum provision contained in the bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable.  This exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with the Company or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against the Company and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, and the DGCL have anti-takeover effects and could delay, discourage, defer or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider to be in the stockholders’ best interests.  Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the DGCL may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our board of directors determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Such provisions include, among other things, those that: •prohibit stockholders from taking action by written consent and do not permit stockholders to call a special meeting;•authorize the board of directors, without further action by the stockholders, to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series, and with respect to each series, to fix the number of shares constituting that series, and establish the rights and terms of that series;•establish advance notice procedures for stockholders to submit proposals and nominations of candidates for election to the board of directors to be brought before a stockholders meeting;•allow our directors to establish the size of the board of directors (so long as the board of directors consists of at least three and no more than fifteen directors) and fill vacancies on the board of directors created by an increase in the number of directors (subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock to elect additional directors under specified circumstances);•do not provide stockholders cumulative voting rights with respect to director elections; •provide that the bylaws may be amended by the board of directors without stockholder approval, to the extent permitted by law; and•do not opt out of Section 203 of the DGCL, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in a “business combination” with any interested stockholder (generally speaking, a stockholder who holds 15% or more 21 of our voting stock) for three years from the date such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless certain conditions are met.       These provisions may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in the Company’s control or change in the board of directors or management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares of common stock or transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests. Accordingly, these provisions could adversely affect the price of our common stock. "
9,HXL,HEXCEL CORP,2023-02-08,"ITEM 1A. Risk Factors
 You should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents we incorporate by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the material risks affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be material that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future, and may require significant management time and attention. You should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk has not already materialized. Risks Related to Our Strategy The markets in which we operate can be cyclical, and downturns in them may adversely affect the results of our operations. Some of the markets in which we operate have been, to varying degrees, cyclical and have experienced downturns. A downturn in these markets could occur at any time as a result of events that are industry specific, such as aircraft production slowdown resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on air travel, the grounding and/or regulatory scrutiny of the Boeing 737 MAX and the Boeing 787, or macroeconomic events, such as an economic downturn or recession. Any deterioration in any of the cyclical markets we serve could adversely affect our financial performance and operating results, as occurred during 2020 and 2021 with respect to the Commercial Aerospace industry.During both 2020 and 2021, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Commercial Aerospace, we experienced a material decrease in demand, resulting in order cancellations and deferrals from our Commercial Aerospace customers, which resulted in decreased sales for our Commercial Aerospace products and reduced operating income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. To the extent there are any further significant deferrals, cancellations, or reductions in demand results in decreased aircraft build rates, including as a result of the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it would have a further negative impact on sales for our Commercial Aerospace products and as a result reduce our operating income.  Approximately 58% of our sales for 2022 were derived from sales to the Commercial Aerospace industry. Reductions in demand for commercial aircraft or a delay in deliveries could result from many factors, including delays in the startup or ramp-up of new programs, suspension or discontinuation of current commercial aircraft programs, changes in the propensity for the general public to travel by air (including as a result of terrorist events and any subsequent military response, a public health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or a global conflict, such as the Russia/Ukraine conflict), a significant change in the cost of aviation fuel, a change in technology resulting in the use of alternative materials, environmental concerns (including climate change), consolidation and liquidation of airlines, availability of funding for new aircraft purchases or leases, inventory corrections or disruptions throughout the supply chain and slower macroeconomic growth. At different times, both Airbus and Boeing have experienced various delays in the start and ramp up of several aircraft programs. In the past, these have delayed our expected growth, or our effective utilization of capacity installed for such growth. Future delays, or production cuts arising from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, any future public health crisis or other macroeconomic event in these or other major new customer programs could similarly impact our results.In addition, our customers continue to emphasize the need for cost reduction or other improvements in contract terms throughout the supply chain. In response to these pressures, we may be required to accept increased risk or face the prospects of margin compression on some products in the future. Where possible, we seek to offset or mitigate the impact of such pressures through productivity and performance improvements, cost index contractual provisions, hedging and other actions, which may not be successful.15 A significant decline in business with Airbus, Boeing, or other significant customers could materially impact our business, operating results, prospects, and financial condition. We have concentrated customers in the Commercial Aerospace and the Space & Defense markets. In the Commercial Aerospace market, approximately 79%, and in the Space & Defense market, approximately 21%, of our 2022 sales were made to Airbus and Boeing and their related subcontractors. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, approximately 38% and 33% of our total consolidated sales, respectively, were to Airbus, and its related subcontractors and approximately 14% and 16% of our total consolidated sales, respectively, were to Boeing and its related subcontractors. Significant changes in the demand for our customers’ end products, program delays, the share of their requirements that is awarded to us or changes in the design or materials used to construct their products could result in a significant loss of business with these customers. The loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by Airbus or Boeing or any of our other significant customers could materially impair our business, operating results, prospects and financial condition. The level of purchases and product mix demanded by our customers is often affected by events beyond their control, including general economic conditions, demand for their products, conditions in the airline industry, disruptions in deliveries, business disruptions, strikes and other factors, including the previous grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX by the Federal Aviation Administration and other regulators and the regulatory scrutiny of the Boeing 787 causing production delays, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on air travel and general economic conditions. Further delays in the production ramp-up of the Boeing 737 MAX or the Boeing 787, and the continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.Reductions in space and defense spending could result in a decline in our sales. Space and defense production that has occurred in recent years may not be sustained, individual programs important to Hexcel may be cancelled, production may not continue to grow and the increased demand for composite-intensive programs may not continue. In addition, the production of military aircraft depends upon defense budgets and the related demand for defense and related equipment. Approximately 29% of our sales in 2022 were to the Space & Defense market, of which approximately 78% were related to military programs in the United States and other countries. In addition to normal business risks, our indirect supply of products to the U.S. government is subject to unique risks largely beyond our control. U.S. Department of Defense budgets could be negatively impacted by several factors, including, but not limited to, a change in defense spending policy as a result of the current political environment or otherwise, military aid to Ukraine, the U.S. government’s budget deficits, other spending priorities, increased defense regulatory requirements resulting in additional expenses, the cost of sustaining the U.S. military presence internationally and possible political pressure to reduce military spending, each of which could cause the U.S. Department of Defense budget to remain unchanged or to decline.If we fail to comply with government procurement, including information security, laws and regulations, we could lose business and be liable for various penalties or sanctions.   We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. government contracts, including the government security requirements and additional government export control laws and regulations, as well as certain cybersecurity certifications and other cybersecurity requirements. These regulations and other requirements regularly evolve, and new laws, regulations or procurement requirements or changes to current ones (including, for example, regulations related to cybersecurity, privacy, information classification and protection, greenhouse gas emissions and climate risk, cost accounting, recovery of employee compensation costs, counterfeit parts, pensions, anti-human trafficking, specialty metals, conflict minerals and use of certain non-U.S. equipment and materials) could significantly increase our costs and risks and reduce our profitability. In complying with these laws and regulations, we may incur significant costs, and non-compliance may result in the imposition of fines and penalties, including contractual damages. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or if a government audit, review, or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil penalties, criminal penalties, or administrative sanctions or suspension or debarment from contracting with the U.S. government.  In addition, failure to follow the requirements of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual or any other applicable U.S. government industrial security regulations could, among other things, result in termination of any facility security clearance, which in turn would preclude us from being awarded classified contracts or, under certain circumstances, performing on our existing classified contracts. If we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis, it could adversely affect our business and prospects. We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop, on a timely basis, technologically advanced products that meet or exceed current industry standards, including developing products with an improved environmental footprint that continue to contribute to the environmental sustainability goals of our customers.  Although we believe we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors, maintaining such advantages will require us to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses.Acquisitions, divestitures, mergers, business combinations or joint ventures may entail certain operational and financial risks. 16 Over the past several years, we have completed strategic acquisitions of complementary manufacturing companies, as well as strategic investments in companies. We expect to continue to explore complementary mergers, acquisitions, investments and joint ventures and may also pursue divestures or closures of business lines or investments that do not fit with our core strategy. We may also engage in further vertical integration. We may face competition for attractive targets and may not be able to acquire potential targets on terms or at prices acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, these types of transactions may require significant liquidity, which may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.We cannot provide any assurance that we will realize the intended benefits from any such transactions. The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations. Even if successfully integrated, the acquired business may not achieve the results we expect or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned. In addition, we may not be able to successfully complete any strategic divestures in a timely manner, or at all.   Risks Related to Our OperationsOur business has been and may continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic created significant uncertainty and economic disruption and has negatively affected, and may continue to negatively affect, the business and results of operations of the Company.  The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic caused (a) disruption to our global manufacturing operations as a result of government and other regulatory requirements and restrictions and the health and availability of onsite personnel; (b) significant reductions in demand for commercial aircraft and therefore our products, as a result of travel restrictions and a decrease in the propensity for air travel; (c) global supply chain disruptions resulting in shortages in necessary raw materials and cost inflation; and (d) market volatility, resulting in a significant decline in our stock price and impacting our ability to declare dividends, conduct share buybacks, and comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness resulting in amendments to ensure continued compliance. There is no guarantee our efforts to mitigate the adverse impacts of COVID-19 will be effective or that such impacts will not recur.We cannot predict at this time the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will adversely impact our business, results, and financial condition, which will depend on many factors that are currently not known. These include, among others, (i) the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic; (ii) the continued effectiveness of the actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact; (iii) the extent of further disruption to the manufacturing of and demand for our products and our ability to adjust our production schedules to align with changing demand; (iv) the effectiveness of our past and any potential future restructuring actions; and (v) the extent to which global economic and operating conditions, including air travel and business spending, return to their pre-pandemic levels. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may experience an impact to our business as a result of any economic downturn that has occurred or may occur in the future.In addition to the foregoing, many of the risk factors disclosed herein have been, and we anticipate may continue to be further, heightened or exacerbated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results of operations would be adversely affected by a shortage of trained personnel or work stoppages, and may be adversely affected by increasing labor costs.  Our business has historically been dependent on a highly trained workforce because of the complex nature of our products. Furthermore, as of December 31, 2022, approximately 22% of employees in the United States were unionized and the majority in Europe were represented by a works’ council.  We periodically need to renegotiate our collective bargaining and works’ council agreements, and any failure to negotiate new agreements or extensions in a timely manner could result in work stoppages or slowdowns.  Our ability to hire, train, assimilate and retain a qualified workforce has also been impacted by the ongoing labor market disruptions.  If we are unable to hire and retain a sufficient number of trained personnel, or we experience a significant or prolonged work stoppage in such an environment, including due to salary negotiation challenges with employees covered by collective bargaining or works’ council agreements, our ability to secure new business and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  In 2022, in addition to labor shortages, we also experienced an increase in labor costs in the countries in which we operate due to rising inflation rates and localized labor market disruptions.  Further increases in labor costs could significantly reduce our profit margins if we are unable to flow such costs through to our customers.Our ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital to our success. Our success, competitiveness and ability to execute on our global strategies and maintain a culture of innovation depend in large part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees and leaders with expertise and capabilities, representing diverse backgrounds and experiences. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global 17 economic and industry conditions, management changes, increasing local and global competition for talent, particularly due to the increase in remote working opportunities resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the availability of qualified employees, restructuring and alignment activities (including workforce reductions), and the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs. If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees and leaders, we may be unable to fully capitalize on current and new market opportunities, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations.  The loss or retirement of employees presents particular challenges to the extent they involve the departure of knowledgeable and experienced employees and the resulting need to identify and train existing or new candidates to perform necessary functions, and ineffective succession planning could result in unexpected costs, reduced productivity, and/or difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls. There is also the risk that we are unable to achieve our diversity, equity and inclusion objectives or, more broadly, to meet diversity or other  sustainability goals increasingly required by our stockholders, customers, employees and other stakeholders. If we are unable to attract and retain a qualified and diverse workforce, we may be unable to maintain our competitive position and our future success could be materially adversely affected. We have engaged in restructuring and alignment activities from time to time and there can be no assurance that our efforts will have the intended effects. From time to time, we have responded to changes in our industry and the markets we serve, or other changes in our business, by restructuring or aligning our operations, including actions taken during 2020 and 2021 as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the closure of our Windsor, Colorado and Tianjin, China wind energy prepreg production facilities in 2020 and 2022, respectively, and the movement of our Research and Technology Center from Dublin, California to Salt Lake City, Utah. Due to necessary cost reduction measures or changes in the industry and markets in which we compete, we may decide to implement additional restructuring or alignment activities in the future, such as closing plants, idling certain equipment or operations, or making additions, reductions or other changes to our management or workforce. These restructuring and/or alignment activities generally result in charges and expenditures that may adversely affect our financial results for one or more periods. Restructuring and/or alignment activities can also create unanticipated consequences, such as instability or distraction among our workforce, and we cannot provide any assurance that any restructuring or alignment efforts that we undertake will be successful. A variety of risks could cause us not to realize expected cost savings, including, among others: (a) higher than expected severance costs related to headcount reductions; (b) higher than expected costs of closing plants; (c) incurring costs to hire new employees or delays or difficulty hiring the employees needed; and (d) delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to our cost-saving plan.  If we are unable to align our operations in light of evolving market conditions, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.A decrease in supply, interruptions at key facilities or an increase in cost of raw materials could result in a material decline in our profitability. Our profitability depends largely on the price and continuity of the supply of raw materials, which may be supplied through a sole source or a limited number of sources. We purchase large volumes of raw materials, such as epoxy and phenolic resins, acrylonitrile, carbon fiber, fiberglass yarn, aramid paper and, to a lesser extent, aluminum foil. Any restrictions on the supply, or an increase in the cost, including any impact of inflation or resulting from tariffs, of our raw materials could significantly reduce our profit margins. Efforts to mitigate restrictions on the supply or price increases of these raw materials by long-term purchase agreements, productivity improvements, hedging or by flowing through cost increases to our customers may not be successful.  During 2021 and 2022, as a result of the challenges created by global supply and transportation issues, the Russia/Ukraine conflict, the COVID-19 pandemic and market volatility, we experienced supply disruptions and cost increases and anticipate that supply disruptions and material shortages, as well as cost increases, will continue. While we have not experienced materially significant issues in the purchase of key raw materials, we continue to monitor the availability (including transportation) and price of raw materials on a regular basis, as well as any potential impact on our operations.The occurrence of material operational problems or interruptions, including but not limited to, as a result of the failure of key equipment, a quality or financial failure of a sole source or major supplier, the effects of natural disasters or climate change-related events, the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or other public health crises, ongoing supply chain disruptions and supply shortages, energy disruption caused by the Russia/Ukraine conflict, the inability to install, staff and/or qualify necessary capacity, political or social unrest, the failure to achieve planned manufacturing improvements or other causes, or any other inability to meet customer requirements, may have a material adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility, and could have a material effect on the Company as a whole.We have substantial international operations subject to uncertainties which could affect our operating results. We believe that revenue from sales outside the U.S. will continue to account for a material portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future. In 2022, 48% of our production and 58% of our customer sales occurred outside of the United States. Additionally, we have invested significant resources in our international operations, and we intend to continue to make such investments in the 18 future. Our business and results of operations are subject to numerous risks of doing business internationally including: (a) general economic, political, legal, social and health conditions unfavorable to our growth strategy, including the impact of a public health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or the impact of rising inflation rising and other global economic conditions on labor costs and availability; (b) longer payment cycles of foreign customers or challenges in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through some foreign legal systems; (c) the cost of compliance with international trade laws of all of the countries in which we do business, including export control laws, relating to sales and purchases of goods and equipment and transfers of technology; (d) government actions having a direct or indirect adverse impact on our international business and market opportunities, including, but not limited to, tariffs and other trade restrictions imposed by the United States, China and other jurisdictions; (e) adverse tax consequences, such as fluctuating tax rates, withholding requirements on foreign earnings or limitations on repatriations of earnings; and (f) the potential difficulty in enforcing our intellectual property rights in some foreign countries, and the potential for the intellectual property rights of others to affect our ability to sell products in certain markets. Any one of these could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. With respect to tariffs, implementation of new tariff schemes by various governments, such as those implemented by the United States and China in recent years, could potentially increase the costs of our materials, increase our cost of production, and ultimately increase the landed cost of our products sold from one country into another country. In addition, although we are not experiencing direct material adverse effects on our business resulting from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the global implications, including increased inflation, escalating energy costs, constrained raw material availability, and thus increasing costs, as well as embargos on flights from Russian airlines, are impacting the global economy and the aerospace industry in particular.Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may influence the profitability and cash flows of our business. For example, most of our European operations sell a majority of the products they produce in U.S. dollars, yet the labor, overhead costs and portions of material costs incurred in the manufacture of those products are primarily denominated in Euros, British pound sterling or U.S. dollars. As a result, the local currency margins of goods manufactured with costs denominated in local currency, yet sold in U.S. dollars, will vary with fluctuations in currency exchange rates, reducing when the U.S. dollar weakens against the Euro and British pound sterling. In addition, the reported U.S. dollar value of the local currency financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries will vary with fluctuations in currency exchange rates. While we enter into currency hedge agreements to mitigate these types of fluctuations, we cannot remove all fluctuations or hedge all exposures, or we may not be successful in hedging our exposure, and our earnings are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates.We currently do not have political risk insurance in the countries in which we conduct business. While we carefully consider these risks when evaluating our international operations, we cannot provide assurance that we will not be materially adversely affected as a result of such risks.We could be adversely affected by environmental and safety requirements, as well as legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change. Our operations require the handling, use, storage, transport and disposal of certain regulated materials and wastes. As a result, we are subject to various laws and regulations pertaining to pollution and protection of the environment, health, and safety. These requirements govern, among other things, emissions to air, discharge to waters, the generation, handling, storage, transport, treatment and disposal of regulated materials and waste, and remediation of contaminated sites. We have made, and will continue to make, capital and other expenditures in order to comply with these laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become more stringent in the future.In some cases, regulatory bodies have decided and may decide in the future to limit or ban certain materials we use in our manufacturing process due to potentially significant health and safety risks to people or the environment.  Such limitations or bans have resulted in, and may in the future require us to consider, the use of alternative raw materials or changes to our method of operations.  Such alternatives often require customer approval and may result in additional costs, including higher raw material expenses, changes in operational methods, and additional customer qualifications. The formulation changes could also impact the utility of our products.We have been named as a “potentially responsible party” under Superfund or similar state laws at certain former and current sites requiring clean up. These laws generally impose liability for costs to investigate and remediate contamination without regard to fault. Under certain circumstances, liability may be joint and several, resulting in one responsible party being held responsible for the entire cleanup obligation. Liability may also include damages to natural resources. We have incurred and likely will continue to incur expenses to investigate and clean up certain of our existing and former facilities, for which we believe we have adequate reserves. The ongoing operation of our manufacturing plants also entails environmental risks, and we may incur material costs or liabilities in the future that could adversely affect us. Although most of our properties have been the subject of environmental site assessments, there can be no assurance that all potential instances of soil and groundwater contamination have been identified, even at those sites where 19 assessments have been conducted. Accordingly, we may discover previously unknown environmental conditions and the cost of remediating such conditions may be material. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We may also be required to comply with evolving environmental, health and safety laws, regulations or requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future or to address newly discovered information or conditions that require a response. In particular, concerns about the relationship between greenhouse gases and global climate change, and an increased focus on carbon neutrality, may result in additional regulations at the national and international level to monitor, regulate, control and tax emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. A number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative or regulatory changes in response to climate change, including regulating greenhouse gas emissions, and there continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. The outcome of new legislation or regulation in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate may result in new or additional requirements and fees or restrictions on certain activities.  Our manufacturing plants use energy, including electricity and natural gas, and some of our plants emit amounts of greenhouse gases that may in the future be affected by these legislative and regulatory efforts.  Compliance with greenhouse gas and climate change initiatives may result in additional costs to us, including increased energy, transportation and raw material costs, additional taxes, reduced emission allowances or additional restrictions on production or operations.  We may also be required to make additional investments in our facilities and equipment, change our manufacturing processes, obtain substitute materials which may cost more or be less available, fund offset projects, or undertake other costly activities.  In addition, failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in fines and could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We could also face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change.In addition to regulatory compliance, growing customer environmental and sustainability requirements, including procurement policies that include social and emissions reduction or other environmental standards and requirements that their suppliers are required comply with, as well as sustainability goals that we have adopted, could cause us to alter our manufacturing, operations or equipment processes, and incur substantial expense to meet these requirements. We are actively reviewing and implementing projects to reduce our energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions, but there is no guarantee that such options or projects may be technologically and/or environmentally feasible, or that we will be able to implement any such projects on a timely or cost-effective basis.  The failure to comply with such customer requirements, or similar types of requests, could adversely affect our relationships with some customers, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, our reputation could be damaged if we or others in our industry do not act, or are perceived not to act, responsibly with respect to our impact on the environment, or if we fail to achieve our sustainability goals, which could limit our ability to grow and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.Our business and operations may be adversely affected by cybersecurity breaches or other information technology system or network intrusions. We depend heavily on information technology and computerized systems to communicate and operate effectively. We store sensitive data, including proprietary business information, intellectual property, regulated data (U.S. government and other), customer data and confidential employee or other personal data, in our systems.  In addition to internal information technology systems, we leverage cloud-based systems, where data is stored and exchanged with external third-party vendors. From time to time, we experience cyberattacks on our information technology systems, including vendor-hosted systems, which are becoming more sophisticated and could have a material impact on us. These cyberattacks, which could be related to industrial or foreign government espionage, activism, or financial motivations, include attempting to covertly introduce malware to our systems, performing reconnaissance, impersonating authorized users, and stealing, corrupting, or restricting our access to data, among other activities. We continue to update our infrastructure, security tools, planning, employee training and processes to protect against security incidents, including both external and internal threats, and to prevent their occurrence or recurrence. While Company personnel have been tasked to detect and investigate such incidents, future cyberattacks could still occur and may lead to data corruption or loss of data and exposure of proprietary and confidential information, disruptions in or damage to critical systems and theft of data, funds, or intellectual property. In addition, we face information technology security and fraud risks due to our increased reliance on remote work, which may create additional information security vulnerabilities and/or magnify the impact of any disruption in information technology systems. The unauthorized use of our confidential or proprietary business information could harm our competitive position and reputation, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, breach contractual commitments to our customers, or otherwise adversely affect our business. An intrusion may also cause operational stoppages or result in fines, penalties, litigation or governmental investigations and proceedings, diminished competitive advantages through reputational damages and increased operational costs. Further, cybersecurity and data protection laws and regulations continue to evolve, and are increasingly demanding, both in the U.S. and globally, which adds compliance complexity and may increase our costs of compliance and expose us to litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions or fines in one or more jurisdictions. Additionally, we 20 have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, costs to comply with increased cybersecurity protections and standards of our customers, including the U.S. government. We operate our business in regions subject to natural disasters and other severe weather events and any disruption to our business resulting from such events will adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.   We operate, and rely on suppliers who operate, in regions subject to natural disasters and other severe weather events. Extreme weather events and changing weather patterns present physical risks on existing infrastructure that may become more frequent or more severe as a result of factors related to climate change. In addition, the impacts of climate change on global water resources may result in water scarcity, which could in the future impact our ability to access sufficient quantities of water in certain locations and result in increased costs. We have in the past and will continue in the future to assess potential manufacturing and operational risks related to climate change, including risk of exposure to significant rainfall, flooding, hurricane or tornado events within our supply chain. We previously determined that we have a small percentage of suppliers who manufacture in vulnerable locations, which may impact distribution of raw materials to our operations, although we have taken actions to mitigate the potential impact where possible.  We also have two sites in the southeast United States, a region vulnerable to severe weather events (i.e., hurricanes, tornadoes and floods), that are associated with excess warming. Although preventative measures may help to mitigate damage, any disaster could adversely affect our ability to conduct business, including disrupting our supply of raw materials, damaging our manufacturing facilities or otherwise affecting production, transportation and delivery of our products or affect demand for our products, and the insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from any business interruption resulting from a natural disaster or other severe weather events. Further, recurring extreme weather events could reduce the availability or increase the cost of insurance. Any future disruptions to our operations, as a result of a natural disaster or severe weather event could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Our business could be negatively impacted by sustainability/environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters and/or our reporting of such matters.      There is an increasing focus from certain investors, customers, employees, and other stakeholders concerning sustainability/ESG matters, and an increasing number of investors are requiring companies to disclose sustainability/ESG policies, practices and metrics. Our customers may require us to implement sustainability/ESG responsibility procedures or standards before they continue to do business with us. Additionally, we may face reputational challenges in the event that our sustainability/ESG policies, practices and metrics do not meet the standards set by certain constituencies, which are often inconsistent in approach.      In addition, from time to time, we communicate certain initiatives or goals regarding sustainability/ESG matters. Although we intend to meet these commitments, we may be required to expend significant resources to do so, which could increase our operational costs. Further, there can be no assurance of the extent to which any of our commitments will be achieved, if at all; we could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of such initiatives or goals, or we could fail in fully and accurately reporting our progress on such initiatives and goals. In addition, we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals or perceived as not acting responsibly in connection with these matters. Any such matters could have a material adverse effect on our business.Risks Related to Our Common StockWe cannot make any guarantees with respect to payment of dividends on, or repurchases of, our common stock. In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, in April 2020, we suspended our dividend payments and stock repurchases.  Our board of directors regularly evaluates our capital allocation strategy and dividend policy, and determined to declare our first quarterly dividend since the first quarter of 2020 on January 26, 2022. The Company declared a quarterly dividend throughout 2022.  Any future determination to pay, maintain or increase cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon, among other factors, our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements and contractual or legal restrictions, including the requirements of our revolving credit facility and other financing agreements to which we may be a party. No assurance can be given that cash dividends will continue to be declared and paid at historical levels or at all.  Our share repurchase program does not have an expiration date, and we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares, on any particular timetable or at all. There can be no assurance that we will repurchase stock at favorable prices. As described above, activity under this program has been suspended, and there can be no assurance whether or when activity will resume. If resumed, the repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time and, even if fully implemented, may not enhance long-term stockholder value. The program, and any purchases under the program, may also be impacted by proposed SEC rules relating to company share repurchases, which are currently expected to be adopted in 2023. 21  Our amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for certain legal actions between us and our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against the Company and our directors and officers.  Our amended and restated bylaws provide to the fullest extent permitted by law that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) or our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, or amended and restated bylaws, or any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the State of Delaware.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, this exclusive forum provision applies to state and federal law claims, including claims under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, although the Company will not be deemed to have waived its compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ organizational documents has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with claims arising under federal securities laws or otherwise, a court could find the exclusive forum provision contained in the amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable.  This exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with the Company or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against the Company and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Certain provisions of our charter, bylaws, and of the DGCL have anti-takeover effects and could delay, discourage, defer or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider to be in the stockholders’ best interests.  Certain provisions of our charter and bylaws and the DGCL may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our board of directors determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Such provisions include, among other things, those that: •prohibit stockholders from taking action by written consent and do not permit stockholders to call a special meeting;•authorize the board of directors, without further action by the stockholders, to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series, and with respect to each series, to fix the number of shares constituting that series, and establish the rights and terms of that series;•establish advance notice procedures for stockholders to submit proposals and nominations of candidates for election to the board of directors to be brought before a stockholders meeting;•allow our directors to establish the size of the board of directors (so long as the board of directors consists of at least three and no more than fifteen directors) and fill vacancies on the board of directors created by an increase in the number of directors (subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock to elect additional directors under specified circumstances);•do not provide stockholders cumulative voting rights with respect to director elections; •provide that the bylaws may be amended by the board of directors without stockholder approval, to the extent permitted by law; and•do not opt out of Section 203 of the DGCL, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in a “business combination” with any interested stockholder (generally speaking, a stockholder who holds 15% or more of our voting stock) for three years from the date such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless certain conditions are met.       These provisions may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in the Company’s control or change in the board of directors or management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares of common stock or transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests. Accordingly, these provisions could adversely affect the price of our common stock. 22 "
6,HXL,HEXCEL CORP,2022-02-09,"ITEM 1A. Risk Factors
 You should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents we incorporate by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the material risks affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be material that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of 13 operations or cash flows in the future, and may require significant management time and attention. You should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk has not already materialized. Risks Related to the COVID-19 PandemicOur business has been and will continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict.The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created significant uncertainty and economic disruption and has negatively affected the business and results of operations for the Company.  Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the pandemic, we cannot reasonably estimate the full extent of the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and there is no guarantee our efforts to address the adverse impacts of COVID-19 will be effective.While all of our manufacturing sites are currently in operation, during 2020 and 2021 we reduced or furloughed certain operations in response to government measures, employee welfare concerns and the impact of COVID-19 on the global demand and supply chain. Our manufacturing operations may be further adversely affected by impacts from COVID-19, including, the reimplementation of previously lifted measures or imposition of new measures, such as the mandatory vaccination measures in the United States and other locations in which we operate, further decreases in demand and/or deeper supply chain disruptions, shortages in necessary raw materials and resulting cost inflation, and health and availability of essential onsite personnel. While subject to ongoing legal challenge, the U.S. government through executive order and other regulatory action, has attempted to implement mandatory vaccination and other workforce safety measures related to COVID-19 applicable to our business that could materially impact our operations, and vaccine mandates may also be implemented in other jurisdictions in which we operate. Any inability to meet our customers’ needs due to any of the foregoing could negatively impact our business and reputation.We are heavily dependent on sales to customers in the aerospace industry, which has been materially negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Travel restrictions, as well as changes in the propensity for the general public to travel by air as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, have caused reductions in demand for commercial aircraft, which has had an adverse impact on our sales and operating results and may continue to do so for an extended period of time. While we remain unable to predict the magnitude and duration of such impact, the further loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by Airbus or Boeing will materially impair our business, operating results, prospects, and financial conditions.Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in market volatility, which previously caused a significant decline in our stock price, subjecting us to increased takeover risk, impaired our ability to declare dividends or other distributions and conduct share buybacks, which may impact our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness and raise additional funds when and as needed. We may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by COVID-19 related business disruptions, performance delays or interruptions, which could lead to additional charges, impairments, and other adverse financial impacts. We cannot predict at this time the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will adversely impact our business, results, and financial condition, which will depend on many factors that are currently not known. These include, among others, (i) the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic; (ii) the effectiveness of the actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact; (iii) the extent of further disruption to the manufacturing of and demand for our products and our ability to adjust our production schedules to align with changing demand; (iv) the effectiveness of our past and any potential future restructuring actions; and (v) the extent to which global economic and operating conditions, including air travel and business spending, return to their pre-pandemic levels.  In addition to the foregoing, many of the risk factors disclosed herein have been, and we anticipate will continue to be further, heightened or exacerbated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Risks Related to Our Strategy The markets in which we operate can be cyclical, and downturns in them may adversely affect the results of our operations. Some of the markets in which we operate have been, to varying degrees, cyclical and have experienced downturns. A downturn in these markets could occur at any time as a result of events that are industry specific, such as aircraft production slowdown resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on air travel, the Boeing 737 MAX grounding or regulatory scrutiny of the Boeing 787, or macroeconomic, such as an economic downturn. Any deterioration in any of the cyclical markets we serve could adversely affect our financial performance and operating results, as occurred during 2020 and 2021 with respect to the Commercial Aerospace industry.14 During both 2020 and 2021, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Commercial Aerospace, we experienced a material decrease in demand, resulting in order cancellations and deferrals from our Commercial Aerospace customers, which resulted in decreased sales for our Commercial Aerospace products and reduced operating income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. To the extent there are any further significant deferrals, cancellations, or reductions in demand results in decreased aircraft build rates, including as a result of the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it would have a further negative impact on sales for our Commercial Aerospace products and as a result reduce our operating income.  Approximately 50% of our sales for 2021 were derived from sales to the Commercial Aerospace industry. Reductions in demand for commercial aircraft or a delay in deliveries could result from many factors, including delays in the startup or ramp-up of new programs, suspension or discontinuation of current commercial aircraft programs, changes in the propensity for the general public to travel by air (including as a result of terrorist events and any subsequent military response or a public health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic), a significant change in the cost of aviation fuel, a change in technology resulting in the use of alternative materials, environmental concerns (including climate change), consolidation and liquidation of airlines, availability of funding for new aircraft purchases or leases, inventory corrections or disruptions throughout the supply chain and slower macroeconomic growth. Although U.S. domestic air travel has increased during 2021, international travel has not yet begun to recover at the same pace. Furthermore, as companies and employees become accustomed to working remotely, business travel and the associated flight hours may not reach pre-pandemic levels. At different times, both Airbus and Boeing have experienced various delays in the start and ramp up of several aircraft programs. In the past, these have delayed our expected growth, or our effective utilization of capacity installed for such growth. Future delays, or production cuts arising from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, future pandemics or other macro-economic factors in these or other major new customer programs could similarly impact our results.In addition, our customers continue to emphasize the need for cost reduction or other improvements in contract terms throughout the supply chain. In response to these pressures, we may be required to accept increased risk or face the prospects of margin compression on some products in the future. Where possible, we seek to offset or mitigate the impact of such pressures through productivity and performance improvements, cost index contractual provisions, hedging and other actions.A significant decline in business with Airbus, Boeing, or other significant customers could materially impact our business, operating results, prospects, and financial condition. We have concentrated customers in the Commercial Aerospace and the Space & Defense markets. In the Commercial Aerospace market, approximately 82%, and in the Space & Defense market, approximately 22%, of our 2021 sales were made to Airbus and Boeing and their related subcontractors. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, approximately 33% and 33% of our total consolidated sales, respectively, were to Airbus, and its related subcontractors and approximately 16% and 19% of our total consolidated sales, respectively, were to Boeing and its related subcontractors. Significant changes in the demand for our customers’ end products, program delays, the share of their requirements that is awarded to us or changes in the design or materials used to construct their products could result in a significant loss of business with these customers. The loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by Airbus or Boeing or any of our other significant customers could materially impair our business, operating results, prospects and financial condition. The level of purchases and product mix demanded by our customers is often affected by events beyond their control, including general economic conditions, demand for their products, conditions in the airline industry, disruptions in deliveries, business disruptions, strikes and other factors, including the previous grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX by the Federal Aviation Administration and other regulators and the regulatory scrutiny of the Boeing 787 causing production delays, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on air travel and general economic conditions. Further delays in the production ramp-up of the Boeing 737 MAX or the Boeing 787, and the continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.Reductions in space and defense spending could result in a decline in our sales. Space and defense production that has occurred in recent years may not be sustained, individual programs important to Hexcel may be cancelled, production may not continue to grow and the increased demand for composite-intensive programs may not continue. In addition, the production of military aircraft depends upon defense budgets and the related demand for defense and related equipment. Approximately 33% of our sales in 2021 were to the Space & Defense market, of which approximately 79% were related to military programs in the United States and other countries. In addition to normal business risks, our indirect supply of products to the U.S. government is subject to unique risks largely beyond our control. U.S. Department of Defense budgets could be negatively impacted by several factors, including, but not limited to, a change in defense spending policy as a result of the current political environment or otherwise, the U.S. government’s budget deficits, spending priorities (e.g., allocating more spending to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic), increased defense regulatory requirements resulting in additional expenses, the cost of sustaining the U.S. military presence internationally and possible political pressure to reduce military spending, each of which could cause the U.S. Department of Defense budget to remain unchanged or to decline.If we fail to comply with government procurement laws and regulations, we could lose business and be liable for various penalties or sanctions.   15 We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. government contracts, including the government security requirements and additional government export control laws and regulations, as well as certain cybersecurity certifications and other cybersecurity requirements. These regulations and other requirements regularly evolve, and new laws, regulations or procurement requirements or changes to current ones (including, for example, regulations related to cybersecurity and related certification requirements for us and our partners, privacy, information protection, cost accounting, recovery of employee compensation costs, counterfeit parts, pensions, anti-human trafficking, specialty metals, conflict minerals and use of certain non-U.S. equipment and materials) could significantly increase our costs and risks and reduce our profitability. In complying with these laws and regulations, we may incur significant costs, and non-compliance may result in the imposition of fines and penalties, including contractual damages. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or if a government audit, review, or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil penalties, criminal penalties, or administrative sanctions or suspension or debarment from contracting with the U.S. government. If we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis, it could adversely affect our business and prospects. We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop, on a timely basis, technologically advanced products that meet or exceed current industry standards, including developing products with an improved environmental footprint. Although we believe we have certain technological and other advantages over our competitors, maintaining such advantages will require us to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses.Acquisitions, divestitures, mergers, business combinations or joint ventures may entail certain operational and financial risks. Over the past several years, we have completed strategic acquisitions of complementary manufacturing companies, as well as strategic investments in companies. We expect to continue to explore complementary mergers, acquisitions, investments and joint ventures and may also pursue divestures of business lines or investments that do not fit with our core strategy. We may also engage in further vertical integration. We may face competition for attractive targets and may not be able to acquire potential targets at prices acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, these types of transactions may require significant liquidity, which may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.We cannot provide any assurance that we will realize the intended benefits from any such transactions. The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations. Even if successfully integrated, the acquired business may not achieve the results we expect or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned.  Risks Related to Our OperationsOur operations would be adversely affected by a shortage of trained personnel or work stoppages. Our business has historically been dependent on a highly trained workforce because of the complex nature of our products. Furthermore, as of December 31, 2021, approximately 30% of employees in the United States and the majority of those in Europe were represented by collective bargaining agreements. During 2020 and 2021, we furloughed or eliminated a significant portion of our skilled workforce as a result of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on our customer demand. If the demand for trained personnel returns to pre-COVID-19 levels, and we are unable to quickly reassemble our workforce and subsequently retain a sufficient number of trained personnel, including as a result of any applicable vaccination mandate, or we experience a significant or prolonged work stoppage in such an environment, our ability to secure new business and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.Our ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital to our success. Our success, competitiveness and ability to execute on our global strategies and maintain a culture of innovation depend in large part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees and leaders with expertise and capabilities, representing diverse backgrounds and experiences. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, management changes, increasing local and global competition for talent, particularly due to the increase in remote working opportunities resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the availability of qualified employees, restructuring and alignment activities (including workforce reductions), and the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs. If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees and leaders, we may be unable to fully capitalize on current and new market opportunities, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations.  The loss or retirement of employees presents particular challenges to the extent they involve the departure of knowledgeable and experienced employees and 16 the resulting need to identify and train existing or new candidates to perform necessary functions, and ineffective succession planning could result in unexpected costs, reduced productivity, and/or difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls. There is also the risk that we are unable to achieve our diversity, equity and inclusion objectives or, more broadly, to meet sustainability goals increasingly required by our stockholders, employees and other stakeholders. If we are unable to attract and retain a qualified and diverse workforce, we may be unable to maintain our competitive position and our future success could be materially adversely affected. We have engaged in restructuring and alignment activities from time to time and there can be no assurance that our efforts will have the intended effects. From time to time, we have responded to changes in our industry and the markets we serve, or other changes in our business, by restructuring or aligning our operations, including actions taken during 2020 and 2021 as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the closure of our Windsor, Colorado wind energy prepreg production facility in 2020. Due to necessary cost reduction measures or changes in the industry and markets in which we compete, we may decide to implement additional restructuring or alignment activities in the future, such as closing plants, idling certain equipment or operations, or making additions, reductions or other changes to our management or workforce. These restructuring and/or alignment activities generally result in charges and expenditures that may adversely affect our financial results for one or more periods. Restructuring and/or alignment activities can also create unanticipated consequences, such as instability or distraction among our workforce, and we cannot provide any assurance that any restructuring or alignment efforts that we undertake will be successful. A variety of risks could cause us not to realize expected cost savings, including, among others: (a) higher than expected severance costs related to headcount reductions; (b) higher than expected costs of closing plants; (c) incurring costs to hire new employees or delays or difficulty hiring the employees needed; and (d) delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to our cost-saving plan.  If we are unable to align our operations in light of evolving market conditions, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.A decrease in supply, interruptions at key facilities or an increase in cost of raw materials could result in a material decline in our profitability. Our profitability depends largely on the price and continuity of the supply of raw materials, which may be supplied through a sole source or a limited number of sources. We purchase large volumes of raw materials, such as epoxy and phenolic resins, acrylonitrile, carbon fiber, fiberglass yarn, aramid paper and, to a lesser extent, aluminum foil. Any restrictions on the supply, or an increase in the cost, including any impact of inflation or resulting from tariffs, of our raw materials could significantly reduce our profit margins. Efforts to mitigate restrictions on the supply or price increases of these raw materials by long-term purchase agreements, productivity improvements, hedging or by flowing through cost increases to our customers may not be successful.  During 2021, as a result of the challenges created by global transportation issues, the COVID-19 pandemic and market volatility, we experienced minor supply disruptions and anticipate that supply disruptions and material shortages may continue. While we have not experienced materially significant issues in the purchase of key raw materials, we continue to monitor the availability (including transportation) and price of raw materials on a regular basis, as well as any potential impact on our operations.The occurrence of material operational problems or interruptions, including but not limited to, as a result of the failure of key equipment, a quality or financial failure of a sole source or major supplier, the effects of natural disasters or climate change-related events, the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or other public health crises, ongoing supply chain disruptions and supply shortages, the inability to install, staff and/or qualify necessary capacity, political or social unrest, the failure to achieve planned manufacturing improvements or other causes, or any other inability to meet customer requirements, may have a material adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility, and could have a material effect on the Company as a whole. In addition, the increasing focus on reducing energy usage and improving the environmental impact and sustainability associated with manufacturing operations, including through legislation or government regulations, may increase our costs and could impact production if we are required to implement certain environmental or sustainability measures at our facilities.We have substantial international operations subject to uncertainties which could affect our operating results. We believe that revenue from sales outside the U.S. will continue to account for a material portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future. In 2021, 48% of our production and 59% of our customer sales occurred outside of the United States. Additionally, we have invested significant resources in our international operations, and we intend to continue to make such investments in the future. Our international operations are subject to numerous risks, including: (a) general economic, political, legal, social and health conditions in the countries where we operate may have an adverse effect on our operations in those countries or not be favorable to our growth strategy, such as the impact of a public health crisis, including the COVID-19 pandemic, or social unrest on employees and the global economy or the impact of inflation, as well as changes in existing and expected rates of inflation, which may vary across the jurisdictions in which we do business; (b) the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through some foreign legal systems; (c) foreign customers may have longer payment cycles than customers in the United States; (d) the cost of compliance with international trade laws of all of the countries in which we do business, including export control laws, relating to sales and purchases 17 of goods and equipment and transfers of technology; (e) loss of sales to international customers, including those located in China and Russia, as a result of more stringent trade control laws in the United States; (f) tax rates may vary and foreign earnings may be subject to withholding requirements or the imposition of exchange controls or other restrictions; (g) governments may adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on our business and market opportunities, including, but not limited to, resulting from tariffs and other trade restrictions imposed by the United States, China and other jurisdictions; and (h) the potential difficulty in enforcing our intellectual property rights in some foreign countries, and the potential for the intellectual property rights of others to affect our ability to sell products in certain markets. Any one of these could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. With respect to tariffs, implementation of new tariff schemes by various governments, such as those implemented by the United States and China in recent years, could potentially increase the costs of our materials, increase our cost of production, and ultimately increase the landed cost of our products sold from one country into another country. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may influence the profitability and cash flows of our business. For example, most of our European operations sell a majority of the products they produce in U.S. dollars, yet the labor, overhead costs and portions of material costs incurred in the manufacture of those products are primarily denominated in Euros, British pound sterling or U.S. dollars. As a result, the local currency margins of goods manufactured with costs denominated in local currency, yet sold in U.S. dollars, will vary with fluctuations in currency exchange rates, reducing when the U.S. dollar weakens against the Euro and British pound sterling. In addition, the reported U.S. dollar value of the local currency financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries will vary with fluctuations in currency exchange rates. While we enter into currency hedge agreements to mitigate these types of fluctuations, we cannot remove all fluctuations or hedge all exposures, and our earnings are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates.We currently do not have political risk insurance in the countries in which we conduct business. While we carefully consider these risks when evaluating our international operations, we cannot provide assurance that we will not be materially adversely affected as a result of such risks.We could be adversely affected by environmental and safety requirements. Our operations require the handling, use, storage, transport and disposal of certain regulated materials and wastes. As a result, we are subject to various laws and regulations pertaining to pollution and protection of the environment, health, and safety. These requirements govern, among other things, emissions to air, discharge to waters, the generation, handling, storage, transport, treatment and disposal of regulated materials and waste, and remediation of contaminated sites. We have made, and will continue to make, capital and other expenditures in order to comply with these laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become more stringent in the future.We have been named as a “potentially responsible party” under Superfund or similar state laws at our former and current sites requiring clean up. These laws generally impose liability for costs to investigate and remediate contamination without regard to fault. Under certain circumstances, liability may be joint and several, resulting in one responsible party being held responsible for the entire cleanup obligation. Liability may also include damages to natural resources. We have incurred and likely will continue to incur expenses to investigate and clean up certain of our existing and former facilities, for which we believe we have adequate reserves. The ongoing operation of our manufacturing plants also entails environmental risks, and we may incur material costs or liabilities in the future that could adversely affect us. Although most of our properties have been the subject of environmental site assessments, there can be no assurance that all potential instances of soil and groundwater contamination have been identified, even at those sites where assessments have been conducted. Accordingly, we may discover previously unknown environmental conditions and the cost of remediating such conditions may be material. See “Legal Proceedings” below and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We may also be required to comply with evolving environmental, health and safety laws, regulations or requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future or to address newly discovered information or conditions that require a response. In particular, climate change is receiving increased attention worldwide, which presents both risks and opportunities for our businesses as legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions increase.  Our manufacturing plants use energy, including electricity and natural gas, and some of our plants emit amounts of greenhouse gases that may in the future be affected by these legislative and regulatory efforts. Potential consequences could include increased energy, transportation and raw material costs and may require us to make additional investments in our facilities and equipment, increase our expenditures or limit our ability to grow. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in fines and could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We could also face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change.In addition to regulatory compliance, growing customer environmental and sustainability requirements, including procurement policies that include social and environmental responsibility provisions or requirements that their suppliers are required comply with, 18 as well as sustainability goals that we have adopted, could cause us to alter our manufacturing, operations or equipment processes, and incur substantial expense to meet these requirements. The failure to comply with such customer requirements, or similar types of requests, could adversely affect our relationships with some customers, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, our reputation could be damaged if we or others in our industry do not act, or are perceived not to act, responsibly with respect to our impact on the environment, or if we fail to achieve our sustainability goals, which could limit our ability to grow and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.Our business and operations may be adversely affected by cybersecurity breaches or other information technology system or network intrusions. We depend heavily on information technology and computerized systems to communicate and operate effectively. We store sensitive data, including proprietary business information, intellectual property and confidential employee or other personal data, on our servers and databases. In addition to traditional information technology systems, we leverage cloud-based systems, where data is stored and exchanged with external third-party vendors. From time to time, we experience cyberattacks on our information technology systems, including vendor-hosted systems. Attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems have become more sophisticated and could be material. These attempts, which could be related to industrial or foreign government espionage, activism, or other motivations, include attempting to covertly introducing malware to our systems, performing reconnaissance, impersonating authorized users, and stealing, corrupting, or restricting our access to data, among other activities. We continue to update our infrastructure, security tools, employee training and processes to protect against security incidents, including both external and internal threats, and to prevent their occurrence or recurrence. While Company personnel have been tasked to detect and investigate such incidents, future cybersecurity attacks could still occur and may lead to potential data corruption or loss of data and exposure of proprietary and confidential information, disruptions in critical systems and theft of data, funds, or intellectual property. In addition, we face increased information technology security and fraud risks due to our increased reliance on working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which may create additional information security vulnerabilities and/or magnify the impact of any disruption in information technology systems. The unauthorized use of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reputation, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. An intrusion may also cause operational stoppages or result in fines, penalties, litigation or governmental investigations and proceedings, diminished competitive advantages through reputational damages and increased operational costs. Further, cybersecurity and data protection laws and regulations continue to evolve, and are increasingly demanding, both in the U.S. and globally, which adds compliance complexity and may increase our costs of compliance and expose us to litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions or fines in one or more jurisdictions. Additionally, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, additional costs to comply with our customers’, including the U.S. government’s, increased cybersecurity protections and standards. We operate our business in regions subject to natural disasters and other severe weather events and any disruption to our business resulting from such events will adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.  We operate, and rely on suppliers who operate, in regions subject to natural disasters and other severe weather events. In addition, extreme weather events and changing weather patterns present physical risks on existing infrastructure that may become more frequent or more severe as a result of factors related to climate change. We have in the past and will continue in the future to assess potential manufacturing risks related to climate change, including risk of exposure to significant rainfall, flooding, hurricane or tornado events within our supply chain. We previously determined that we have a small percentage of suppliers who manufacture in vulnerable locations, which may impact distribution of raw materials to our operations, although we have taken actions to mitigate the potential impact where possible.  We also have two sites in the southeast United States, a region vulnerable to severe weather events (i.e., hurricanes, tornadoes and floods), that are associated with excess warming. Although preventative measures may help to mitigate damage, any disaster could adversely affect our ability to conduct business, including disrupting our supply of raw materials, damaging our manufacturing facilities or otherwise affecting production, transportation and delivery of our products or affect demand for our products, and the insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from any business interruption resulting from a natural disaster or other severe weather events. Any future disruptions to our operations, as a result of a natural disaster or severe weather event could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Our business could be negatively impacted by sustainability/environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters and/or our reporting of such matters.       There is an increasing focus from certain investors, customers, employees, and other stakeholders concerning sustainability/ESG matters, and an increasing number of investors are requiring companies to disclose corporate sustainability/ESG policies, practices and metrics. Our customers may require us to implement sustainability/ESG responsibility procedures or standards before they continue to 19 do business with us. Additionally, we may face reputational challenges in the event that our sustainability/ESG responsibility procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by certain constituencies.      In addition, from time to time, we communicate certain initiatives or goals regarding sustainability/ESG matters. Although we intend to meet these commitments, we may be required to expend significant resources to do so, which could increase our operational costs. Further, there can be no assurance of the extent to which any of our commitments will be achieved, if at all; we could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of such initiatives or goals, or we could fail in fully and accurately reporting our progress on such initiatives and goals. In addition, we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals or perceived as not acting responsibly in connection with these matters. Any such matters could have a material adverse effect on our business.Risks Related to Our Common StockWe cannot make any guarantees with respect to payment of dividends on, or repurchases of, our common stock. In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, in April 2020, we suspended our dividend payments and stock repurchases. In addition, in January 2021, we entered into an amendment to our Facility (as defined below) that limits our ability to engage in share repurchases and cash dividends through and including March 31, 2022. Our board of directors regularly evaluates our capital allocation strategy and dividend policy, and determined to declare our first quarterly dividend since the first quarter of 2020 on January 26, 2022. Any future determination to pay, maintain or increase cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon, among other factors, our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements and contractual or legal restrictions, including the requirements of the Facility and other financing agreements to which we may be a party. No assurance can be given that cash dividends will be declared and paid at historical levels or at all.  Our share repurchase program does not have an expiration date, and we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares, on any particular timetable or at all. There can be no assurance that we will repurchase stock at favorable prices. As described above, activity under this program has been suspended, and there can be no assurance whether or when activity will resume. If resumed, the repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time and, even if fully implemented, may not enhance long-term stockholder value. The program, and any purchases under the program, may also be impacted by proposed SEC rules relating to share repurchases.   Our amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for certain legal actions between us and our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against the Company and our directors and officers.  Our amended and restated bylaws provide to the fullest extent permitted by law that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) or our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, or amended and restated bylaws, or any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the State of Delaware.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, this exclusive forum provision applies to state and federal law claims, including claims under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, although the Company will not be deemed to have waived its compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ organizational documents has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with claims arising under federal securities laws or otherwise, a court could find the exclusive forum provision contained in the amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable.  This exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with the Company or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against the Company and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Certain provisions of our charter, bylaws, and of the DGCL have anti-takeover effects and could delay, discourage, defer or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider to be in the stockholders’ best interests.  20 Certain provisions of our charter and bylaws and the DGCL may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our board of directors determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Such provisions include, among other things, those that: •prohibit stockholders from taking action by written consent and do not permit stockholders to call a special meeting;•authorize the board of directors, without further action by the stockholders, to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series, and with respect to each series, to fix the number of shares constituting that series, and establish the rights and terms of that series;•establish advance notice procedures for stockholders to submit proposals and nominations of candidates for election to the board of directors to be brought before a stockholders meeting;•allow our directors to establish the size of the board of directors (so long as the board of directors consists of at least three and no more than fifteen directors) and fill vacancies on the board of directors created by an increase in the number of directors (subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock to elect additional directors under specified circumstances);•do not provide stockholders cumulative voting rights with respect to director elections; •provide that the bylaws may be amended by the board of directors without stockholder approval, to the extent permitted by law; and•do not opt out of Section 203 of the DGCL, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in a “business combination” with any interested stockholder (generally speaking, a stockholder who holds 15% or more of our voting stock) for three years from the date such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless certain conditions are met.       These provisions may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in the Company’s control or change in the board of directors or management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares of common stock or transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests. Accordingly, these provisions could adversely affect the price of our common stock. "

 An investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties.  You should consider the following risk factors carefully, in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase any of our securities. The markets in which we operate can be cyclical, and downturns in them may adversely affect the results of our operations. Some of the markets in which we operate have been, to varying degrees, cyclical and have experienced downturns.  A downturn in these markets could occur at any time as a result of events that are industry specific or macroeconomic and in the event of a downturn; we have no way of knowing if, when and to what extent there might be a recovery.  Any deterioration in any of the cyclical markets we serve could adversely affect our financial performance and operating results. At December 31, 2013, Airbus and Boeing had a combined backlog of 10,639 aircraft, which is the highest in history and more than eight years of production at 2013 delivery rates.  To the extent any significant deferrals, cancellations or reduction in demand results in decreased aircraft build rates, it would reduce net sales for our Commercial Aerospace products and as a result reduce our operating income.  Approximately 65% of our net sales for 2013 were derived from sales to the Commercial Aerospace industry, which includes 85% from Airbus and Boeing aircraft and 15% from regional and business aircraft.  Reductions in demand for commercial aircraft or a delay in deliveries could result from many factors, including delays in the startup or ramp-up of new programs, changes in the propensity for the general public to travel by air (including as a result of terrorist events and any subsequent military response), a rise in the cost of aviation fuel, a change in technology resulting in the use of alternative materials, consolidation and liquidation of airlines, availability of funding for new aircraft purchases or leases, inventory corrections or disruptions throughout the supply chain and slower macroeconomic growth. The A350 had its first flight in June 2013 and its first delivery is now expected in the fourth quarter of 2014.  Our content per plane is approximately $5 million and we expect the A350 will be our largest program with sales of approximately $600 million per year when Airbus reaches its projected buildrates of 120 per year.  Both Airbus and Boeing have experienced various delays in their newest aircraft programs, including the A380, B787, B747-8, A400M, and A350.  In the past, these have delayed our expected growth or our effective utilization of capacity installed for such growth.  Future delays in these or other major new customer programs could similarly impact our results. 10 In addition, our customers continue to emphasize the need for cost reduction or other improvements in contract terms throughout the supply chain.  In response to these pressures, we may be required to accept increased risk or face the prospects of margin compression on some products in the future. Where possible, we seek to offset or mitigate the impact of such pressures through productivity and performance improvements, index clauses, currency hedging and other actions. A significant decline in business with Boeing, Airbus, Vestas, or other significant customers could materially impact our business, operating results, prospects and financial condition. We have concentrated customers in the Commercial Aerospace and wind energy markets.  In the Commercial Aerospace market, approximately 85%, and in the Space & Defense market, approximately 34%, of our 2013 net sales were made to Boeing and Airbus Group and their related subcontractors.  For the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, approximately 34% and 29% of our total consolidated net sales were to Boeing and its related subcontractors, respectively, and approximately 29% and 28% of our total consolidated net sales, respectively, were to Airbus Group, including Airbus and its related subcontractors.  In the wind energy market, our primary customer is Vestas Wind Systems A/S.  Significant changes in the demand for our customers end products, program delays, the share of their requirements that is awarded to us or changes in the design or materials used to construct their products could result in a significant loss of business with these customers.  The loss of, or significant reduction in purchases by, Boeing, Airbus Group and Vestas or any of our other significant customers could materially impair our business, operating results, prospects and financial condition.  The level of purchases by our customers is often affected by events beyond their control, including general economic conditions, demand for their products, business disruptions, disruptions in deliveries, strikes and other factors. Reductions in space and defense spending could result in a decline in our net sales. The growth in space and defense production that has occurred in recent years may not be sustained, individual programs important to Hexcel may be cancelled, production may not continue to grow and the increased demand for composite-intensive programs may not continue.  In addition, the production of military aircraft depends upon defense budgets and the related demand for defense and related equipment.  Approximately 22% of our net sales in 2013 were to the Space & Defense market of which about 55% were related to U.S. military programs. A decrease in supply, interruptions at key facilities or an increase in cost of raw materials could result in a material decline in our profitability. Our profitability depends largely on the price and continuity of supply of raw materials, which may be supplied through a sole source or a limited number of sources.  We purchase large volumes of raw materials, such as epoxy and phenolic resins, carbon fiber, fiberglass yarn, aluminum foil and aramid paper.  Any restrictions on the supply, or an increase in the cost, of our raw materials could significantly reduce our profit margins.  Efforts to mitigate restrictions on the supply or price increases of these raw materials by long-term purchase agreements, productivity improvements or by passing cost increases to our customers may not be successful. The occurrence of material operational problems, including but not limited to failure of, or interruption to, key equipment or natural disasters, or inability to install, staff and qualify necessary capacity or achievement of planned manufacturing improvements, may have a material adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility.  With respect to certain facilities, such events could have a material effect on our company as a whole. We have substantial international operations subject to uncertainties which could affect our operating results. We believe that revenue from sales outside the U.S. will continue to account for a material portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future.  In 2013, 48% of our production and 54% of our customer sales occurred outside of the United States.  Additionally, we have invested significant resources in our international operations and we intend to continue to make such investments in the future.  Our international operations are subject to numerous risks, including: (a) general economic and political conditions in the countries where we operate may have an adverse effect on our operations in those countries or not be favorable to our growth strategy; (b) the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through some foreign legal systems; (c) foreign customers may have longer payment cycles than customers in the U.S.; (d) cost of compliance with international trade laws of all of the countries in which we do business, including export control laws, relating to sales and purchases of goods and equipment and transfers of technology; (e) tax rates in some foreign countries may exceed those of the U.S. and foreign earnings may be subject to withholding requirements or the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions; (f) governments may adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on our business and market opportunities; and (g) the potential difficulty in enforcing our intellectual property rights in some foreign countries, and the potential for the intellectual property rights of others to affect our ability to sell product in certain markets.  Any one of these could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 11 In addition, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may influence the profitability and cash flows of our business.  For example, our European operations sell a portion of the products they produce in U.S. dollars, yet the labor, overhead costs and portions of material costs incurred in the manufacture of those products are denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling or U.S. dollars.  As a result, the local currency margins of goods manufactured with costs denominated in local currency, yet sold in U.S. dollars, will vary with fluctuations in currency exchange rates, reducing when the U.S. dollar weakens against the Euro and British pound sterling. In addition, the reported U.S. dollar value of the local currency financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries will vary with fluctuations in currency exchange rates.  While we enter into currency exchange and hedge agreements from time to time to mitigate these types of fluctuations, we cannot remove all fluctuations or hedge all exposures, and our earnings are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates. We currently do not have political risk insurance in the countries in which we conduct business. While we carefully consider these risks when evaluating our international operations we cannot provide assurance that we will not be materially adversely affected as a result of such risks. We could be adversely affected by environmental and safety requirements. Our operations require the handling, use, storage and disposal of certain regulated materials and wastes. As a result, we are subject to various laws and regulations pertaining to pollution and protection of the environment, health and safety.  These requirements govern, among other things, emissions to air, discharge to waters and the generation, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of waste and remediation of contaminated sites.  We have made, and will continue to make, capital and other expenditures in order to comply with these laws and regulations.  These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become more stringent in the future. We have been named as a potentially responsible party under the U.S. Superfund law or similar state laws at several sites requiring clean up. These laws generally impose liability for costs to investigate and remediate contamination without regard to fault. Under certain circumstances liability may be joint and several, resulting in one responsible party being held responsible for the entire obligation.  Liability may also include damages to natural resources.  We have incurred and likely will continue to incur expenses to investigate and clean up certain of our existing and former facilities, for which we believe we have adequate reserves.  The ongoing operation of our manufacturing plants also entails environmental risks, and we may incur material costs or liabilities in the future which could adversely affect us.  Although most of our properties have been the subject of environmental site assessments, there can be no assurance that all potential instances of soil and groundwater contamination have been identified, even at those sites where assessments have been conducted.  Accordingly, we may discover previously unknown environmental conditions and the cost of remediating such conditions may be material.  See Legal Proceedings below and Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, we may be required to comply with evolving environmental, health and safety laws, regulations or requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future or to address newly discovered information or conditions that require a response. In particular, climate change is receiving increased attention worldwide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions.  The U.S. Congress has considered climate change-related legislation and may retake the issue in the near future.  Specific policy measures could include cap and trade provisions or a carbon tax.  The European Union has instituted the Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading System (EU-ETS).  Our manufacturing plants use energy, including electricity and natural gas, and some of our plants may in the future emit amounts of greenhouse gas that could be affected by these legislative and regulatory efforts. Potential consequences could include increased energy, transportation and raw material costs and may require the Company to make additional investments in its facilities and equipment or limit our ability to grow. Our forward-looking statements and projections may turn out to be inaccurate. This Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  These statements relate to analyses and other information that are based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable.  These statements also relate to future prospects, developments and business strategies.  These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as anticipate, believe, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, predict, project, should, would, will and similar terms and phrases, including references to assumptions.  Such statements are based on current expectations, are inherently uncertain, and are subject to changing assumptions. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: (a) the estimates and expectations based on aircraft production rates made publicly available by Airbus and Boeing; (b) the revenues we may generate from an aircraft model or program; (c)  the impact of the possible push-out in deliveries of the Airbus and Boeing backlog and the impact of delays in the startup or ramp-up of new aircraft programs or the final Hexcel composite material content once the design and material selection has been completed; (d) expectations of composite content on new commercial aircraft programs and our share of those requirements; (e) expectations of 12 growth in revenues from space and defense applications, including whether certain programs might be curtailed or discontinued; (f) expectations regarding growth in sales for wind energy, recreation and other industrial applications; (g) expectations regarding working capital trends and expenditures; (h) expectations as to the level of capital expenditures and when we will complete the construction and qualification of capacity expansions; (i) our ability to maintain and improve margins in light of the ramp-up of capacity and new facilities and the current economic environment; (j) the outcome of legal matters; (k) our projections regarding the realizability of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards; and (l) the impact of various market risks, including fluctuations in interest rates, currency exchange rates, environmental regulations and tax codes, fluctuations in commodity prices, and fluctuations in the market price of our common stock, the impact of work stoppages or other labor disruptions and the impact of the above factors on our expectations of 2014 financial results.  In addition, actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward looking statements due to a variety of factors, including but not limited to changing market conditions, increased competition, product mix, inability to achieve planned manufacturing improvements, cost reductions and capacity additions, and conditions in the financial markets. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the following: changes in general economic and business conditions; changes in current pricing and cost levels; changes in political and social conditions, and local regulations; foreign currency fluctuations; changes in aerospace delivery rates; reductions in sales to any significant customers, particularly Airbus, Boeing or Vestas; changes in sales mix; changes in government defense procurement budgets; changes in military aerospace programs technology; industry capacity; competition; disruptions of established supply channels, particularly where raw materials are obtained from a single or limited number of sources and cannot be substituted by unqualified alternatives; manufacturing capacity constraints; unforeseen vulnerability of our network and systems to interruptions or failures; and the availability, terms and deployment of capital. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those expected, estimated or projected.  In addition to other factors that affect our operating results and financial position, neither past financial performance nor our expectations should be considered reliable indicators of future performance.  Investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.  Further, our stock price is subject to volatility.  Any of the factors discussed above could have an adverse impact on our stock price.  In addition, failure of sales or income in any quarter to meet the investment communitys expectations, as well as broader market trends, can have an adverse impact on our stock price.  We do not undertake an obligation to update our forward-looking statements or risk factors to reflect future events or circumstances. "

 An investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties.  You should consider the following risk factors carefully, in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase any of our securities. The markets in which we operate can be cyclical, and downturns in them may adversely affect the results of our operations. Some of the markets in which we operate have been, to varying degrees, cyclical and have experienced downturns.  A downturn in these markets could occur at any time as a result of events that are industry specific or macroeconomic and in the event of a downturn, we have no way of knowing if, when and to what extent there might be a recovery.  Any deterioration in any of the cyclical markets we serve could adversely affect our financial performance and operating results. At December 31, 2012, Airbus and Boeing had a combined backlog of over 9,000 aircraft, which is the highest in history and about eight years of production at current delivery rates.  To the extent any significant deferrals, cancellations or reduction in demand results in decreased aircraft build rates, it would reduce net sales for our Commercial Aerospace products and as a result reduce our operating income.  Approximately 60% of our net sales for 2012 were derived from sales to the Commercial Aerospace industry, which includes 83% from Airbus and Boeing aircraft and 17% from regional and business aircraft.  Reductions in demand for commercial aircraft or a delay in deliveries could result from many factors, including delays in the startup or ramp-up of new programs, changes in the propensity for the general public to travel by air (including as a result of terrorist events and any subsequent military response), a rise in the cost of aviation fuel, a change in technology resulting in the use of alternative materials, consolidation and liquidation of airlines, availability of funding for new aircraft purchases or leases, inventory corrections or disruptions throughout the supply chain and slower macroeconomic growth.  Both Airbus and Boeing have experienced various delays in their newest aircraft programs, including the A380, B787, B747-8, A400M, and A350.  In the past, these have delayed our expected growth or our effective utilization of capacity installed for such growth.  Future delays in these or other major new customer programs could similarly impact our results. 10 In addition, our customers continue to emphasize the need for cost reduction or other improvements in contract terms throughout the supply chain.  In response to these pressures, we may be required to accept increased risk or face the prospects of margin compression on some products in the future. Where possible, we seek to offset or mitigate the impact of such pressures through productivity and performance improvements, index clauses, currency hedging and other actions. A significant decline in business with Boeing, EADS, Vestas, or other significant customers could materially impact our business, operating results, prospects and financial condition. We have concentrated customers in the Commercial Aerospace and wind energy markets.  In the Commercial Aerospace market, approximately 83%, and in the Space & Defense market, approximately 33%, of our 2012 net sales were made to Boeing and EADS (including Airbus) and their related subcontractors.  For the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, approximately 29% and 30% of our total consolidated net sales were to Boeing and its related subcontractors, respectively, and approximately 28% and 27% of our total consolidated net sales, respectively, were to EADS, including Airbus and its related subcontractors.  In the wind energy market, our primary customer is Vestas Wind Systems A/S.  Significant changes in the demand for our customers end products, program delays, the share of their requirements that is awarded to us or changes in the design or materials used to construct their products could result in a significant loss of business with these customers.  The loss of, or significant reduction in purchases by, Boeing, EADS and Vestas or any of our other significant customers could materially impair our business, operating results, prospects and financial condition.  The level of purchases by our customers is often affected by events beyond their control, including general economic conditions, demand for their products, business disruptions, disruptions in deliveries, strikes and other factors. Reductions in space and defense spending could result in a decline in our net sales. The growth in military aircraft production that has occurred in recent years may not be sustained, individual programs important to Hexcel may be cancelled, production may not continue to grow and the increased demand for replacement helicopter blades may not continue. The production of military aircraft depends upon defense budgets and the related demand for defense and related equipment.  Approximately 23% of our net sales in 2012 were to the Space & Defense market of which just less than 60% were related to U.S. military programs. A decrease in supply, interruptions at key facilities or an increase in cost of raw materials could result in a material decline in our profitability. Our profitability depends largely on the price and continuity of supply of raw materials, which may be supplied through a sole source or a limited number of sources.  We purchase large volumes of raw materials, such as epoxy and phenolic resins, carbon fiber, fiberglass yarn, aluminum foil and aramid paper.  Any restrictions on the supply, or an increase in the cost, of our raw materials could significantly reduce our profit margins.  Efforts to mitigate restrictions on the supply or price increases of these raw materials by long-term purchase agreements, productivity improvements or by passing cost increases to our customers may not be successful. The occurrence of material operational problems, including but not limited to failure of, or interruption to, key equipment or natural disasters, may have a material adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility. With respect to certain facilities, such events could have a material effect on our company as a whole. We have substantial international operations subject to uncertainties which could affect our operating results. We believe that revenue from sales outside the U.S. will continue to account for a material portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future.  In 2011, 49% of our production and 54% of our customer sales occurred outside of the United States.  Additionally, we have invested significant resources in our international operations and we intend to continue to make such investments in the future.  Our international operations are subject to numerous risks, including: (a) general economic and political conditions in the countries where we operate may have an adverse effect on our operations in those countries or not be favorable to our growth strategy; (b) the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through some foreign legal systems; (c) foreign customers may have longer payment cycles than customers in the U.S.; (d) cost of compliance with international trade laws of all of the countries in which we do business, including export control laws, relating to sales and purchases of goods and equipment and transfers of technology; (e) tax rates in some foreign countries may exceed those of the U.S. and foreign earnings may be subject to withholding requirements or the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions; (f) governments may adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on our business and market opportunities; and (g) the potential difficulty in enforcing our intellectual property rights in some foreign countries, and the potential for the intellectual property rights of others to affect our ability to sell product in certain markets.  Any one of these could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 11 In addition, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may influence the profitability and cash flows of our business.  For example, our European operations sell a portion of the products they produce in U.S. dollars, yet the labor, overhead costs and portions of material costs incurred in the manufacture of those products are denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling or U.S. dollars.  As a result, the local currency margins of goods manufactured with costs denominated in local currency, yet sold in U.S. dollars, will vary with fluctuations in currency exchange rates, reducing when the U.S. dollar weakens against the Euro and British pound sterling. In addition, the reported U.S. dollar value of the local currency financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries will vary with fluctuations in currency exchange rates.  While we enter into currency exchange and hedge agreements from time to time to mitigate these types of fluctuations, we cannot remove all fluctuations or hedge all exposures, and our earnings are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates. We currently do not have political risk insurance in the countries in which we conduct business. While we carefully consider these risks when evaluating our international operations we cannot provide assurance that we will not be materially adversely affected as a result of such risks. We could be adversely affected by environmental and safety requirements. Our operations require the handling, use, storage and disposal of certain regulated materials and wastes. As a result, we are subject to various laws and regulations pertaining to pollution and protection of the environment, health and safety.  These requirements govern, among other things, emissions to air, discharge to waters and the generation, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of waste and remediation of contaminated sites.  We have made, and will continue to make, capital and other expenditures in order to comply with these laws and regulations.  These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become more stringent in the future. We have been named as a potentially responsible party under the U.S. Superfund law or similar state laws at several sites requiring clean up. These laws generally impose liability for costs to investigate and remediate contamination without regard to fault. Under certain circumstances liability may be joint and several, resulting in one responsible party being held responsible for the entire obligation.  Liability may also include damages to natural resources.  We have incurred and likely will continue to incur expenses to investigate and clean up certain of our existing and former facilities, for which we believe we have adequate reserves.  The ongoing operation of our manufacturing plants also entails environmental risks, and we may incur material costs or liabilities in the future which could adversely affect us.  Although most of our properties have been the subject of environmental site assessments, there can be no assurance that all potential instances of soil and groundwater contamination have been identified, even at those sites where assessments have been conducted.  Accordingly, we may discover previously unknown environmental conditions and the cost of remediating such conditions may be material.  See Legal Proceedings below and Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, we may be required to comply with evolving environmental, health and safety laws, regulations or requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future or to address newly discovered information or conditions that require a response. In particular, climate change is receiving increased attention worldwide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions.  The U.S. Congress has considered climate change-related legislation and may retake the issue in the near future.  Specific policy measures could include cap and trade provisions or a carbon tax. The European Union has instituted the Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading System (EU-ETS).  Our manufacturing plants use energy, including electricity and natural gas, and some of our plants may in the future emit amounts of greenhouse gas that could be affected by these legislative and regulatory efforts. Potential consequences could include increased energy, transportation and raw material costs and may require the Company to make additional investments in its facilities and equipment or limit our ability to grow. Our forward-looking statements and projections may turn out to be inaccurate. This Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  These statements relate to analyses and other information that are based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable.  These statements also relate to future prospects, developments and business strategies.  These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as anticipate, believe, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, predict, project, should, would, will and similar terms and phrases, including references to assumptions.  Such statements are based on current expectations, are inherently uncertain, and are subject to changing assumptions. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: (a) the estimates and expectations based on aircraft production rates made publicly available by Airbus and Boeing; (b) the revenues we may generate from an aircraft model or program; (c) the impact of the possible push-out in deliveries of the Airbus and Boeing backlog and the impact of delays in the startup or ramp-up of new aircraft programs or the final Hexcel composite material content once the design and material selection has been completed; 12 (d) expectations of composite content on new commercial aircraft programs and our share of those requirements; (e) expectations of growth in revenues from space and defense applications, including whether certain programs might be curtailed or discontinued; (f) expectations regarding growth in sales for wind energy, recreation and other industrial applications; (g) expectations regarding working capital trends and expenditures; (h) expectations as to the level of capital expenditures and when we will complete the construction and qualification of capacity expansions; (i) our ability to maintain and improve margins in light of the ramp-up of capacity and new facilities and the current economic environment; (j) the outcome of legal matters; (k) our projections regarding the realizability of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards; and (l) the impact of various market risks, including fluctuations in interest rates, currency exchange rates, environmental regulations and tax codes, fluctuations in commodity prices, and fluctuations in the market price of our common stock, the impact of work stoppages or other labor disruptions and the impact of the above factors on our expectations of 2013 financial results.  In addition, actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward looking statements due to a variety of factors, including but not limited to changing market conditions, increased competition, product mix, inability to achieve planned manufacturing improvements, cost reductions and capacity additions, and conditions in the financial markets. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the following: changes in general economic and business conditions; changes in current pricing and cost levels; changes in political, social and economic conditions and local regulations; foreign currency fluctuations; changes in aerospace delivery rates; reductions in sales to any significant customers, particularly Airbus, Boeing or Vestas; changes in sales mix; changes in government defense procurement budgets; changes in military aerospace programs technology; industry capacity; competition; disruptions of established supply channels, particularly where raw materials are obtained from a single or limited number of sources and cannot be substituted by unqualified alternatives; manufacturing capacity constraints; unforeseen vulnerability of our network and systems to interruptions or failures; and the availability, terms and deployment of capital. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those expected, estimated or projected.  In addition to other factors that affect our operating results and financial position, neither past financial performance nor our expectations should be considered reliable indicators of future performance.  Investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.  Further, our stock price is subject to volatility.  Any of the factors discussed above could have an adverse impact on our stock price.  In addition, failure of sales or income in any quarter to meet the investment communitys expectations, as well as broader market trends, can have an adverse impact on our stock price.  We do not undertake an obligation to update our forward-looking statements or risk factors to reflect future events or circumstances. "
2,HXL,HEXCEL CORP,2012-02-07,"ITEM 1A. Risk Factors
 An investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties.  You should consider the following risk factors carefully, in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase any of our securities. The markets in which we operate can be cyclical, and downturns in them may adversely affect the results of our operations. Some of the markets in which we operate have been, to varying degrees, cyclical and have experienced downturns.  A downturn in these markets could occur at any time as a result of events that are industry specific or macroeconomic and in the event of a downturn, we have no way of knowing if, when and to what extent there might be a recovery.  Any deterioration in any of the cyclical markets we serve could adversely affect our financial performance and operating results. At December 31, 2011, Airbus and Boeing had a combined backlog of 8,208 aircraft, which is about eight years of production at current delivery rates.  To the extent any significant deferrals, cancellations or reduction in demand results in decreased aircraft build rates, it would reduce net sales for our Commercial Aerospace products and as a result reduce our operating income.  Approximately 59% of our net sales for 2011 were derived from sales to the Commercial Aerospace industry, which includes 82% from Airbus and Boeing aircraft and 18% from regional and business aircraft.  Reductions in demand for commercial aircraft or a delay in deliveries could result from many factors, including terrorist events and any subsequent military response, changes in the propensity for the general public to travel by air, a rise in the cost of aviation fuel, a change in technology resulting in the use of alternative materials, consolidation and liquidation of airlines, availability of funding for new aircraft purchases or leases, inventory corrections or disruptions throughout the supply chain and slower macroeconomic growth.  Both Airbus and Boeing have experienced various delays in their newest aircraft programs, including the A380, B787, B747-8, A400M, and A350.  These delays have delayed and may continue to delay our expected growth or our effective utilization of capacity installed for such growth.  Future delays in these or other major new customer programs could similarly impact our results. In addition, our customers continue to emphasize the need for cost reduction or other improvements in contract terms throughout the supply chain.  In response to these pressures, we may be required to accept increased risk or face the prospects of margin compression on some products in the future. Where possible, we seek to offset or mitigate the impact of such pressures through productivity and performance improvements, index clauses, currency hedging and other actions. 10 A significant decline in business with Boeing, EADS, Vestas, or other significant customers could materially impact our business, operating results, prospects and financial condition. We have concentrated customers in the Commercial Aerospace and wind energy markets.  In the Commercial Aerospace market, approximately 82%, and in the Space & Defense market, approximately 35%, of our 2011 net sales were made to Boeing and EADS (including Airbus) and their related subcontractors.  For the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, approximately 29% and 31% of our total consolidated net sales were to Boeing and its related subcontractors, respectively, and approximately 28% and 24% of our total consolidated net sales, respectively, were to EADS, including Airbus and its related subcontractors.  In the wind energy market, our primary customer is Vestas Wind Systems A/S.  Significant changes in the demand for our customers end products, the share of their requirements that is awarded to us or changes in the design or materials used to construct their products could result in a significant loss of business with these customers.  The loss of, or significant reduction in purchases by, Boeing, EADS and Vestas or any of our other significant customers could materially impair our business, operating results, prospects and financial condition.  The level of purchases by our customers is often affected by events beyond their control, including general economic conditions, demand for their products, business disruptions, disruptions in deliveries, strikes and other factors. Reductions in space and defense spending could result in a decline in our net sales. The growth in military aircraft production that has occurred in recent years may not be sustained, individual programs important to Hexcel may be cancelled, production may not continue to grow and the increased demand for replacement helicopter blades may not continue. The production of military aircraft depends upon defense budgets and the related demand for defense and related equipment. Approximately 23% of our net sales in 2011 were derived from space and defense industries. A decrease in supply, interruptions at key facilities or an increase in cost of raw materials could result in a material decline in our profitability. Our profitability depends largely on the price and continuity of supply of raw materials, which may be supplied through a sole source or a limited number of sources.  We purchase large volumes of raw materials, such as epoxy and phenolic resins, carbon fiber, fiberglass yarn, aluminum foil and aramid paper.  Any restrictions on the supply, or an increase in the cost, of our raw materials could significantly reduce our profit margins.  Efforts to mitigate restrictions on the supply or price increases of these raw materials by long-term purchase agreements, productivity improvements or by passing cost increases to our customers may not be successful. The occurrence of material operational problems, including but not limited to failure of, or interruption to, key equipment or natural disasters, may have a material adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility. With respect to certain facilities, such events could have a material effect on our company as a whole. We have substantial international operations subject to uncertainties which could affect our operating results. We believe that revenue from sales outside the U.S. will continue to account for a material portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future.  In 2011, 48% of our production and 56% of our customer sales occurred outside of the United States.  Additionally, we have invested significant resources in our international operations and we intend to continue to make such investments in the future. Our international operations are subject to numerous risks, including: (a) general economic and political conditions in the countries where we operate may have an adverse effect on our operations in those countries or not be favorable to our growth strategy; (b) the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through some foreign legal systems; (c) foreign customers may have longer payment cycles than customers in the U.S.; (d) cost of compliance with international trade laws of all of the countries in which we do business, including export control laws, relating to sales and purchases of goods and equipment and transfers of technology; (e) tax rates in some foreign countries may exceed those of the U.S. and foreign earnings may be subject to withholding requirements or the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions; governments may adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on our business and market opportunities; and (f) the potential difficulty in enforcing our intellectual property rights in some foreign countries, and the potential for the intellectual property rights of others to affect our ability to sell product in certain markets.  Any one of these could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may influence the profitability and cash flows of our business.  For example, our European operations sell a portion of the products they produce in U.S. dollars, yet the labor, overhead costs and portions of material costs incurred in the manufacture of those products are denominated in Euros, British pounds sterling or U.S. dollars. As a result, the local currency margins of goods manufactured with costs denominated in local currency, yet sold in U.S. dollars, will vary with fluctuations in currency exchange rates, reducing when the U.S. dollar weakens against the Euro and British pound sterling. In addition, the reported U.S. dollar value of the local currency financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries will vary with fluctuations in currency exchange rates. While we enter into currency exchange and hedge agreements from time to time to mitigate these types of 11 fluctuations, we cannot remove all fluctuations or hedge all exposures, and our earnings are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates. We currently do not have political risk insurance in the countries in which we conduct business. While we carefully consider these risks when evaluating our international operations we cannot provide assurance that we will not be materially adversely affected as a result of such risks. We could be adversely affected by environmental and safety requirements. Our operations require the handling, use, storage and disposal of certain regulated materials and wastes. As a result, we are subject to various laws and regulations pertaining to pollution and protection of the environment, health and safety.  These requirements govern, among other things, emissions to air, discharge to waters and the generation, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of waste and remediation of contaminated sites.  We have made, and will continue to make, capital and other expenditures in order to comply with these laws and regulations.  These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become more stringent in the future. We have been named as a potentially responsible party under the U.S. Superfund law or similar state laws at several sites requiring clean up. These laws generally impose liability for costs to investigate and remediate contamination without regard to fault. Under certain circumstances liability may be joint and several, resulting in one responsible party being held responsible for the entire obligation.  Liability may also include damages to natural resources.  We have incurred and likely will continue to incur expenses to investigate and clean up certain of our existing and former facilities, for which we believe we have adequate reserves.  The ongoing operation of our manufacturing plants also entails environmental risks, and we may incur material costs or liabilities in the future which could adversely affect us. Although most of our properties have been the subject of environmental site assessments, there can be no assurance that all potential instances of soil and groundwater contamination have been identified, even at those sites where assessments have been conducted. Accordingly, we may discover previously unknown environmental conditions and the cost of remediating such conditions may be material.  See Legal Proceedings below and Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, we may be required to comply with evolving environmental, health and safety laws, regulations or requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future or to address newly discovered information or conditions that require a response. In particular, climate change is receiving increased attention worldwide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions.  The U.S. Congress is currently considering climate change-related legislation which may include cap and trade provisions or a carbon tax. The European Union has instituted the Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading System (EU-ETS). Our manufacturing plants use energy, including electricity and natural gas, and certain of our plants emit amounts of greenhouse gas that may be affected by these legislative and regulatory efforts.  It is difficult at this time to estimate the likelihood of passage, or predict the potential impact, of any additional legislation. Potential consequences could include increased energy, transportation and raw material costs and may require the Company to make additional investments in its facilities and equipment or limit our ability to grow. Our forward-looking statements and projections may turn out to be inaccurate. This Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  These statements relate to analyses and other information that are based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable.  These statements also relate to future prospects, developments and business strategies.  These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as anticipate, believe, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, predict, project, should, would, will and similar terms and phrases, including references to assumptions.  Such statements are based on current expectations, are inherently uncertain, and are subject to changing assumptions. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: (a) the estimates and expectations based on aircraft production rates made publicly available by Airbus and Boeing; (b) the revenues we may generate from an aircraft model or program; (c)  the impact of the possible push-out in deliveries of the Airbus and Boeing backlog and the impact of delays in new aircraft programs or the final Hexcel composite material content once the design and material selection has been completed; (d) expectations of composite content on new commercial aircraft programs and our share of those requirements; (e) expectations of growth in revenues from space and defense applications, including whether certain programs might be curtailed or discontinued; (f) expectations regarding growth in sales for wind energy, recreation and other industrial applications; (g) expectations regarding working capital trends and expenditures; (h) expectations as to the level of capital expenditures and when we will complete the construction and qualification of 12 capacity expansions; (i) our ability to maintain and improve margins in light of the ramp-up of capacity and new facilities and the current economic environment; (j) the outcome of legal matters; (k) our projections regarding the realizability of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards; and (l) the impact of various market risks, including fluctuations in interest rates, currency exchange rates, environmental regulations and tax codes, fluctuations in commodity prices, and fluctuations in the market price of our common stock and the impact of the above factors on our expectations of 2012 financial results.  In addition, actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward looking statements due to a variety of factors, including but not limited to changing market conditions, increased competition, product mix, inability to achieve planned manufacturing improvements, cost reductions and capacity additions, and conditions in the financial markets. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the following: changes in general economic and business conditions; changes in current pricing and cost levels; changes in political, social and economic conditions and local regulations, particularly in Asia and Europe; foreign currency fluctuations; changes in aerospace delivery rates; reductions in sales to any significant customers, particularly Airbus, Boeing or Vestas; changes in sales mix; changes in government defense procurement budgets; changes in military aerospace programs technology; industry capacity; competition; disruptions of established supply channels, particularly where raw materials are obtained from a single or limited number of sources and cannot be substituted by unqualified alternatives; manufacturing capacity constraints; and the availability, terms and deployment of capital. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those expected, estimated or projected.  In addition to other factors that affect our operating results and financial position, neither past financial performance nor our expectations should be considered reliable indicators of future performance.  Investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.  Further, our stock price is subject to volatility.  Any of the factors discussed above could have an adverse impact on our stock price.  In addition, failure of sales or income in any quarter to meet the investment communitys expectations, as well as broader market trends, can have an adverse impact on our stock price.  We do not undertake an obligation to update our forward-looking statements or risk factors to reflect future events or circumstances. "
1,HXL,HEXCEL CORP,2011-02-10,"ITEM 1A. Risk Factors
 An investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties.  You should consider the following risk factors carefully, in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase any of our securities. The markets in which we operate can be cyclical, and downturns in them may adversely affect the results of our operations. Some of the markets in which we operate have been, to varying degrees, cyclical and have experienced downturns.  A downturn in these markets could occur at any time as a result of events that are  industry specific or macroeconomic, such as the recent financial and credit crisis; and in the event of a downturn, we have no way of knowing if, when and to what extent there might be a recovery.  Any deterioration in any of the cyclical markets we serve could adversely affect our financial performance and operating results. At December 31, 2010, Airbus and Boeing had a combined backlog of 6,995 aircraft, which is about seven years of production at current delivery rates.   To the extent any significant deferrals, cancellations or reduction in demand results in decreased aircraft build rates, it would reduce net sales for our Commercial Aerospace products and as a result reduce our operating income.  Approximately 55% of our net sales for 2010 were derived from sales to the Commercial Aerospace industry, which includes 83% from Airbus and Boeing aircraft and 17% from regional and business jets.  Reductions in demand for commercial aircraft or a delay in deliveries could result from many factors, including terrorist events and any subsequent military response, changes in the propensity for the general public to travel by air, a rise in the cost of aviation fuel, a change in technology resulting in the use of alternative materials, consolidation and liquidation of airlines, availability of funding for new aircraft purchases or leases, inventory corrections throughout the supply chain and slower macroeconomic growth.  Both Boeing and Airbus have experienced various delays in their newest aircraft programs, including the Boeing 787, 747-8, A400M and the ramp-up of the Airbus A380.  These delays have delayed and may continue to delay our expected growth or our effective utilization of capacity installed for such growth.  Future delays in these or other major new customer programs could similarly impact our results. In addition, our customers continue to emphasize the need for cost reduction or other improvements in contract terms throughout the supply chain.  In response to these pressures, we may be required to accept increased risk or face the prospects of margin compression on some products in the future. Where possible, we seek to offset or mitigate the impact of such pressures through productivity and performance improvements, index clauses, currency hedging and other actions. A significant decline in business with Boeing, EADS, Vestas, or other significant customers could materially impact our business, operating results, prospects and financial condition. We have concentrated customers in the Commercial Aerospace and wind energy markets.  In the Commercial Aerospace market, approximately 83%, and in the Space & Defense market, approximately 35%, of our 2010 net sales were made to Boeing and EADS (including Airbus) and their related subcontractors.  For the years ended December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, approximately 31% and 27% of our total consolidated net sales was made to Boeing and its related subcontractors, respectively, and approximately 24% and 22% of our total consolidated net sales, respectively, was made to EADS, including Airbus and its related subcontractors.  In the wind energy market, our primary customer is Vestas Wind Systems A/S.  Significant changes in the demand for our customers end products, the share of their requirements that is awarded to us or changes in the design or materials used to construct their products could result in a significant loss of business with these customers.  The loss of, or significant reduction in purchases by, Boeing, EADS and Vestas or any of our other significant customers could materially impair our business, operating results, prospects 10 and financial condition.  The level of purchases by our customers is often affected by events beyond their control, including general economic conditions, demand for their products, business disruptions, disruptions in deliveries, strikes and other factors. Reductions in space and defense spending could result in a decline in our net sales. The growth in military aircraft production that has occurred in recent years may not be sustained, individual programs important to Hexcel may be cancelled, production may not continue to grow and the increased demand for replacement helicopter blades may not continue. The production of military aircraft depends upon defense budgets and the related demand for defense and related equipment. Approximately 26% of our net sales in 2010 were derived from space and defense industries. A decrease in supply, interruptions at key facilities or an increase in cost of raw materials could result in a material decline in our profitability. Our profitability depends largely on the price and continuity of supply of raw materials, which are supplied through a sole source or a limited number of sources.  We purchase large volumes of raw materials, such as epoxy and phenolic resins, aluminum foil, carbon fiber, fiberglass yarn and aramid paper.  Any restrictions on the supply, or an increase in the cost, of our raw materials could significantly reduce our profit margins.  Efforts to mitigate restrictions on the supply or price increases of these raw materials by long-term purchase agreements, productivity improvements or by passing cost increases to our customers may not be successful. The occurrence of material operational problems, including but not limited to failure of, or interruption to, key equipment or natural disasters, may have a material adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility. With respect to certain facilities, such events could have a material effect on our company as a whole. We have substantial international operations subject to uncertainties which could affect our operating results. We believe that revenue from sales outside the U.S. will continue to account for a material portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future.  Additionally, we have invested significant resources in our international operations and we intend to continue to make such investments in the future. Our international operations are subject to numerous risks, including: ·              the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through some foreign legal systems; ·              foreign customers may have longer payment cycles than customers in the U.S.; ·              cost of compliance with international trade laws of all of the countries in which we do business, including export control laws, relating to sales and purchases of goods and equipment and transfers of technology; ·              tax rates in some foreign countries may exceed those of the U.S. and foreign earnings may be subject to withholding requirements or the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions; ·              general economic and political conditions in the countries where we operate may have an adverse effect on our operations in those countries or not be favorable to our growth strategy; ·              governments may adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on our business and market opportunities; and ·              the potential difficulty in enforcing our intellectual property rights in some foreign countries, and the potential for the intellectual property rights of others to affect our ability to sell product in certain markets. Any one of the above could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may influence the profitability and cash flows of our business.  For example, our European operations sell some of the products they produce in U.S. dollars, yet the labor, overhead costs and portions of material costs incurred in the manufacture of those products are denominated in Euros or British pounds sterling. As a result, the local currency margins of goods manufactured with costs denominated in local currency, yet sold in U.S. dollars, will vary with fluctuations in currency exchange rates, reducing when the U.S. dollar weakens against the Euro and British pound sterling. In addition, the reported U.S. dollar value of the local currency financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries will vary with fluctuations in currency exchange rates. While we enter into currency exchange and hedge agreements from time to time to mitigate these types of fluctuations, we cannot remove all fluctuations or hedge all exposures, and our earnings are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates. During the past several years, some countries in which we operate or plan to operate have been characterized by varying degrees 11 of inflation and uneven growth rates. We currently do not have political risk insurance in the countries in which we conduct business. While we carefully consider these risks when evaluating our international operations we cannot provide assurance that we will not be materially adversely affected as a result of such risks. We could be adversely affected by environmental and safety requirements. Our operations require the handling, use, storage and disposal of certain regulated materials and wastes. As a result, we are subject to various laws and regulations pertaining to pollution and protection of the environment, health and safety.  These requirements govern, among other things, emissions to air, discharge to waters and the generation, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of waste and remediation of contaminated sites.  We have made, and will continue to make, capital and other expenditures in order to comply with these laws and regulations.  These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become more stringent in the future. We have been named as a potentially responsible party under the U.S. Superfund law or similar state laws at several sites requiring clean up. These laws generally impose liability for costs to investigate and remediate contamination without regard to fault. Under certain circumstances liability may be joint and several, resulting in one responsible party being held responsible for the entire obligation.  Liability may also include damages to natural resources.  In connection with our Lodi, New Jersey facility, Hexcel, along with a number of other companies, has been directed by federal regulatory authorities to contribute to the assessment and restoration of a stretch of the Passaic River, a project currently estimated to cost $900 million to $2.3 billion.  We have also incurred and likely will continue to incur expenses to investigate and clean up certain of our existing and former facilities, for which we believe we have adequate reserves.  The ongoing operation of our manufacturing plants also entails environmental risks, and we may incur material costs or liabilities in the future which could adversely affect us. Although most of our properties have been the subject of environmental site assessments, there can be no assurance that all potential instances of soil and groundwater contamination have been identified, even at those sites where assessments have been conducted. Accordingly, we may discover previously unknown environmental conditions and the cost of remediating such conditions may be material.  See Legal Proceedings below and Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, we may be required to comply with evolving environmental, health and safety laws, regulations or requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future or to address newly discovered information or conditions that require a response. In particular, climate change is receiving increased attention worldwide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions.  The U.S. Congress is currently considering climate change-related legislation which may include cap and trade provisions or a carbon tax. The European Union has instituted the Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading System (EU-ETS). Our manufacturing plants use energy, including electricity and natural gas, and certain of our plants emit amounts of greenhouse gas that may be affected by these legislative and regulatory efforts.  It is difficult at this time to estimate the likelihood of passage, or predict the potential impact, of any additional legislation. Potential consequences could include increased energy, transportation and raw material costs and may require the Company to make additional investments in its facilities and equipment or limit our ability to grow. Our forward-looking statements and projections may turn out to be inaccurate. This Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  These statements relate to analyses and other information that are based on forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable.  These statements also relate to future prospects, developments and business strategies.  These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as anticipate, believe, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, predict, project, should, would, will, and similar terms and phrases, including references to assumptions.  Such statements are based on current expectations, are inherently uncertain, and are subject to changing assumptions. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: (a) the estimates and expectations based on aircraft production rates made publicly available by Airbus and Boeing; (b) the revenues we may generate from an aircraft model or program; (c)  the impact of the possible push-out in deliveries of the Airbus and Boeing backlog and the impact of delays in new aircraft programs or the final Hexcel composite material content once the design and material selection has been completed; (d) expectations of composite content on new commercial aircraft programs and our share of those requirements; (e) expectations of growth in revenues from space and defense applications, including whether certain programs might be curtailed or discontinued; (f) expectations regarding growth in sales for wind energy, recreation and other industrial applications; (g) expectations regarding working capital trends and expenditures; (h) expectations as to the level of capital expenditures and when we will complete the construction and qualification of capacity expansions; (i) our ability to maintain and improve margins in light of the ramp-up of capacity and the current economic environment; (j) the outcome of legal matters; (k) our projections regarding the realizability of net operating loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards, and the impact of the above factors on our expectations of 2011 financial results; and (l) the impact of various market risks, including fluctuations in interest rates, currency exchange rates, environmental regulations and tax codes, fluctuations in commodity prices, and fluctuations in the market price of our common stock.  In addition, actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward looking statements due to a variety of factors, including but not limited to changing market 12 conditions, increased competition, product mix, inability to achieve planned manufacturing improvements and cost reductions, and conditions in the financial markets. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different.

5,HXL,HEXCEL CORP,2010-02-10,"ITEM 1A. Risk Factors
 An investment in ourcommon stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties.  You should consider the following riskfactors carefully, in addition to the other information contained in thisAnnual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase any of oursecurities. Adversemacroeconomic and business conditions, as well as continued disruption incredit markets and government policy changes may significantly and negativelyimpact our revenues, profitability and financial condition. Economic conditions in theUnited States and in foreign markets in which we operate could substantiallyaffect our sales and profitability. Economic activity in the United States and throughout much of the worldhas undergone sudden, sharp changes. Global credit and capital markets have experienced unprecedentedvolatility and disruption, which periodically has caused large fluctuations inthe access and cost of liquidity around the world. Some of our suppliers,customers and counterparties could face adverse liquidity issues.  General concerns about the fundamentalsoundness of domestic and foreign economies may also cause customers to reduce theirpurchases. Changes in governmentalbanking, monetary and fiscal policies to stabilize liquidity and increasecredit availability may not be effective. It is difficult to determine the extent of the economic and financialmarket problems and the many ways in which they may affect our suppliers,customers and our business in general. Continuation or further deterioration ofthese financial and macroeconomic conditions could have a significant adverseeffect on our sales, profitability and results of operations. The markets in which we operate can be cyclical, anddownturns in them may adversely affect the results of our operations. Some of the markets in which we operate have been,to varying degrees, cyclical and have experienced downturns.  A downturn in these markets could occur atany time, and in the event of a downturn, we have no way of knowing if, whenand to what extent there might be a recovery. Any deterioration in any of the cyclical markets we serve couldadversely affect our financial performance and operating results. At December 31, 2009, Boeing and Airbus had a combinedbacklog of 6,863 aircraft, which is about seven years of production at 2009record deliveries.   To the extent any significantdeferrals, cancellations or reduction in demand results in decreased aircraft 10 buildrates, it would reduce net sales for our Commercial Aerospace products and as aresult reduce our operating income. Approximately 50% of our net sales for 2009 were derived from sales tothe Commercial Aerospace industry, which includes 78% from Airbus and Boeingaircraft and 22% from regional and business jets.  Reductions in demand for commercial aircraftor a delay in deliveries could result from many factors, including a terroristevent similar to that which occurred on September 11, 2001 and anysubsequent military response, changes in the propensity for the general publicto travel by air, a rise in the cost of aviation fuel, a change in technologyresulting in the use of alternative materials, consolidation and liquidation ofairlines, availability of funding for new aircraft purchases or leases andslower macroeconomic growth.  Both Boeingand Airbus have experienced various delays in their newest aircraft programs,including the Boeing 787, 747-8, A400M and the ramp-up of the Airbus A380.  These delays have delayed and may continue todelay our expected growth or our effective utilization of capacity installedfor such growth.  Future delays in theseor other major Boeing or Airbus programs could similarly impact our results. In addition, our customers continue to emphasize theneed for cost reduction or other improvements in contract terms throughout thesupply chain.  In response to thesepressures, we may be required to accept increased risk or face the prospects ofmargin compression on some products in the future. Where possible, we seek tooffset or mitigate the impact of such pressures through productivity andperformance improvements, index clauses, currency hedging and other actions. A significant decline in business with Boeing, EADS,Vestas, or other significant customers could materially impact our business,operating results, prospects and financial condition. We have concentrated customers in the CommercialAerospace and wind energy markets.  Inthe Commercial Aerospace market, approximately 78%, and in the Space andDefense market, approximately 36%, of our 2009 net sales were made to Boeingand EADS (including Airbus) and their related subcontractors.  For the years ended December 31, 2009and December 31, 2008, approximately 27% and 23% of our total consolidatednet sales was made to Boeing and its related subcontractors, respectively, andapproximately 22% and 24% of our total consolidated net sales, respectively,was made to EADS, including Airbus and its related subcontractors.  In the wind energy market, nearly 12% of ourtotal sales in 2009 and 11% in 2008 were made to Vestas Wind Systems A/S.  Significant changes in the demand for ourcustomers end products, the share of their requirements that is awarded to usor changes in the design or materials used to construct their products couldresult in a significant loss of business with these customers.  The loss of, or significant reduction inpurchases by, Boeing, EADS and Vestas or any of our other significant customerscould materially impair our business, operating results, prospects andfinancial condition.  The level ofpurchases by our customers is often affected by events beyond their control,including general economic conditions, demand for their products, businessdisruptions, disruptions in deliveries, strikes and other factors. Reductions in space and defense spending could resultin a decline in our net sales. The growth in military aircraft production that hasoccurred in recent years may not be sustained, individual programsimportant to Hexcel may be cancelled, production may not continue to growand the increased demand for replacement helicopter blades may notcontinue. The production of military aircraft depends upon defense budgets andthe related demand for defense and related equipment. Approximately 27% of ournet sales in 2009 were derived from space and defense industries. A decrease in supply or increase in cost of rawmaterials could result in a material decline in our profitability. Our profitability dependslargely on the price and continuity of supply of raw materials, which aresupplied through a sole source or a limited number of sources.  We purchase large volumes of raw materials,such as epoxy and phenolic resins, aluminum foil, carbon fiber, fiberglass yarnand aramid paper.  Any restrictions onthe supply, or an increase in the cost, of our raw materials couldsignificantly reduce our profit margins. Efforts to mitigate restrictions on the supply or price increases ofthese raw materials by long-term purchase agreements, productivity improvementsor by passing cost increases to our customers may not be successful. We have substantial international operations subjectto uncertainties which could affect our operating results. We believe that revenue from sales outside the U.S.will continue to account for a material portion of our total revenue for theforeseeable future.  Additionally, wehave invested significant resources in our international operations and weintend to continue to make such investments in the future. Our internationaloperations are subject to numerous risks, including: 11 ·              the difficulty of enforcingagreements and collecting receivables through some foreign legal systems; ·              foreign customersmay have longer payment cycles than customers in the U.S.; ·              cost of compliance withinternational trade laws of all of the countries in which we do business,including export control laws, relating to sales and purchases of goods andequipment and transfers of technology; ·              tax rates in some foreigncountries may exceed those of the U.S. and foreign earnings may besubject to withholding requirements or the imposition of tariffs, exchangecontrols or other restrictions; ·              general economic andpolitical conditions in the countries where we operate may have an adverseeffect on our operations in those countries or not be favorable to our growthstrategy; ·              governments may adoptregulations or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverseimpact on our business and market opportunities; and ·              the potential difficulty inenforcing our intellectual property rights in some foreign countries, and thepotential for the intellectual property rights of others to affect our abilityto sell product in certain markets. Any one of the above could adversely affect ourfinancial condition and results of operations. In addition, fluctuations in currency exchange ratesmay influence the profitability and cash flows of our business.  For example, our European operations sellsome of the products they produce in U.S. dollars, yet the labor, overheadcosts and portions of material costs incurred in the manufacture of thoseproducts is denominated in Euros or British pounds sterling. As a result, thelocal currency margins of goods manufactured with costs denominated in localcurrency, yet sold in U.S. dollars, will vary with fluctuations in currencyexchange rates, reducing when the U.S. dollar weakens against the Euro andBritish pound sterling. In addition, the reported U.S. dollar value of thelocal currency financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries will vary withfluctuations in currency exchange rates. While we enter into currency exchangeand hedge agreements from time to time to mitigate these types of fluctuations,we cannot remove all fluctuations or hedge all exposures, and our earnings areimpacted by changes in currency exchange rates. During the past several years, some countries inwhich we operate or plan to operate have been characterized by varying degreesof inflation and uneven growth rates. We currently do not have political riskinsurance in the countries in which we conduct business. While we carefullyconsider these risks when evaluating our international operations we cannotprovide assurance that we will not be materially adversely affected as a resultof such risks. We could be adversely affected by environmental andsafety requirements. Our operations require the handling, use, storageand disposal of certain regulated materials and wastes. As a result, we aresubject to various laws and regulations pertaining to pollution and protectionof the environment, health and safety. These requirements govern, among other things, emissions to air,discharge to waters and the generation, handling, storage, treatment anddisposal of waste and remediation of contaminated sites.  We have made, and will continue to make,capital and other expenditures in order to comply with these laws andregulations.  These laws and regulationsare complex, change frequently and could become more stringent in the future. We have been named as a potentially responsibleparty under the U.S. Superfund law or similar state laws at several sitesrequiring clean up. These laws generally impose liability for costs toinvestigate and remediate contamination without regard to fault. Under certaincircumstances liability may be joint and several, resulting in oneresponsible party being held responsible for the entire obligation.  Liability may also include damages tonatural resources.  In connection withour Lodi, New Jersey facility, Hexcel, along with a number of other companies,has been directed by federal regulatory authorities to contribute to theassessment and restoration of a stretch of the Passaic River, a projectcurrently estimated to cost $900 million to $2.3 billion.  We have also incurred and likely willcontinue to incur expenses to investigate and clean up certain of our existingand former facilities, for which we believe we have adequate reserves.  The ongoing operation of our manufacturingplants also entails environmental risks, and we may incur material costsor liabilities in the future which could adversely affect us. In addition, we may be required to comply withevolving environmental, health and safety laws, regulations or requirementsthat may be adopted or imposed in the future or to address newlydiscovered information or conditions that require a response.  Although most of our properties have been thesubject of environmental site assessments, there can be no assurance that allpotential instances of soil and groundwater contamination have been identified,even at those sites where assessments have been conducted. Accordingly,  12 wemay discover previously unknown environmental conditions and the cost ofremediating such conditions may be material.  See Legal Proceedings below and Note 14 tothe consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Reporton Form 10-K. Our forward-looking statements and projections may turn out to beinaccurate. ThisForm 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of thePrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  These statements relate to analyses and otherinformation that are based on forecasts of future results and estimates ofamounts not yet determinable.  Thesestatements also relate to future prospects, developments and business strategies.  These forward-looking statements areidentified by their use of terms and phrases such as anticipate, believe, could,estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, predict, project, should, will,and similar terms and phrases, including references to assumptions.  Such statements are based on currentexpectations, are inherently uncertain, and are subject to changingassumptions.  Such forward-lookingstatements include, but are not limited to: (a) the estimates andexpectations based on aircraft production rates made publicly available byBoeing and Airbus;

 An investment in ourcommon stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties.  You should consider the following riskfactors carefully, in addition to the other information contained in thisAnnual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase any of oursecurities. Adverse macroeconomic and business conditions, aswell as continued disruption in credit markets and government policy changesmay significantly and negatively affect our revenues, profitability andfinancial condition. Economicconditions in the United States and in foreign markets in which we operatecould substantially affect our sales and profitability. Economic activity inthe United States and throughout much of the world has undergone a sudden,sharp economic downturn. Global credit and capital markets have experiencedunprecedented volatility and disruption. Business credit and liquidity havetightened in much of the world. Some of our suppliers, customers andcounterparties could face adverse liquidity issues.  General concerns about the fundamentalsoundness of domestic and foreign economies may also cause customers to reducetheir purchases. 11Tableof Contents Changesin governmental banking, monetary and fiscal policies to restore liquidity andincrease credit availability may not be effective. It is difficult to determinethe extent of the economic and financial market problems and the many ways inwhich they may affect our suppliers, customers and our business in general.Continuation or further deterioration of these financial and macroeconomicconditions could have a significant adverse effect on our sales, profitabilityand results of operations. The markets in which we operate can be cyclical, anddownturns in them may adversely affect the results of our operations. Some of the markets in which we operate have been,to varying degrees, cyclical and have experienced downturns.  A downturn in these markets could occur atany time, and in the event of a downturn, we have no way of knowing if, whenand to what extent there might be a recovery. Any deterioration in any of thecyclical markets we serve could adversely affect our financial performance andoperating results. While Boeing and Airbus had three prior yearsof record orders and 2008 orders were still 70% more than the 2008 combineddeliveries (resulting in a record combined backlog of 7,429 aircraft as of December 31,2008), to the extent anysignificant deferrals, cancellations or reduction in demand results indecreased aircraft build rates, reduced net sales for our commercial aerospaceproducts and could reduce our operating income. Approximately 54% of our netsales for 2008 were derived from sales to the commercial aerospace industry.Reductions in demand for commercial aircraft or a delay in deliveries couldresult from many factors, including a terrorist event similar to that whichoccurred on September 11, 2001 and any subsequent military response,changes in the propensity for the general public to travel by air, a rise inthe cost of aviation fuel, a change in technology resulting in the use ofalternative materials, consolidation and liquidation of airlines, availabilityof funding for new aircraft purchases or leases and slower macroeconomicgrowth.  Both Boeing and Airbus haveexperienced various delays in their newest aircraft programs, including theBoeing 787, 747-8, A400M and the ramp-up of the Airbus A380.  These delays have or could have delayed ourexpected growth or our effective utilization of capacity installed for suchgrowth.  Future delays in these or othermajor Boeing or Airbus programs could similarly impact our results. In addition, our customers continue to emphasize theneed for cost reduction or other improvements in contract terms throughout thesupply chain.  In response to thesepressures, we may be required to accept increased risk or face the prospects ofmargin compression on some products in the future. Where possible, we seek tooffset or mitigate the impact of such pressures through productivity andperformance improvements, index clauses, currency hedging and other actions. A significant decline in business with Boeing, EADS,Vestas, or other significant customers could materially impact our business,operating results, prospects and financial condition. We have concentrated customers in the commercialaerospace and wind energy markets.  Inthe commercial aerospace market, approximately 72%, and in the space anddefense market, approximately 38%, of our 2008 net sales were made to Boeingand EADS (including Airbus) and their related subcontractors.  For the years ended December 31, 2008and December 31, 2007, approximately 23% and 25% of our total consolidatednet sales was made to Boeing and its related subcontractors, respectively, andapproximately 24% and 22% of our total consolidated net sales, respectively,was made to EADS, including Airbus and its related subcontractors.  In the wind energy market, nearly 11% of ourtotal sales (but less than 10% in 2007) were made to Vestas Wind Systems A/S.  Significant changes in the demand for ourcustomers end products, the share of their requirements that is awarded to usor changes in the design or materials used to construct their products couldresult in a significant loss of business with these customers.  The loss of, or significant reduction inpurchases by, Boeing, EADS and Vestas or any of our 12Tableof Contents othersignificant customers could materially impair our business, operating results,prospects and financial condition.  Thelevel of purchases by our customers is often affected by events beyond theircontrol, including general economic conditions, demand for their products,business disruptions, disruptions in deliveries, strikes and other factors. Reductions in space and defense spending could resultin a decline in our net sales. The growth in military aircraft production that hasoccurred in recent years may not be sustained, individual programsimportant to Hexcel may be cancelled, production may not continue to grownor may the increased demand for replacement helicopter blades continue.The production of military aircraft depends upon defense budgets and therelated demand for defense and related equipment. Approximately 23% of our netsales in 2008 were derived from space and defense industries. Changes to the capital expansion plans couldmaterially impact our operating results and financial condition. The company has significantly increased its capitalexpenditures in recent years, including capital expenditure spending of $177.3million in 2008, $120.6 million in 2007 and $117.9 million in 2006. During that period, major projects in progress or completed includecarbon fiber lines in Salt Lake City, Utah and Spain, precursor lines inDecatur, Alabama, satellite prepreg plants in Germany and France and additionalwind energy capacity in Austria and a new plant in China.  In October 2007we announced an additional $180 million carbon fiber capacity which we nowexpect to be completed by the end of 2010.  Based on expected growthestimates, and in particular our commitment to the Airbus A350XWB, the companyanticipates that it will continue a high level of capital expenditures foradditional capacity for carbon fiber and other products through investingin existing and new facilities. Our capacity expansion plans couldcost more than we anticipated, take longer to complete thanscheduled, or fail to produce the quantity or quality of product tomeet the requirements of customers.  This could result in ournot achieving the growth in business that our capital expenditureplans were designed to deliver, resulting in much higher manufacturing andcapital expenditure costs, pressure on our capital structure and amaterial adverse impact on our financial statements. In addition,these capital expansions are dependent on our ability to generatecash and/or have access to financing on a timely and cost effective basis. A decrease in supply or increase in cost of rawmaterials could result in a material decline in our profitability. Our profitability dependslargely on the price and continuity of supply of raw materials, which aresupplied through a sole source or a limited number of sources.  We purchase large volumes of raw materials,such as epoxy and phenolic resins, aluminum foil, carbon fiber, fiberglass yarnand aramid paper, any restrictions on the supply or the increase in the cost ofour raw materials could significantly reduce our profit margins.  Efforts to mitigate restrictions on thesupply or price increases of these raw materials by long-term purchaseagreements, productivity improvements or by passing cost increases to ourcustomers may not be successful. We have substantial international operations subjectto uncertainties which could affect our operating results. We believe that revenue from sales outside the U.S.will continue to account for a material portion of our total revenue for theforeseeable future.  Additionally, wehave invested significant resources in our international operations and weintend to continue to make such investments in the future. Our internationaloperations are subject to numerous risks, including: ·              thedifficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through some foreignlegal systems; ·              foreigncustomers may have longer payment cycles than customers in the U.S.; ·              cost of compliance with international trade laws of all of the countries inwhich we do business, including export control laws, relating to sales and purchasesof goods and equipment and transfers of technology; ·              taxrates in some foreign countries may exceed those of the U.S. and foreignearnings may be subject to withholding requirements or the imposition oftariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions; 13Tableof Contents ·              generaleconomic and political conditions in the countries where we operatemay have an adverse effect on our operations in those countries or not befavorable to our growth strategy; ·              governmentsmay adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct orindirect adverse impact on our business and market opportunities; and ·              thepotential difficulty in enforcing our intellectual property rights in someforeign countries, and the potential for the intellectual property rights ofothers to affect our ability to sell product in certain markets. Any one of the above could adversely affect ourfinancial condition and results of operations. In addition, fluctuations in currency exchange ratesmay influence the profitability and cash flows of our business.  For example, our European operations sellsome of the products they produce in U.S. dollars, yet the labor, overheadcosts and portions of material costs incurred in the manufacture of thoseproducts is denominated in Euros or British pound sterling. As a result, thelocal currency margins of goods manufactured with costs denominated in local currency,yet sold in U.S. dollars, will vary with fluctuations in currency exchangerates, reducing when the U.S. dollar weakens against the Euro and British poundsterling. In addition, the reported U.S. dollar value of the local currencyfinancial statements of our foreign subsidiaries will vary with fluctuations incurrency exchange rates. While we enter into currency exchange rate hedges fromtime to time to mitigate these types of fluctuations, we cannot remove allfluctuations or hedge all exposures, and our earnings are impacted by changesin currency exchange rates. During the past several years, some countries inwhich we operate or plan to operate have been characterized by varying degreesof inflation and uneven growth rates.
