OSG,OVERSEAS SHIPHOLDING GROUP INC,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/75208/000149315224009567/0001493152-24-009567.txt,2024-03-11T16:05:58-04:00," ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
Our business, including our operating results and financial condition, are subject to a wide variety of risks which could adversely and materially affect our business in many ways. This includes risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained in our filings with the SEC, including our financial statements and related notes. 
Risks Related to Our Company 
Inability to attract or retain qualified mariners may adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business. 
Our vessels must be manned by highly qualified mariners that meet the standards of experience set by our customers. Increasing demand for maritime transportation in all markets has recently spiked, resulting in competition from other shipping sectors which potentially limits the number of mariners available to OSG. During 2023, there were occasions when our vessels sailed short of full crew, requiring permissions and waivers from the US Coast Guard and our customers. Many of the positions filled by our mariners require extensive licensing credentials and experience sailing on the particular type of vessel, as well as time sailing with OSG to be qualified by the US Coast Guard and our customers&#8217; matrix requirements. If we are unable to attract or retain qualified mariners, or if there is an insufficient number of qualified mariners available, we may not be able to provide the services contracted for, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. 
Operating costs and capital expenses will increase as the Company&#8217;s vessels comply with regulatory changes, as the vessels age, or due to unexpected drydocks. 
New or stricter environmental regulations, changes in governmental regulations and compliance with Classification Society standards may require OSG to make investments, capital expenditures, and incur drydock expenses to ensure compliance. Costs necessary for maintaining a vessel in good operating condition increase as the age of the vessel increases. Vessels must be drydocked periodically for inspection and maintenance, and in the event of accidents or other unforeseen damage. These costs are difficult to predict with certainty but can be substantial, and the Company&#8217;s insurance may not cover these costs. In addition, vessels in drydock will generally not generate income. 
As a result of these factors, OSG may incur substantial costs or be required to take its vessels out of service. Market conditions may not justify such expenditures or permit OSG to operate its vessels profitably. These costs, delays, expenses and off-hire time could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Changes in demand in specialized markets in which the Company currently operates or changes in governmental support may lead the Company to redeploy certain vessels to other markets or put its ability to participate in specialized markets at risk. 
The two vessels participating in the TSP derive a substantial percentage of their revenues from transporting cargoes reserved for U.S. Flag vessels under MARAD&#8217;s cargo preference program, which requires shippers to give U.S.-flag vessels a preference to transport any government-impelled ocean-borne cargoes. Among the currently available government&#8211;impelled cargoes is a contract the Company has with the Government of Israel (&#8220;GOI&#8221;) to deliver fuel through December 31, 2024, which the GOI funds with grants from the U.S. government. The Company also seeks other government&#8211;impelled cargoes to supplement the GOI business; however, there is no assurance the Company will be able to secure such cargoes. If OSG is unable to retain the GOI business or is unable to obtain significant other charters for these vessels, the Company may no longer be able to participate in the TSP. 
The Company operates three Jones Act MR Shuttle Tankers, two of which are currently operating as shuttle tankers serving offshore oil installations in the Gulf of Mexico. Modifications made to enable these tankers to perform the specialized service of a shuttle tanker required the Company to incur substantial capital costs, which in turn allow the Company to earn a premium to market rates earned by conventional Jones Act tankers. The customers with wells and fields in the Gulf of Mexico have high cash production costs and, as such, are vulnerable to production cuts or shut down in response to persistently low oil prices. While shuttle tankers can serve as conventional tankers without further modification, a future reduction in the demand for specialized shuttle tanker services could limit the Company&#8217;s ability to earn such premiums. 
The Company conducts lightering operations in the Delaware Bay with one ATB built for these operations. If there is lower demand for this vessel in the Delaware Bay lightering market, the Company might have to redeploy this ATB in other markets in which it may not be able to compete profitably and/or may require substantial modification. 
If OSG is no longer able to participate in any of these niche businesses, the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected. 
The Company&#8217;s significant operating leases may be reduced or replaced on less favorable terms. 
The Company&#8217;s current fleet includes eight vessels that have been chartered-in under operating leases. These leases expire at various points in the future and the Company may not be able to replace these or on as favorable terms. These circumstances could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s future financial position, profitability, and results of operations and cash flow. 
Interruption, failure or breach of OSG&#8217;s information technology and communications systems could impair its ability to operate. 
OSG has both on-shore and ship-board systems that are highly dependent on information technology systems. The Company collects, stores and transmits data using both internal information technology systems and those of third-party vendors. The secure storage, processing, maintenance, and transmission of sensitive data, including our own proprietary business information and that of our customers, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, is critical to the Company&#8217;s operations. 
Information technology and communication systems are subject to reliability issues, integration and compatibility concerns, and security-threatening intrusions. OSG&#8217;s network, or those of our customers or third-party vendors, could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, or targeted attacks intended to steal or destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage. 
The Company may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against these threats or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. Security breaches and viruses could expose the Company to claims, litigation and other possible liabilities and could also cause customers to lose confidence in OSG&#8217;s systems. 
OSG has not experienced any material cyber security violation or occurrence over the last three years, and we invest time, effort and financial resources to proactively secure our systems, networks and communications. However, these actions cannot provide absolute assurance that we will be successful in preventing or responding to all cyber security attacks. Any failure or breach of OSG&#8217;s or third-party systems could result in interruptions in service, reductions in revenue and profits, damage to reputation and brand, or liability for the release of confidential information, all of which may have a material impact on our operations and financial results. 
Delays or disruptions in implementing new technological and management systems could impair the Company&#8217;s ability to operate. 
The Company is currently in the process of transitioning to new software systems for managing ship and financial operations. From time to time the Company implements new systems or upgrades technological resources utilized in running its business. The transition to new technology requires a significant investment in capital and personnel resources and the coordination of numerous software and system providers and internal business teams. The Company may experience difficulties as it manages these changes and transitions to a new system and upgrades its technological resources, including loss or corruption of data, delays, decreases in productivity, and unanticipated expenses. The Company could be adversely affected if the new software systems or other new or upgraded technological resource are defective, not installed properly, fail to perform as marketed or are not properly integrated into existing operations. The implementation of a new system may not result in improvements that outweigh the cost of implementation. System implementation failures or operational failures, including unauthorized access by third parties to our new software system (which could have the effects described in the preceding risk factor) could have adverse effects on the Company&#8217;s business, financial position, and ability to operate in a complex industry. 
Changes in demand have affected Time Charter commitments. OSG may not be able to renew Time Charters when they expire or enter into new Time Charters and vessels may be placed in layup. 
OSG&#8217;s ability to obtain new charters or renew expiring contracts will depend on the prevailing market conditions. Renewals or new contracts may be at less favorable rates or for shorter durations. There may be a gap in employment between charters or the vessel may only be able to be employed on the spot market, both of which would affect utilization rates and result in increased costs to the Company. When there is no demand for a vessel, there is also a risk of the necessity to layup the vessel, as was demonstrated during the course of 2021. These occurrences would adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
The Company has significant indebtedness, may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of its indebtedness, and could breach covenants in its credit facilities and term loans which could affect our ability to finance operations, pursue desirable business opportunities and successfully run the business in the future, all of which could affect OSG&#8217;s ability to fulfill its obligations. 
As of December 31, 2023, OSG had $400.7 million of outstanding indebtedness. This substantial indebtedness and interest expense could have important consequences, including (i) limiting OSG&#8217;s ability to use cash flow from operations in other areas of its business, such as for working capital, because a substantial portion of these funds are dedicated to service its debt; (ii) requiring the Company to seek to incur additional indebtedness in order to make planned capital expenditures and other expenses or investments; (iii) limiting OSG&#8217;s ability to obtain additional financing; (iv) limiting the Company&#8217;s flexibility and ability to capitalize on business opportunities or to react to competitive pressures and adverse changes in government regulation, and OSG&#8217;s business and industry; (v) increasing OSG&#8217;s vulnerability to a downturn and to adverse economic and industry conditions generally; and (vi) limiting the Company&#8217;s ability to enter into hedging transactions by reducing the number of counterparties with whom OSG can enter into such transactions as well as the volume of those transactions. 
The Company&#8217;s earnings, cash flow and the market value of its vessels vary significantly due to general economic, competitive and market conditions affecting the industry, the cyclical nature of the tanker industry, and legislative and regulatory actions &#8211; all factors beyond the control of the Company. The amount of debt that OSG can manage in some periods may not be appropriate for other periods, and OSG&#8217;s ability to meet the financial covenants to which it is subject or may be subject in the future may be at risk. Any insufficiency could negatively impact OSG&#8217;s business. 
Insufficiencies in earnings, cash flow and market value of the vessels could require the Company to make mandatory payments or cause the Company to breach certain covenants. If the Company is unable to remedy the relevant breach or obtain a waiver, the Company&#8217;s lenders could accelerate its debts and foreclose on the Company&#8217;s owned vessels. 
If OSG does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy its debt obligations, it may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as selling tankers or other assets, reducing or delaying investments and capital expenditures, refinancing or restructuring its debt, and/or seeking to raise additional capital. The Company&#8217;s ability to restructure or refinance its debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets, its access to such markets and its financial condition at that time. Any future refinancing of debt could be at higher interest rates and might require the Company to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict OSG&#8217;s business operations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict OSG from adopting certain alternatives. These potential undertakings and alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit OSG to meet its scheduled debt service obligations. 
The Company&#8217;s inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its debt obligations, to meet its financial covenants, to reduce debt, and/or to obtain alternative financing, could materially and adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
The Company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from a limited number of customers and is subject to credit risks, and the loss of, or reduction in business by, any of these customers could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. 
The Company&#8217;s largest customers account for a significant portion of its revenues. The Company&#8217;s top customer comprised approximately 14.3% of the Company&#8217;s revenues during 2023. Changes in the broader market, such as closures of U.S. refining facilities, have reduced the locations to and from which oil is delivered or refined oil is sourced. 
The Company has entered into, and in the future will enter into, various contracts associated with the operation of its vessels. The ability of each of the Company&#8217;s customers, lenders, suppliers, and other counterparties to perform their obligations will depend on a number of factors that are beyond the Company&#8217;s control and may include general economic conditions; availability of debt or equity financing; the condition of the maritime and offshore industries; the financial condition of the counterparty; charter rates received for specific types of vessels; and volatile expenses in obtaining supplies. Charterers are sensitive to the commodity markets and may be impacted by market forces affecting commodities such as oil. In addition, in depressed market conditions, the Company&#8217;s charterers and customers may no longer need a vessel that had been under charter or contract or may be able to obtain a comparable vessel at lower rates, or adverse financial conditions may inhibit these entities from entering into new commitments with OSG. As a result, the Company&#8217;s customers may fail to pay charter hire or attempt to renegotiate charter rates. If the counterparties fail to meet their obligations, the Company could suffer losses on such contracts which would decrease revenues, cash flows and earnings. 
These factors could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s revenues, profitability and cash flows, as well as its borrowing ability and financial condition. The loss of, or reduction in business by, any of these customers and refinery locations could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition and results of operations. 
The Company could face significant liability if one or more multiemployer plans in which it participates is reported to have underfunded liabilities or if the Company withdraws from participation in one or more multiemployer pension plans in which it participates. 
The Company is a party to collective-bargaining agreements that require contributions to three jointly managed multiemployer pension plans covering seagoing personnel of U.S. Flag vessels. Our required contributions to these plans could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these plans, the inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability, low interest rates, lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. Certain of these multiemployer plans are currently underfunded. Significantly underfunded pension plans are required to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their under-funding. As a result, OSG&#8217;s required contributions to these plans may increase in the future. In addition, a termination of or voluntary withdrawal from or a mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from an underfunded multiemployer pension plan would require OSG to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of such multiemployer pension plan&#8217;s unfunded vested liabilities. See Note 15, &#8220;Pension, Other Post Retirement Benefit Plans and Benefit Liabilities,&#8221; to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 for additional information. Requirements to pay increased contributions or withdrawal liabilities could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and results of operations. 
Risks Related to Our Industry 
Volatile changes in supply and demand for oil and refined products, charter rates and vessel values, and the factors that influence such changes may adversely affect our business. 
The marine transportation industry is both cyclical and volatile in terms of demand, charter rates and profitability. Fluctuations in charter rates and vessel values result from changes in supply and demand both for tanker capacity and for oil and oil products. Factors affecting these changes in supply and demand are generally outside of the Company&#8217;s control and include: (i) supply and demand for, and availability of energy resources such as oil, oil products and natural gas, which affect customers&#8217; need for vessel capacity; (ii) availability of refining capacity and inventories; (iii) changes in the production levels of crude oil; (iv) increases in the supply of Jones Act vessels without a commensurate increase in demand; (v) global and regional economic and political conditions, including armed conflicts, terrorist activities and strikes, and international sanctions, embargoes, import and export restrictions or nationalizations and wars, such as the conditions in the Middle East and the Russian war in Ukraine, that create uncertainties in the supply of and demand for oil; (vi) changes in seaborne and other transportation patterns, including rerouting of voyages to avoid areas of conflict, such as that currently occurring in the Red Sea, changes in the distances that cargoes are transported, changes in the price of crude oil and changes to the West Texas Intermediate and Brent Crude Oil pricing benchmarks; and (vii) increasing interest globally, from a regulatory and demand viewpoint, in transitioning to carbon neutral energy sources and the development and use of alternative fuels in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that impact the fuel we transport as cargo and use in fueling our own vessels.
Many of the factors that influence the demand for tanker capacity will also, in the longer term, effectively influence the supply of tanker capacity, since decisions to build new capacity, invest in capital repairs, invest in new technologies or equipment, or to retain in service older capacity are influenced by the general state of the marine transportation industry. Factors influencing the supply of vessel capacity include (i) the number of newbuild deliveries or the conversion of vessels into or out of transporting oil; (ii) the number of vessels removed from service, such as via recycling, scrapping or conversion to storage; and (iii) the availability and pricing of other energy sources such as natural gas for which tankers can be used or to which construction capacity may be dedicated. 
The nature, timing and degree of changes in industry conditions are unpredictable and could adversely affect the values of the Company&#8217;s vessels or result in significant fluctuations in the amount of charter revenues the Company earns, which could result in significant volatility in OSG&#8217;s operations, financial results and cash flows. 
OSG conducts certain of its operations internationally, subjecting the Company to changing economic, political and governmental conditions abroad, as well as terrorism, piracy and hostilities. 
The Company conducts certain of its operations internationally, and its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected by changing economic, political and government conditions in the countries and regions where its vessels are employed. OSG must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as environmental regulations, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, anti-money laundering laws; and anti-competition regulations. OSG&#8217;s operations may also subject its employees and agents to extortion attempts. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on the Company&#8217;s business operations and on the Company&#8217;s ability to transport cargo to one or more countries, and could also materially affect the Company&#8217;s brand, ability to attract and retain employees, international operations, business and operating results. Although OSG has policies and procedures designed to achieve compliance with these laws and regulations, OSG cannot be certain that its employees, contractors, joint venture partners or agents will not violate these policies and procedures. 
There are occasions when a vessel is operating in an area where terrorist or pirate attacks, or hijackings are a concern. If this occurs in regions in which are characterized by insurers as &#8220;war risk&#8221; zones or Joint War Committee &#8220;war and strikes&#8221; listed areas, premiums payable for insurance coverage could increase significantly, and such insurance coverage may become difficult to obtain. Crew costs could also increase in such circumstances. While OSG believes the charterer remains liable for charter payments when a vessel is seized by pirates, disputes with the charterer may result in the delay or non-payment of charter hire, or cancellation of the charter party. The Company may not be adequately insured to cover losses from these incidents, or an increase in the cost (or unavailability) of insurance for those vessels could have a material adverse impact on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Such attacks may also impact the Company&#8217;s customers, which could impair their ability to make payments to the Company under its charters. 
Terrorism or international hostilities could cause political instability, damage the world economy, adversely affect the availability of and demand for crude oil and petroleum products and adversely affect both the Company&#8217;s ability to charter its vessels and the charter rates payable under any such charters. Such circumstances are present currently as a result of the conditions in the Middle East and the Russian war on Ukraine. 
These factors could also increase the costs to the Company of conducting its business, particularly crew, insurance and security costs, and prevent or restrict the Company from obtaining insurance coverage, all of which could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Changes in fuel prices may adversely a ffect our earnings. 
Fuel is a significant expense in the Company&#8217;s shipping operations when vessels are under voyage charter. Accordingly, an increase in the price of fuel may adversely affect the Company&#8217;s profitability if these increases cannot be passed onto customers. Moreover, higher fuel prices could reduce the profitability and competitiveness of the Company&#8217;s business compared to other forms of transportation. The price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside the Company&#8217;s control. 
The impact from public health threats may adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations, and financial condition . 
COVID-19 revealed the significant impacts throughout the world of a threat to public health. Such threats prompt governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response, including restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. Global pandemics can, and have, significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets, which could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. The extent to which global or regional health threats impact the Company&#8217;s operational and financial performance depends on many factors outside the Company&#8217;s control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the threat; the emergence of new variants; availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments; the imposition or relaxation of protective public safety measures; and the impact on the economy and demand for petroleum products and the Company&#8217;s vessels. 
The market value of vessels fluctuates significantly, which could adversely affect OSG&#8217;s liquidity or otherwise adversely affect its financial condition. 
The market value of Jones Act and U.S. Flag vessels has fluctuated over time. The fluctuating market values of the vessels can impact the Company&#8217;s liquidity regardless of whether the Company sells or continues to hold the vessels. For example, selling a vessel at a sale price that is less than the vessel&#8217;s carrying amount on the Company&#8217;s financial statements will result in a loss on the sale and a reduction in earnings and surplus. Declining values of the Company&#8217;s vessels could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s liquidity by limiting its ability to raise cash by refinancing vessels. The Company may also experience significant impairment charges upon a decline in vessel value. Any charges relating to such impairments could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. 
Shipping is a business with inherent risks, and OSG&#8217;s insurance may not be adequate to cover its losses. 
OSG&#8217;s vessels and cargoes are at risk of being damaged or lost due to accidents, bad weather, mechanical failure, human error, and other factors. These hazards may result in death or injury; loss of revenues or property; environmental damage; higher insurance rates; damage to customer relationships and industry reputation; and market disruptions, and delay or rerouting, all of which may also subject OSG to litigation. The operation of tankers has unique operational risks associated with the transportation of oil. An oil spill may cause significant environmental damage and the associated costs could exceed the insurance coverage available to the Company. While the Company carries insurance to protect against certain of these risks, risks may arise against which the Company is not adequately insured. In the past, new and stricter environmental regulations have led to higher costs for insurance covering environmental damage or pollution, and new regulations could lead to similar increases or even make this type of insurance unavailable. The occurrence of the events described above, and the increases in the costs (or unavailability) of insurance covering such events could adversely affect the OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. 
Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters 
Compliance with complex laws and regulations and environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the emission of greenhouse gas gases, may adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business. 
The Company&#8217;s operations are affected by extensive, complex, and changing international, national, and local environmental protection laws, regulations, treaties, conventions and standards designed to reduce the risk of oil spills and water pollution and to regulate and reduce air emissions, including emission of greenhouse gases. These regulations are summarized in detail in Item 1, &#8220;Business - Environmental, Safety and Security Matters&#8221;. These requirements impose significant capital and operating costs on OSG as well as the potential for unlimited liability in certain circumstances. 
Due to concern over the risks of climate change, a number of countries, including the United States, and international organizations, including the IMO and the EU, have adopted, or are considering the adoption or modification of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Regulations and the reporting mechanisms to measure emissions are evolving, as multiple concerned constituents attempt to standardize the measurement and reporting of varying operational factors for many types of vessels and conditions, including such measures as the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (&#8220;EEXI&#8221;) and the Carbon Intensity Indicator (&#8220;CII&#8221;). The CII&#8217;s letter grading system for a ship&#8217;s CO 2 emissions performance is based upon calculation methodologies that are presently being debated, correction factors that are open to further modification, and a review process that will remain open until 2026, leading to considerable uncertainties in interpretation and enforcement. Absent a change in the CII rules as currently stated, ships with low grades may face the potential threat of enforcement and retirement if the ratings do not improve during the stipulated remediation period. The mechanisms to achieve a &#8220;passing&#8221; grade may require changes in the responsibilities among the supply chain participants, changes to the operating patterns of vessels or the speeds at which they may sail, or the types of fuel to be consumed, as well as capital investments in equipment and technology many of which are not yet established as viable. 
These regulations could result in significant financial and operational impacts on the Company&#8217;s business and on the global industry, including requiring OSG to install new emission controls, to invest in technologies or equipment, to retrofit vessels, to acquire allowances, or to pay taxes related to its greenhouse gas emissions. Further, in cases where the Company invests in new technologies or equipment, there is no assurance that such technologies or equipment will perform as expected, notwithstanding that the Company will have performed due diligence in selecting the particular technology or equipment. 
Environmental laws and regulations can affect the resale value or significantly reduce the useful lives of the Company&#8217;s vessels, require a reduction in carrying capacity, ship modifications, or operational changes or restrictions (and related increased operating costs) or retirement of service, lead to decreased availability or higher cost of insurance coverage for environmental matters, or result in the denial of access to, or detention in, certain jurisdictional waters or ports. Under local, national and foreign laws, as well as international treaties and conventions, OSG could incur material liabilities, including cleanup obligations, natural resource damages, fines and penalties in the event that there is a release of oil, petroleum or other hazardous substances from its vessels or otherwise in connection with its operations. OSG could be subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to the release of or exposure to hazardous materials associated with its current or historic operations. Violations of or liabilities under environmental requirements also can result in substantial penalties, fines and other sanctions, including in certain instances, seizure or detention of the Company&#8217;s vessels. 
It can be expected that these regulations will continue to become stricter in the future and will require the Company to incur significant capital expenditures to keep its vessels in compliance, or even to scrap or sell certain vessels altogether. Such expenditures could result in financial and operational impacts that may be material to OSG&#8217;s financial condition. The failure to comply with local, domestic and foreign regulations may subject the Company to increased liability, may invalidate existing insurance or decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports. 
Failure to comply with the Jones Act&#8217;s limitations on U.S. coastwise trade, or waiver, modification or repeal of the Jones Act, or changes in international trade agreements may impact the Company&#8217;s ability to compete. 
The Company is responsible for monitoring the foreign ownership of its common stock and other interests to ensure compliance with the Jones Act. The Company could lose the privilege of owning and operating vessels in the Jones Act trade if non-U.S. Citizens were to own or control, in the aggregate, more than 25% of the equity interests in the Company. Such loss would have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business and results of operations. In addition, failure to comply with the Jones Act could result in the Company being deemed to have violated other U.S. federal laws that prohibit a foreign transfer of U.S. documented vessels without government approval, resulting in severe penalties, including permanent loss of U.S. coastwise trading privileges or forfeiture of the vessels deemed transferred, and fines. 
Maritime transportation services are currently excluded from the General Agreement on Trade in Services (&#8220;GATS&#8221;) and are the subject of reservations by the United States in the North American Free Trade Agreement (&#8220;NAFTA&#8221;) and other international free trade agreements. If maritime transportation services were included in GATS, NAFTA or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise repealed or altered, the transportation of maritime cargo between U.S. ports could be opened to international flag or foreign built vessels. 
Interest groups regularly lobby Congress, and legislation has been introduced, to repeal certain provisions of the Jones Act or to grant extensive waivers so as to facilitate international flag competition for trades and cargoes currently reserved for U.S. Flag vessels under the Jones Act. The Jones Act requires vessels to be U.S.-owned, U.S.-crewed, and U.S.-built, and in the event that any one of these requirements is not met resulting in the unavailability of a Jones Act qualified vessel, a waiver could be issued. A waiver, modification or repeal of the Jones Act could significantly increase competition in the coastwise trade and could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
The inability to clear the oil majors&#8217; risk assessment processes may adversely impact the Company&#8217;s ability to perform its services. 
The major oil companies have developed strict due diligence processes for selecting their shipping partners out of concerns for the environmental impact of spills. This vetting process has evolved into a sophisticated and comprehensive risk assessment of both the vessel manager and the vessel. The Company&#8217;s charterers require that the Company&#8217;s vessels and the technical managers pass vetting inspections and management audits. The failure of the Company&#8217;s vessels or managers to maintain these standards could put the Company in breach of the applicable charter agreement and lead to termination of such agreement, thereby adversely affecting revenues. 
The U.S. government could requisition the Company&#8217;s vessels during a period of war or emergency. 
The U.S. government could requisition one or more of the Company&#8217;s vessels for title or hire, typically occurring during a period of war or emergency. OSG participates in the Tanker Security Program for such purposes. The U.S. government requisition of one or more of the Company&#8217;s vessels could impact the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and available cash if the charter rates we receive from the government while on requisition are less than the charter rates that are being replaced, or if the government refuses to pay the requisition charter rate.
Transfers or issuances of the Company&#8217;s equity may impair or reduce the Company&#8217;s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes in the future. 
Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an &#8220;ownership change&#8221; to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change. An &#8220;ownership change&#8221; is generally defined as any change in ownership of more than 50% of a corporation&#8217;s stock over a rolling three-year period by stockholders that own (directly or indirectly) 5% or more of the stock of a corporation or arising from a new issuance of stock by a corporation. If an ownership change occurs, Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the use of pre-ownership change net operating losses, credits and certain other tax attributes to offset taxable income earned after the ownership change. The annual limitation is equal to the product of the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate and the value of the company&#8217;s stock immediately before the ownership change. This annual limitation may be adjusted to reflect any unused annual limitation for prior years and certain recognized built-in gains and losses for the year. In addition, Section 383 generally limits the amount of tax liability in any post-ownership change year that can be reduced by pre-ownership change tax credit carryforwards. If the Company were to undergo an &#8220;ownership change,&#8221; and therefore become subject to limitations described above, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

OSG,OVERSEAS SHIPHOLDING GROUP INC,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/75208/000149315223007123/0001493152-23-007123.txt,2023-03-09T16:06:33-05:00," ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
Our business, including our operating results and financial condition, are subject to a wide variety of risks, including risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial but that could materially and adversely affect our business. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained in our filings with the SEC, including our financial statements and related notes. 
Risks Related to Our Company 
Inability to attract or retain qualified mariners may adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business. 
Our vessels must be manned by highly qualified mariners that meet the standards of experience set by our customers. Volatility in demand has an effect on the availability of qualified mariners. Increasing demand for maritime transportation in all markets has recently spiked, resulting in competition from other shipping sectors, such as container shipping, which potentially limits the number of mariners available to OSG. If we are unable to attract or retain qualified mariners, we may not be able to provide the services contracted for, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. 
The Company&#8217;s significant operating leases were reduced and the remaining operating leases could be replaced on less favorable terms. 
The Company&#8217;s current fleet includes seven vessels that have been chartered-in under operating leases. T hese leases expire at various points in the future, and the Company may not be able to replace these at all or on as favorable terms. These circumstances could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s future financial position, profitability, and results of operations and cash flow.
Operating costs and capital expenses will increase as the Company&#8217;s vessels comply with regulatory changes, or as the vessels age, or due to unexpected drydocks. 
Changes in governmental regulations and compliance with Classification Society standards may restrict the type of activities in which the vessels may engage and/or may require OSG to make additional expenditures for new equipment. In general, capital expenditures, cargo insurance rates and other costs necessary for maintaining a vessel in good operating condition increase as the age of the vessel increases. Vessels must be drydocked periodically for inspection and maintenance, and in the event of accidents or other unforeseen damage. The cost of repairs and renewals required at each drydock are difficult to predict with certainty but can be substantial, and the Company&#8217;s insurance may not cover these costs. Vessels in drydock will generally not generate any income. In addition, the time when a vessel is out of service for maintenance is determined by a number of factors including regulatory deadlines, market conditions, shipyard availability and customer requirements. 
As a result of these factors, OSG may be required to incur substantial costs or take its vessels out of service. Market conditions may not justify such expenditures or permit OSG to operate its vessels profitably even if those vessels remain operational. These cost increases, delays, expenses and off-hire time could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Changes in demand in specialized markets in which the Company currently operates or changes in governmental support may lead the Company to redeploy certain vessels to other markets or put its ability to participate in specialized markets at risk. 
The Company has two vessels participating in the MSP that derive a substantial percentage of their revenues from transporting cargoes reserved for U.S. Flag vessels under MARAD&#8217;s cargo preference program, which requires shippers to give U.S.-flag vessels a preference to transport any government-impelled ocean-borne cargoes. Among the currently available government&#8211;impelled cargoes is a contract the Company has with the Government of Israel (&#8220;GOI&#8221;) to deliver fuel through December 31, 2023, which the GOI funds with grants from the U.S. government. The Company also seeks other government&#8211;impelled cargoes to supplement the GOI business; however, there is no assurance the Company will be able to secure such cargoes. If OSG is unable to retain the GOI business or is unable to obtain significant other charters for these vessels, the Company may no longer be able to participate in the MSP. 
The Company operates three Jones Act MR Shuttle Tankers, two of which are currently operating as shuttle tankers serving offshore oil installations in the Gulf of Mexico. Modifications made to enable these tankers to perform the specialized service of a shuttle tanker required the Company to incur substantial capital costs, which in turn allow the Company to earn a premium to market rates earned by conventional Jones Act tankers. The customers with wells and fields in the Gulf of Mexico have high cash production costs and, as such, are vulnerable to production cuts or shut down in response to persistently low oil prices. While shuttle tankers can serve as conventional tankers without further modification, future reduction in the demand for specialized shuttle tanker services could limit the Company&#8217;s ability to earn such premiums. 
The Company conducts lightering operations in the Delaware Bay with one ATB built for these operations. If there is lower demand for this vessel in the Delaware Bay lightering market, the Company might have to redeploy this ATB in other markets in which it may not be able to compete profitably and/or may require substantial modification. 
If OSG is no longer able to participate in any of these niche businesses, the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected. 
Changes in demand have affected Time Charter commitments. OSG may not be able to renew Time Charters when they expire or enter into new Time Charters and vessels may be placed in layup. 
OSG&#8217;s ability to obtain new charters or renew expiring contracts will depend on the prevailing market conditions. Renewals or new contracts may be at less favorable rates or for shorter durations. There may be a gap in employment between charters or the vessel may only be able to be employed on the spot market, both of which would affect utilization rates and result in increased costs to the Company. When there is no demand for a vessel, there is also a risk of the necessity to layup the vessel, as was demonstrated during the course of 2021. These occurrences would adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
The Company has significant indebtedness, may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of its indebtedness, and could breach covenants in its credit facilities and term loans which could affect our ability to finance operations, pursue desirable business opportunities and successfully run the business in the future, all of which could affect OSG&#8217;s ability to fulfill its obligations. 
As of December 31, 2022, OSG had $423.4 million of outstanding indebtedness. This substantial indebtedness and interest expense could have important consequences, including (i) limiting OSG&#8217;s ability to use cash flow from operations in other areas of its business, such as for working capital, because a substantial portion of these funds are dedicated to service its debt; (ii) requiring the Company to seek to incur additional indebtedness in order to make planned capital expenditures and other expenses or investments; (iii) limiting OSG&#8217;s ability to obtain additional financing; (iv) limiting the Company&#8217;s flexibility and ability to capitalize on business opportunities or to react to competitive pressures and adverse changes in government regulation, and OSG&#8217;s business and industry; (v) increasing OSG&#8217;s vulnerability to a downturn and to adverse economic and industry conditions generally; and (vi) limiting the Company&#8217;s ability to enter into hedging transactions by reducing the number of counterparties with whom OSG can enter into such transactions as well as the volume of those transactions. 
The Company&#8217;s earnings, cash flow and the market value of its vessels vary significantly due to direct impacts of health threats such as the COVID-19 pandemic, general economic, competitive and market conditions affecting the industry, the cyclical nature of the tanker industry, and legislative and regulatory actions &#8211; all factors beyond the control of the Company. The amount of debt that OSG can manage in some periods may not be appropriate for other periods, and OSG&#8217;s ability to meet the financial covenants to which it is subject or may be subject in the future may be at risk. Any insufficiency could negatively impact OSG&#8217;s business. 
Insufficiencies in earnings, cash flow and market value of the vessels could require the Company to make mandatory payments or cause the Company to breach certain covenants. If the Company is unable to remedy the relevant breach or obtain a waiver, the Company&#8217;s lenders could accelerate its debts and foreclose on the Company&#8217;s owned vessels. 
If OSG does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy its debt obligations, it may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as selling tankers or other assets, reducing or delaying investments and capital expenditures, refinancing or restructuring its debt, and/or seeking to raise additional capital. The Company&#8217;s ability to restructure or refinance its debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets, its access to such markets and its financial condition at that time. Any future refinancing of debt could be at higher interest rates and might require the Company to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict OSG&#8217;s business operations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict OSG from adopting certain alternatives. These potential undertakings and alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit OSG to meet its scheduled debt service obligations. 
The Company&#8217;s inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its debt obligations, to meet its financial covenants, to reduce debt, and/or to obtain alternative financing, could materially and adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
The Company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from a limited number of customers and is subject to credit risks, and the loss of, or reduction in business by, any of these customers could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. 
The Company&#8217;s largest customers account for a significant portion of its revenues. The Company&#8217;s top two customers comprised approximately 24.4% of the Company&#8217;s revenues during 2022. Changes in the broader market, such as closures of U.S. refining facilities, have reduced the locations to and from which oil is delivered or refined oil is sourced. 
The Company has entered into, and in the future will enter into, various contracts associated with the operation of its vessels. The ability of each of the Company&#8217;s customers, lenders, suppliers, and other counterparties to perform their obligations will depend on a number of factors that are beyond the Company&#8217;s control and may include general economic conditions; availability of debt or equity financing; the condition of the maritime and offshore industries; the financial condition of the counterparty; charter rates received for specific types of vessels; and volatile expenses in obtaining supplies. Charterers are sensitive to the commodity markets and may be impacted by market forces affecting commodities such as oil. In addition, in depressed market conditions, the Company&#8217;s charterers and customers may no longer need a vessel that had been under charter or contract or may be able to obtain a comparable vessel at lower rates, or adverse financial conditions may inhibit these entities from entering into new commitments with OSG. As a result, the Company&#8217;s customers may fail to pay charter hire or attempt to renegotiate charter rates. If the counterparties fail to meet their obligations, the Company could suffer losses on such contracts which would decrease revenues, cash flows and earnings. 
These factors could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s revenues, profitability and cash flows, as well as its borrowing ability and financial condition. The loss of, or reduction in business by, any of these customers and refinery locations could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition and results of operations. 
Interruption, failure or breach of OSG&#8217;s information technology and communications systems could impair its ability to operate and adversely affect its business. 
OSG has both on-shore and ship-board systems that are highly dependent on information technology systems. The Company collects, stores and transmits data using both internal information technology systems and those of third-party vendors. The secure storage, processing, maintenance, and transmission of sensitive data, including our own proprietary business information and that of our customers, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, is critical to the Company&#8217;s operations. 
Information technology and communication systems are subject to reliability issues, integration and compatibility concerns, and security-threatening intrusions. OSG may experience failures caused by the occurrence of natural disasters, computer hacking or viruses or other unanticipated problems at OSG&#8217;s facilities, aboard its vessels or at third-party locations. OSG&#8217;s network, or those of our clients or third-party vendors, could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, or targeted attacks intended to steal or destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage. 
The Company may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against these threats or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. Security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, litigation and other possible liabilities and could also cause customers to lose confidence in our systems. 
OSG has not experienced any material cyber security violation or occurrence over the last three years, and we invest time, effort and financial resources to proactively secure our systems, networks and communications. However, these investments cannot provide absolute assurance that we will be successful in preventing or responding to all cyber security attacks. Any failure of OSG&#8217;s or third-party systems could result in interruptions in service, reductions in revenue and profits, damage to reputation and brand, or liability for the release of confidential information, and any breach or incident may have a material impact on our operations and financial results. 
Delays or disruptions in implementing new technological and management systems could impair the Company&#8217;s ability to operate and adversely affect its business. 
The Company is currently in the process of transitioning to a new software system for managing ship operations. From time to time the Company implements new systems or upgrades technological resources utilized in running its business. The transition to new technology requires a significant investment in capital and personnel resources and the coordination of numerous software and system providers and internal business teams. The Company may experience difficulties as it manages these changes and transitions to a new system and upgrades its technological resources, including loss or corruption of data, delays, decreases in productivity as personnel implement and become familiar with new systems and processes, and unanticipated expenses. Additionally, the Company could be adversely affected if the new software system it is implementing for managing ship operations or other new or upgraded technological resource are defective, not installed properly, fail to perform as marketed or are not properly integrated into existing operations. In addition, the implementation of a new system may not result in improvements that outweigh the cost of implementation. System implementation failures or operational failures, including unauthorized access by third parties to our new software system (which could have the effects described in the preceding risk factor) could have adverse effects on the Company&#8217;s business, financial position, and ability to operate in a complex industry. 
The Company could face significant liability if one or more multiemployer plans in which it participates is reported to have underfunded liabilities or if the Company withdraws from participation in one or more multiemployer pension plans in which it participates. 
The Company is a party to collective-bargaining agreements that require contributions to three jointly managed multiemployer pension plans covering seagoing personnel of U.S. Flag vessels. Our required contributions to these plans could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these plans, the inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability, low interest rates, lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. Certain of these multiemployer plans are currently underfunded. Significantly underfunded pension plans are required to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their under-funding. As a result, OSG&#8217;s required contributions to these plans may increase in the future. In addition, a termination of or voluntary withdrawal from or a mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from an underfunded multiemployer pension plan would require OSG to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of such multiemployer pension plan&#8217;s unfunded vested liabilities. See Note 15, &#8220;Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefit Plans,&#8221; to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 for additional information. Requirements to pay increased contributions or withdrawal liabilities could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and results of operations. 
Risks Related to Our Industry 
The Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by public health threats. 
COVID-19 revealed the significant impacts throughout the world of a threat to public health. Such threats prompt governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response, including restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. Global pandemics can, and have, significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets, which could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. The extent to which global or regional health threats impact the Company&#8217;s operational and financial performance depends on many factors outside the Company&#8217;s control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the threat; the emergence of new variants; availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments; the imposition or relaxation of protective public safety measures; and the impact on the economy and demand for petroleum products and the Company&#8217;s vessels. 
Volatile changes in supply and demand for oil and refined products, charter rates and vessel values, and the factors that influence such changes, could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s earnings, liquidity and available cash. 
The marine transportation industry is both cyclical and volatile in terms of demand, charter rates and profitability. Fluctuations in charter rates and vessel values result from changes in supply and demand both for tanker capacity and for oil and oil products. Factors affecting these changes in supply and demand are generally outside of the Company&#8217;s control. Factors influencing the demand for tanker capacity, and impacting our costs and profitability, include: (i) supply and demand for, and availability of energy resources such as oil, oil products and natural gas, which affect customers&#8217; need for vessel capacity; (ii) availability of refining capacity and inventories; (iii) changes in the production levels of crude oil; (iv) increases in the supply of Jones Act vessels without a commensurate increase in demand; (v) global and regional economic and political conditions, including armed conflicts, terrorist activities and strikes, and international sanctions, embargoes, import and export restrictions or nationalizations and wars, such as the Russian war in Ukraine, that create uncertainties in the supply of and demand for oil; (vi) changes in seaborne and other transportation patterns, including changes in the distances that cargoes are transported, changes in the price of crude oil and changes to the West Texas Intermediate and Brent Crude Oil pricing benchmarks; and (vii) increasing interest globally, from a regulatory and demand viewpoint, in transitioning to carbon neutral energy sources and the development and use of alternative fuels in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that impact the fuel we transport as cargo and use in fueling our own vessels. 
Many of the factors that influence the demand for tanker capacity will also, in the longer term, effectively influence the supply of tanker capacity, since decisions to build new capacity, invest in capital repairs, invest in new technologies or equipment, or to retain in service older capacity are influenced by the general state of the marine transportation industry from time to time. Factors influencing the supply of vessel capacity include (i) the number of newbuild deliveries or the conversion of vessels into or out of transporting oil; (ii) the number of vessels removed from service, such as via recycling, scrapping or conversion to storage; and (iii) the availability and pricing of other energy sources such as natural gas for which tankers can be used or to which construction capacity may be dedicated. 
The nature, timing and degree of changes in industry conditions are unpredictable and could adversely affect the values of the Company&#8217;s vessels or result in significant fluctuations in the amount of charter revenues the Company earns, which could result in significant volatility in OSG&#8217;s operations, financial results and cash flows. 
Changes in fuel prices may adversely a ffect our earnings. 
Fuel is a significant expense in the Company&#8217;s shipping operations when vessels are under voyage charter. Accordingly, an increase in the price of fuel may adversely affect the Company&#8217;s profitability if these increases cannot be passed onto customers. Moreover, higher fuel prices could reduce the profitability and competitiveness of the Company&#8217;s business compared to other forms of transportation. The price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside the Company&#8217;s control. 
The market value of vessels fluctuates significantly, which could adversely affect OSG&#8217;s liquidity or otherwise adversely affect its financial condition. 
The market value of Jones Act and U.S. Flag vessels has fluctuated over time. The fluctuating market values of the vessels can impact the Company&#8217;s liquidity regardless of whether the Company sells or continues to hold the vessels. For example, selling a vessel at a sale price that is less than the vessel&#8217;s carrying amount on the Company&#8217;s financial statements will result in a loss on the sale and a reduction in earnings and surplus. Declining values of the Company&#8217;s vessels could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s liquidity by limiting its ability to raise cash by refinancing vessels. The Company may also experience significant impairment charges upon a decline in vessel value. Any charges relating to such impairments could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. 
OSG conducts certain of its operations internationally, which subjects the Company to changing economic, political and governmental conditions abroad that may adversely affect its business. 
The Company conducts certain of its operations internationally, and its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected by changing economic, political and government conditions in the countries and regions where its vessels are employed. OSG must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as environmental regulations requiring investments and upgrades, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, anti-money laundering laws; and anti-competition regulations. OSG&#8217;s operations may also subject its employees and agents to extortion attempts. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on the Company&#8217;s business operations and on the Company&#8217;s ability to transport cargo to one or more countries, and could also materially affect the Company&#8217;s brand, ability to attract and retain employees, international operations, business and operating results. Although OSG has policies and procedures designed to achieve compliance with these laws and regulations, OSG cannot be certain that its employees, contractors, joint venture partners or agents will not violate these policies and procedures. 
Shipping is a business with inherent risks, and OSG&#8217;s insurance may not be adequate to cover its losses. 
OSG&#8217;s vessels and their cargoes are at risk of being damaged or lost due to accidents, bad weather, mechanical failure, human error, and other factors. These hazards may result in death or injury; loss of revenues or property; environmental damage; higher insurance rates; damage to customer relationships and industry reputation; and market disruptions, and delay or rerouting, all of which may also subject OSG to litigation. The operation of tankers has unique operational risks associated with the transportation of oil. An oil spill may cause significant environmental damage and the associated costs could exceed the insurance coverage available to the Company. While the Company carries insurance to protect against certain of these risks, risks may arise against which the Company is not adequately insured. In the past, new and stricter environmental regulations have led to higher costs for insurance covering environmental damage or pollution, and new regulations could lead to similar increases or even make this type of insurance unavailable. The occurrence of the events described above, and the increases in the costs (or unavailability) of insurance covering such events could adversely affect the OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. 
Terrorism, piracy, or hostilities could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business. 
Although the Company&#8217;s fleet operates mainly in U.S. waters, there are occasions when a vessel may be in an area where terrorist or pirate attacks, or hijackings are a concern. If attacks result in regions in which the Company&#8217;s vessels are deployed being characterized by insurers as &#8220;war risk&#8221; zones or Joint War Committee &#8220;war and strikes&#8221; listed areas, premiums payable for insurance coverage could increase significantly, and such insurance coverage may become difficult to obtain. Crew costs could also increase in such circumstances due to risks of piracy attacks. While OSG believes the charterer remains liable for charter payments when a vessel is seized by pirates, disputes with the charterer may result in the delay or non-payment of charter hire, or cancellation of the charter party. The Company may not be adequately insured to cover losses from these incidents, or an increase in the cost (or unavailability) of insurance for those vessels could have a material adverse impact on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Such attacks may also impact the Company&#8217;s customers, which could impair their ability to make payments to the Company under its charters. 
Terrorism or international hostilities could cause political instability, damage the world economy, adversely affect the availability of and demand for crude oil and petroleum products and adversely affect both the Company&#8217;s ability to charter its vessels and the charter rates payable under any such charters. These factors could also increase the costs to the Company of conducting its business, particularly crew, insurance and security costs, and prevent or restrict the Company from obtaining insurance coverage, all of which could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters 
Compliance with complex laws and regulations and environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the emission of greenhouse gas gases, may adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business. 
The Company&#8217;s operations are affected by extensive, complex, and changing international, national, and local environmental protection laws, regulations, treaties, conventions and standards designed to reduce the risk of oil spills and water pollution and to regulate and reduce air emissions, including emission of greenhouse gases. These regulations are summarized in detail in Item 1, &#8220;Business - Environmental, Safety and Security Matters&#8221;. These requirements impose significant capital and operating costs on OSG as well as the potential for unlimited liability in certain circumstances. 
Due to concern over the risks of climate change, a number of countries, including the United States, and international organizations, including the IMO and the EU, have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Regulations and the reporting mechanisms to measure emissions are evolving, as multiple concerned constituents attempt to standardize the measurement and reporting of varying operational factors for many types of vessels and conditions, including such measures as the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (&#8220;EEXI&#8221;) and the Carbon Intensity Indicator (&#8220;CII&#8221;). The CII&#8217;s letter grading system for a ship&#8217;s CO2 emissions performance is based upon calculation methodologies that are presently being debated, correction factors that are open to further modification, and a review process that will remain open until 2026, leading to considerable uncertainties in interpretation and enforcement. Absent a change in the CII rules as currently stated, ships with low grades may face the potential threat of enforcement and retirement if the ratings do not improve during the stipulated remediation period. The mechanisms to achieve a &#8220;passing&#8221; grade may require changes in the responsibilities among the supply chain participants, changes to the operating patterns of vessels or the speeds at which they may sail, or the types of fuel to be consumed, as well as capital investments in equipment and technology many of which are not yet established as viable. 
These regulations could result in significant financial and operational impacts on the Company&#8217;s business and on the global industry, including requiring OSG to install new emission controls, to invest in technologies or equipment, to retrofit vessels, to acquire allowances, or to pay taxes related to its greenhouse gas emissions. Further, in cases where the Company invests in new technologies or equipment, there is no assurance that such technologies or equipment will perform as expected, notwithstanding that the Company will have performed due diligence in selecting the particular technology or equipment. 
Environmental laws and regulations can affect the resale value or significantly reduce the useful lives of the Company&#8217;s vessels, require a reduction in carrying capacity, ship modifications, or operational changes or restrictions (and related increased operating costs) or retirement of service, lead to decreased availability or higher cost of insurance coverage for environmental matters, or result in the denial of access to, or detention in, certain jurisdictional waters or ports. Under local, national and foreign laws, as well as international treaties and conventions, OSG could incur material liabilities, including cleanup obligations, natural resource damages, fines and penalties in the event that there is a release of oil, petroleum or other hazardous substances from its vessels or otherwise in connection with its operations. OSG could be subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to the release of or exposure to hazardous materials associated with its current or historic operations. Violations of or liabilities under environmental requirements also can result in substantial penalties, fines and other sanctions, including in certain instances, seizure or detention of the Company&#8217;s vessels. 
It can be expected that these regulations will continue to become stricter in the future and will require the Company to incur significant capital expenditures to keep its vessels in compliance, or even to scrap or sell certain vessels altogether. Such expenditures could result in financial and operational impacts that may be material to OSG&#8217;s financial condition. The failure to comply with local, domestic and foreign regulations may subject the Company to increased liability, may invalidate existing insurance or decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports. 
The Company&#8217;s business would be adversely affected if it failed to comply with the Jones Act&#8217;s limitations on U.S. coastwise trade, or if these limitations were waived, modified or repealed, or if changes in international trade agreements were to occur. 
The Company is responsible for monitoring the foreign ownership of its common stock and other interests to ensure compliance with the Jones Act. The Company could lose the privilege of owning and operating vessels in the Jones Act trade if non-U.S. Citizens were to own or control, in the aggregate, more than 25% of the equity interests in the Company. Such loss would have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business and results of operations. In addition, failure to comply with the Jones Act could result in the Company being deemed to have violated other U.S. federal laws that prohibit a foreign transfer of U.S. documented vessels without government approval, resulting in severe penalties, including permanent loss of U.S. coastwise trading privileges or forfeiture of the vessels deemed transferred, and fines. 
Maritime transportation services are currently excluded from the General Agreement on Trade in Services (&#8220;GATS&#8221;) and are the subject of reservations by the United States in the North American Free Trade Agreement (&#8220;NAFTA&#8221;) and other international free trade agreements. If maritime transportation services were included in GATS, NAFTA or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise repealed or altered, the transportation of maritime cargo between U.S. ports could be opened to international flag or foreign built vessels. Interest groups regularly lobby Congress, and legislation has been introduced, to repeal certain provisions of the Jones Act or to grant extensive waivers so as to facilitate international flag competition for trades and cargoes currently reserved for U.S. Flag vessels under the Jones Act. The Company expects that continued efforts will be made to modify, repeal, or waive the Jones Act. Because international vessels may have lower construction costs, wage rates and operating costs, this could significantly increase competition in the coastwise trade, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
The U.S. government could requisition the Company&#8217;s vessels during a period of war or emergency, which may negatively impact the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and available cash. 
The U.S. government could requisition one or more of the Company&#8217;s vessels for title or hire, typically occurring during a period of war or emergency. OSG participates in the Maritime Security Program for such purposes. The U.S. government requisition of one or more of the Company&#8217;s vessels could impact the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and available cash if the charter rates we receive from the government while on requisition are less than the charter rates that are being replaced, or if the government refuses to pay the requisition charter rate. 
The employment of the Company&#8217;s vessels could be adversely affected by an inability to clear the oil majors&#8217; risk assessment processes. 
The major oil companies have developed strict due diligence processes for selecting their shipping partners out of concerns for the environmental impact of spills. This vetting process has evolved into a sophisticated and comprehensive risk assessment of both the vessel manager and the vessel. The Company&#8217;s charterers require that the Company&#8217;s vessels and the technical managers pass vetting inspections and management audits. The failure of the Company&#8217;s vessels or managers to maintain these standards could put the Company in breach of the applicable charter agreement and lead to termination of such agreement, thereby adversely affecting revenues. 
Transfers or issuances of the Company&#8217;s equity may impair or reduce the Company&#8217;s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes in the future. 
Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an &#8220;ownership change&#8221; to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change. An &#8220;ownership change&#8221; is generally defined as any change in ownership of more than 50% of a corporation&#8217;s stock over a rolling three-year period by stockholders that own (directly or indirectly) 5% or more of the stock of a corporation or arising from a new issuance of stock by a corporation. If an ownership change occurs, Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the use of pre-ownership change net operating losses, credits and certain other tax attributes to offset taxable income earned after the ownership change. The annual limitation is equal to the product of the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate and the value of the company&#8217;s stock immediately before the ownership change. This annual limitation may be adjusted to reflect any unused annual limitation for prior years and certain recognized built-in gains and losses for the year. In addition, Section 383 generally limits the amount of tax liability in any post-ownership change year that can be reduced by pre-ownership change tax credit carryforwards. If the Company were to undergo an &#8220;ownership change,&#8221; and therefore become subject to limitations described above, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our business, including our operating results and financial condition, are subject to a wide variety of risks, including risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial but that could materially and adversely affect our business. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained in our filings with the SEC, including our financial statements and related notes. Actual dollar amounts are used in this section. 
Risks Related to the COVID-19 pandemic 
The Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
COVID-19 has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response. Such measures have included restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the future adversely impact the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact the Company&#8217;s operational and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company&#8217;s control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition or relaxation of protective public safety measures, and the continuing impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for petroleum products. Additional future impacts on the Company may include, but are not limited to, material adverse effects on demand for the Company&#8217;s vessels, the Company&#8217;s ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company&#8217;s financial results.
We have experienced, and there are heightened risks that we will continue to experience for the foreseeable future relating to: (i) unpredictable fluctuations in demand; (ii) uncertainties in the oil trading markets, with volatile and unpredictable oil pricing; (iii) heightened risk of off-hire periods resulting from managing virus-related delays; (iv) incurring costs for testing, cleaning, quarantine, immunization and certifications; (v) ability to comply with what are evolving, and sometimes conflicting, logistical health and safety protocols. (vi) difficulty in easily accessing critical supplies such as face masks and other personal protective equipment; (vii) risks related to the reliability and effectiveness of testing methodologies and PPE; (viii) delays in receiving critical supplies, in receiving services of specialized technicians and inspectors, and in concluding vetting of the vessels; (ix) restrictions on travel to or from countries in which OSG operates, or the inability to access certain areas; (x) reduced availability of airlines and other transportation modes to move our crews into position and increased costs associated with such travel; (xi) challenges getting crew to and from the vessels in a manner that both protects their personal safety and endeavors to assure that a joining crew member is not bringing COVID-19 onboard or is otherwise affecting a vessel&#8217;s acceptability in service; (xii) increased costs to develop, implement and enforce policies and procedures to deal with all of these challenges; and (xiii) restricted port policies for pilots, tugs and inspections. 
Further risks relate to potential longer-term impacts of the pandemic on our Jones Act trade. The models we typically use to forecast demand may not be reliable in the wake of this health emergency. The shape and speed of fuel demand recovery could have significant negative impacts on our key customers, refineries in particular, which would likely have a material impact on both domestic tank vessel demand as well as on OSG&#8217;s expected forward revenue streams. 
During most of 2021 we had seven vessels in layup. As of December 31, 2021, we had four vessels remaining in layup. As of March 1, 2022, two additional vessels have been placed back into service due to increased demand and two v essels remain in layup. While laying up a vessel mitigates our risks and lowers our cost, there are costs involved and no offsetting revenue.
Risks Related to Our Company 
The Company has incurred significant indebtedness, may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of its indebtedness, and could breach covenants in its credit facilities and term loans which could affect our ability to finance operations, pursue desirable business opportunities and successfully run the business in the future, all of which could affect OSG&#8217;s ability to fulfill its obligations. 
The Company&#8217;s earnings, cash flow and the market value of its vessels vary significantly due to direct impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, general economic, competitive and market conditions affecting the industry, the cyclical nature of the tanker industry, and legislative and regulatory actions - factors beyond the control of the Company. The amount of debt that OSG can manage in some periods may not be appropriate for other periods and OSG&#8217;s ability to meet the financial covenants to which it is subject or may be subject in the future may be at risk. Any insufficiency could negatively impact OSG&#8217;s business.
Insufficiencies in earnings, cash flow and market value of the vessels could require the Company to make mandatory payments or cause the Company to breach certain covenants. If the Company is unable to remedy the relevant breach or obtain a waiver, the Company&#8217;s lenders could accelerate its debts and foreclose on the Company&#8217;s owned vessels. 
If OSG does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy its debt obligations, it may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as selling tankers or other assets, reducing or delaying investments and capital expenditures, refinancing or restructuring its debt, and/or seeking to raise additional capital. The Company&#8217;s ability to restructure or refinance its debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets, its access to such markets and its financial condition at that time. Any future refinancing of debt could be at higher interest rates and might require the Company to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict OSG&#8217;s business operations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict OSG from adopting certain alternatives. These potential undertakings and alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit OSG to meet its scheduled debt service obligations. 
As of December 31, 2021, OSG had $444.7 million of outstanding indebtedness. This substantial indebtedness and interest expense could have important consequences, including (i) limiting OSG&#8217;s ability to use cash flow from operations in other areas of its business, such as for working capital, because a substantial portion of these funds are dedicated to service its debt; (ii) requiring the Company to seek to incur additional indebtedness in order to make planned capital expenditures and other expenses or investments; (iii) limiting OSG&#8217;s ability to obtain additional financing; (iv) limiting the Company&#8217;s flexibility and ability to capitalize on business opportunities or to react to competitive pressures and adverse changes in government regulation, and OSG&#8217;s business and industry; (v) increasing OSG&#8217;s vulnerability to a downturn and to adverse economic and industry conditions generally; and (vi) limiting the Company&#8217;s ability to enter into hedging transactions by reducing the number of counterparties with whom OSG can enter into such transactions as well as the volume of those transactions.
The Company&#8217;s inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its debt obligations, to meet its financial covenants, to reduce debt, and/or to obtain alternative financing, could materially and adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
The Company&#8217;s significant operating leases will be reduced or could be replaced on less favorable terms, and a portion of the vessels leased are in layup. 
The Company&#8217;s fleet includes ten vessels that have been chartered-in under operating leases. The Company did not exercise options to renew the bareboat charters for three of these ten vessels, which will come into effect in December 2022 and will result in a reduced fleet size. The remaining seven leases expire at various points in the future and may not be replaced at all or on as favorable terms. One o f the vessels is currently in layup. The bareboat charter hire continues to be due and paid even if the vessel is in layup, with no corresponding revenue. These circumstances could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s future financial position, profitability, and results of operations and cash flow.
Changes in demand in specialized markets in which the Company currently operates or changes in governmental support may lead the Company to redeploy certain vessels to other markets or put its ability to participate in specialized markets at risk. 
The Company conducts lightering operations in the Delaware Bay with one ATB built for these operations. If there is lower demand for this vessel in the Delaware Bay lightering market, the Company might have to redeploy this ATB in other markets in which it may not be able to compete profitably and/or may require substantial modification. In addition, the Company would be required to pay daily liquidated damages to MARAD if this vessel was deployed in the contiguous coastwise trades. 
The Company has two vessels participating in the MSP which derive a substantial percentage of revenues earned from transporting cargoes reserved for U.S. Flag vessels under MARAD&#8217;s cargo preference program, which is set up to be compliant with certain laws and regulations that require shippers to give U.S.-flag vessels a preference to transport any government-impelled ocean borne cargoes. Among the currently available government&#8211;impelled cargoes is a contract the Company has with the Government of Israel (&#8220;GOI&#8221;) to deliver fuel through December 31, 2022, which the GOI funds with grants from the U.S. government. The Company also seeks other government&#8211;impelled cargoes to supplement the GOI business; however, there is no assurance the Company will be able to secure such cargoes. If the OSG is unable to retain the GOI business or is unable to obtain significant other charters for these vessels, the Company may no longer be able to participate in the MSP. 
The Company operates three Jones Act MR Shuttle Tankers, two of which are currently operating as shuttle tankers serving offshore oil installations in the Gulf of Mexico. Modifications made to enable these tankers to perform the specialized service of a shuttle tanker required the Company to incur substantial capital costs, which in turn allow the Company to earn a premium to market rates earned by conventional Jones Act tankers. The customers with wells and fields in the Gulf of Mexico have high cash production costs and, as such, are vulnerable to production cuts or shut down in response to persistently low oil prices. While shuttle tankers can serve as conventional tankers without further modification, future reduction in the demand for specialized shuttle tanker services could limit the Company&#8217;s ability to earn such premiums. 
If OSG is no longer able to participate in any of these niche businesses, the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected. 
Changes in demand have affected Time Charter commitments. OSG may not be able to renew Time Charters when they expire or enter into new Time Charters and vessels may be placed in layup. 
As a direct result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on OSG&#8217;s business, our customers have been reluctant to commit to long-term Time Charters while the markets remain uncertain. OSG&#8217;s ability to obtain new charters or renew expiring contracts will depend on the prevailing market conditions. Renewals or new contracts may be at less favorable rates or for shorter duration. There may be a gap in employment between charters or the vessel may only be able to be employed on the spot market, both of which would affect utilization rates and result in increased costs to the Company. When there is no demand for a vessel, there is also a risk of the necessity to layup the vessel, as demonstrated during the course of 2021. These occurrences would adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Inability to attract or retain qualified mariners may adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the market for qualified mariners. Competition from other shipping sectors, such as container shipping, has led to increasing demand for certain mariners and higher wages being offered potentially detracting certain mariners from OSG&#8217;s business. During 2021 while some of OSG&#8217;s fleet was laid-up, many of our mariners were laid off and may have found alternative employment elsewhere. Our vessels must be manned by qualified mariners that meet the standards of experience set by our customers. If we are unable to attract or retain qualified mariners, we may not be able to provide the services contracted for, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.
The Company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from a limited number of customers and is subject to credit risks, and the loss of, or reduction in business by, any of these customers could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. 
The Company&#8217;s largest customers account for a significant portion of its revenues. The Company&#8217;s top two customers comprised approximately 38.8% of the Company&#8217;s revenues during 2021. Changes in the broader market, such as closures of U.S. refining facilities, have occurred that reduce the locations to and from which oil is delivered or refined oil is sourced.
The Company has entered into, and in the future will enter into, various contracts associated with the operation of its vessels. The ability of each of the Company&#8217;s customers, lenders, suppliers, and other counterparties to perform their obligations will depend on a number of factors that are beyond the Company&#8217;s control and may include general economic conditions; availability of debt or equity financing; the condition of the maritime and offshore industries; the financial condition of the counterparty; charter rates received for specific types of vessels; and volatile expenses in obtaining supplies. Charterers are sensitive to the commodity markets and may be impacted by market forces affecting commodities such as oil. In addition, as we are currently experiencing, in depressed market conditions, the Company&#8217;s charterers and customers may no longer need a vessel that had been under charter or contract or may be able to obtain a comparable vessel at lower rates, or adverse financial conditions may inhibit these entities from entering into new commitments with OSG. As a result, the Company&#8217;s customers may fail to pay charter hire or attempt to renegotiate charter rates. If the counterparties fail to meet their obligations, the Company could suffer losses on such contracts which would decrease revenues, cash flows and earnings.
These factors could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s revenues, profitability and cash flows, as well as its borrowing ability and financial condition. The loss of, or reduction in business by, any of these customers and refinery locations could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition and results of operations.
Operating costs and capital expenses will increase as the Company&#8217;s vessels age and due to unexpected drydocks. 
In general, capital expenditures, cargo insurance rates and other costs necessary for maintaining a vessel in good operating condition increase as the age of the vessel increases. Changes in governmental regulations and compliance with Classification Society standards may restrict the type of activities in which the vessels may engage and/or may require OSG to make additional expenditures for new equipment. Vessels must be drydocked periodically for inspection and maintenance, and in the event of accidents or other unforeseen damage. The cost of repairs and renewals required at each drydock are difficult to predict with certainty but can be substantial, and the Company&#8217;s insurance may not cover these costs. Vessels in drydock will generally not generate any income. In addition, the time when a vessel is out of service for maintenance is determined by a number of factors including regulatory deadlines, market conditions, shipyard availability and customer requirements. 
As a result of these factors, OSG may be required to incur substantial costs or take its vessels out of service. Market conditions may not justify such expenditures or permit OSG to operate its vessels profitably even if those vessels remain operational. These cost increases, delays, expenses and off-hire time could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Interruption, failure or breach of OSG&#8217;s information technology and communications systems could impair its ability to operate and adversely affect its business. 
OSG has both on-shore and ship-board systems that are highly dependent on information technology systems. The Company collects, stores and transmits data using both internal information technology systems and those of third-party vendors. The secure storage, processing, maintenance, and transmission of sensitive data, including our own proprietary business information and that of our customers, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, is critical to the Company&#8217;s operations. 
Information technology and communication systems are subject to reliability issues, integration and compatibility concerns, and security-threatening intrusions. OSG may experience failures caused by the occurrence of natural disasters, computer hacking or viruses or other unanticipated problems at OSG&#8217;s facilities, aboard its vessels or at third-party locations. OSG&#8217;s network, or those of our clients or third-party vendors, could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, or targeted attacks intended to steal or destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage. 
The Company may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against these threats or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. Security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, litigation and other possible liabilities and could also cause customers to lose confidence in our systems. 
OSG has not experienced any material cyber security violation or occurrence over the last three years, and we invest time, effort and financial resources to secure our systems, networks and communications. However, these activities cannot provide absolute assurance that we will be successful in preventing or responding to all cyber security attacks. Any failure of OSG&#8217;s or third-party systems could result in interruptions in service, reductions in its revenue and profits, damage to our reputation and brand, or liability for the release of confidential information, and there can be no assurance that any breach or incident will not have a material impact on our operations and financial results.
Delays or disruptions in implementing new technological and management systems could impair the Company&#8217;s ability to operate and adversely affect its business. 
The Company is currently in the process of transitioning to a new software system for managing ship operations. From time to time the Company implements new systems or upgrades technological resources utilized in running its business. The transition to new technology requires a significant investment in capital and personnel resources and the coordination of numerous software and system providers and internal business teams. The Company may experience difficulties as it manages these changes and transitions to a new system and upgrades its technological resources, including loss or corruption of data, delays, decreases in productivity as personnel implement and become familiar with new systems and processes, and unanticipated expenses. Additionally, the Company could be adversely affected if the new software system it is implementing for managing ship operations or other new or upgraded technological resource are defective, not installed properly, fail to perform as marketed or are not properly integrated into existing operations. In addition, the implementation of a new system may not result in improvements that outweigh the cost of implementation. System implementation failures or operational failures, including unauthorized access by third parties to our new software system (which could have the effects described in the preceding risk factor) could have adverse effects on the Company&#8217;s business, financial position, and ability to operate in a complex industry. 
We could face significant liability if one or more multiemployer plans in which we participate is reported to have underfunded liabilities and we withdraw from participation in one or more multiemployer pension plans in which we participate. 
The Company is a party to collective-bargaining agreements that require contributions to three jointly managed multiemployer pension plans covering seagoing personnel of U.S. Flag vessels. Our required contributions to these plans could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these plans, the inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability, low interest rates, lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. Certain of these multiemployer plans are currently underfunded. Significantly underfunded pension plans are required to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their under-funding. As a result, OSG&#8217;s required contributions to these plans may increase in the future. In addition, a termination of or voluntary withdrawal from or a mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from an underfunded multiemployer pension plan would require OSG to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of such multiemployer pension plan&#8217;s unfunded vested liabilities. See Note 15, &#8220;Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefit Plans,&#8221; to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 for additional information. Requirements to pay increased contributions or withdrawal liabilities could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and results of operations. 
Risks Related to Our Industry 
Volatile changes in supply and demand for oil and refined products, charter rates and vessel values, and the factors that influence such changes, could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s earnings, liquidity and available cash. 
The marine transportation industry is both cyclical and volatile in terms of demand, charter rates and profitability. Fluctuations in charter rates and vessel values result from changes in supply and demand both for tanker capacity and for oil and oil products. Factors affecting these changes in supply and demand are generally outside of the Company&#8217;s control. Aside from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, additional factors influencing the demand for tanker capacity, and impacting our costs and profitability, include: (i) supply and demand for, and availability of energy resources such as oil, oil products and natural gas, which affect customers&#8217; need for vessel capacity; (ii) availability of refining capacity and inventories; (iii) changes in the production levels of crude oil; (iv) increases in the supply of Jones Act vessels without a commensurate increase in demand; (v) global and regional economic and political conditions, including armed conflicts, terrorist activities and strikes, and international sanctions, embargoes, import and export restrictions or nationalizations and wars, such as the situation currently occurring with Ukraine and Russia, that create uncertainties in the supply of and demand for oil; (vi) changes in seaborne and other transportation patterns, including changes in the distances that cargoes are transported, changes in the price of crude oil and changes to the West Texas Intermediate and Brent Crude Oil pricing benchmarks; and (vii) increasing interest globally, from a regulatory and demand viewpoint, in transitioning to carbon neutral energy sources and the development and use of alternative fuels in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that impact the fuel we transport as cargo and use in fueling our own vessels (see further the risk factor, below, relating to compliance with regulations) .
Many of the factors that influence the demand for tanker capacity will also, in the longer term, effectively influence the supply of tanker capacity, since decisions to build new capacity, invest in capital repairs, invest in new technologies or equipment, or to retain in service older capacity are influenced by the general state of the marine transportation industry from time to time. Factors influencing the supply of vessel capacity include (i) the number of newbuild deliveries or the conversion of vessels into or out of transporting oil; (ii) the number of vessels removed from service, such as via recycling, scrapping or conversion to storage; and (iii) the availability and pricing of other energy sources such as natural gas for which tankers can be used or to which construction capacity may be dedicated. 
The nature, timing and degree of changes in industry conditions are unpredictable and could adversely affect the values of the Company&#8217;s vessels or result in significant fluctuations in the amount of charter revenues the Company earns, which could result in significant volatility in OSG&#8217;s quarterly results and cash flows. 
The market value of vessels fluctuates significantly, which could adversely affect OSG&#8217;s liquidity or otherwise adversely affect its financial condition. 
While Jones Act and U.S. Flag vessel market values have, on average, generally declined over the past several years, the market value of Jones Act vessels has fluctuated over time. The fluctuating market values of the vessels can impact the Company&#8217;s liquidity regardless of whether the Company sells or continues to hold the vessels. For example, selling a vessel at a sale price that is less than the vessel&#8217;s carrying amount on the Company&#8217;s financial statements will result in a loss on the sale and a reduction in earnings and surplus. Declining values of the Company&#8217;s vessels could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s liquidity by limiting its ability to raise cash by refinancing vessels. The Company may also experience significant impairment charges upon a decline in vessel value. Any charges relating to such impairments could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. 
Changes in fuel prices may adversely a ffect profits. 
Fuel is a significant expense in the Company&#8217;s shipping operations when vessels are under voyage charter. Accordingly, an increase in the price of fuel may adversely affect the Company&#8217;s profitability if these increases cannot be passed onto customers. Moreover, higher fuel prices could reduce the profitability and competitiveness of the Company&#8217;s business compared to other forms of transportation. The price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside the Company&#8217;s control. 
OSG conducts certain of its operations internationally, which subjects the Company to changing economic, political and governmental conditions abroad that may adversely affect its business. 
The Company conducts certain of its operations internationally, and its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected by changing economic, political and government conditions in the countries and regions where its vessels are employed. OSG must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as environmental regulations requiring investments and upgrades, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, anti-money laundering laws; and anti-competition regulations. OSG&#8217;s operations may also subject its employees and agents to extortion attempts. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on the Company&#8217;s business operations and on the Company&#8217;s ability to transport cargo to one or more countries, and could also materially affect the Company&#8217;s brand, ability to attract and retain employees, international operations, business and operating results. Although OSG has policies and procedures designed to achieve compliance with these laws and regulations, OSG cannot be certain that its employees, contractors, joint venture partners or agents will not violate these policies and procedures. 
Shipping is a business with inherent risks, and OSG&#8217;s insurance may not be adequate to cover its losses. 
OSG&#8217;s vessels and their cargoes are at risk of being damaged or lost due to accidents, bad weather, mechanical failure, human error, and other factors. These hazards may result in death or injury; loss of revenues or property; environmental damage; higher insurance rates; damage to customer relationships and industry reputation; and market disruptions, and delay or rerouting, all of which may also subject OSG to litigation. The operation of tankers has unique operational risks associated with the transportation of oil. An oil spill may cause significant environmental damage and the associated costs could exceed the insurance coverage available to the Company. While the Company carries insurance to protect against certain of these risks, risks may arise against which the Company is not adequately insured. In the past, new and stricter environmental regulations have led to higher costs for insurance covering environmental damage or pollution, and new regulations could lead to similar increases or even make this type of insurance unavailable. 
Terrorism, piracy, or hostilities could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business. 
Although the Company&#8217;s fleet operates mainly in U.S. waters, there are occasions when a vessel may be in an area where terrorist or pirate attacks, or hijacking are a concern. If attacks result in regions in which the Company&#8217;s vessels are deployed being characterized by insurers as &#8220;war risk&#8221; zones or Joint War Committee &#8220;war and strikes&#8221; listed areas, premiums payable for insurance coverage could increase significantly, and such insurance coverage may become difficult to obtain. Crew costs could also increase in such circumstances due to risks of piracy attacks. While OSG believes the charterer remains liable for charter payments when a vessel is seized by pirates, disputes with the charterer may result in the delay or non-payment of charter hire, or cancellation of the charter party. The Company may not be adequately insured to cover losses from these incidents, or an increase in the cost (or unavailability) of insurance for those vessels could have a material adverse impact on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Such attacks may also impact the Company&#8217;s customers, which could impair their ability to make payments to the Company under its charters. 
Terrorism or international hostilities could cause political instability, damage the world economy, adversely affect the availability of and demand for crude oil and petroleum products and adversely affect both the Company&#8217;s ability to charter its vessels and the charter rates payable under any such charters. These factors could also increase the costs to the Company of conducting its business, particularly crew, insurance and security costs, and prevent or restrict the Company from obtaining insurance coverage, all of which could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters 
The Company&#8217;s business would be adversely affected if it failed to comply with the Jones Act&#8217;s limitations on U.S. coastwise trade, or if these limitations were waived, modified or repealed, or if changes in international trade agreements were to occur. 
The Company is responsible for monitoring the foreign ownership of its common stock and other interests to ensure compliance with the Jones Act. The Company could lose the privilege of owning and operating vessels in the Jones Act trade if non-U.S. Citizens were to own or control, in the aggregate, more than 25% of the equity interests in the Company. Such loss would have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business and results of operations. In addition, failure to comply with the Jones Act could result in the Company being deemed to have violated other U.S. federal laws that prohibit a foreign transfer of U.S. documented vessels without government approval, resulting in severe penalties, including permanent loss of U.S. coastwise trading privileges or forfeiture of the vessels deemed transferred, and fines. 
Maritime transportation services are currently excluded from the General Agreement on Trade in Services (&#8220;GATS&#8221;) and are the subject of reservations by the United States in the North American Free Trade Agreement (&#8220;NAFTA&#8221;) and other international free trade agreements. If maritime transportation services were included in GATS, NAFTA or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise repealed or altered, the transportation of maritime cargo between U.S. ports could be opened to international flag or foreign built vessels. Interest groups regularly lobby Congress, and legislation has been introduced, to repeal certain provisions of the Jones Act or to grant extensive waivers so as to facilitate international flag competition for trades and cargoes currently reserved for U.S. Flag vessels under the Jones Act. The Company expects that continued efforts will be made to modify, repeal, or waive the Jones Act. Because international vessels may have lower construction costs, wage rates and operating costs, this could significantly increase competition in the coastwise trade, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
The U.S. government could requisition the Company&#8217;s vessels during a period of war or emergency, which may negatively impact the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and available cash. 
The U.S. government could requisition one or more of the Company&#8217;s vessels for title or hire, typically occurring during a period of war or emergency. OSG participates in the Maritime Security Program for such purposes. The U.S. government requisition of one or more of the Company&#8217;s vessels could impact the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and available cash if the charter rates we receive from the government while on requisition are less than the charter rates that are being replaced, or if the government refuses to pay the requisition charter rate, in which case we would seek recovery through our insurance policies. 
Compliance with complex laws and regulations, including those seeking to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus, and environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the emission of greenhouse gas gases and ballast water treatment, may adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business. 
The Company&#8217;s operations are affected by extensive and changing international, national and local environmental protection laws, regulations, treaties, conventions and standards designed to reduce the risk of oil spills and water pollution and to regulate air emissions, including emission of greenhouse gases. These requirements impose significant capital and operating costs on OSG. In the United States, the Company is subject to the oversight of government agencies including the U.S. Coast Guard, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Maritime Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation. OPA 90 affects all vessel owners shipping oil or hazardous material to, from or within the United States. OPA 90 allows for potentially unlimited liability without regard to fault for owners, operators and bareboat charterers of vessels for oil pollution in U.S. waters. Similarly, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, as amended, which has been adopted by most countries outside of the United States, imposes liability for oil pollution in international waters. Other significant international conventions to which the United States is signatory are the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (&#8220;MARPOL&#8221;), the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (&#8220;SOLAS&#8221;), and the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (&#8220;STCW&#8221;). Additionally, OPA 90 expressly permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to hazardous materials and oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries. Coastal states in the United States have enacted pollution prevention liability and response laws, many providing for unlimited liability.
Due to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries, including the United States, and international organizations, including the IMO and the European Union, have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Regulations and the reporting mechanisms to measure emissions are evolving as they attempt to standardize the reporting of varying operational factors for many types of vessels and conditions, including such measures as the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (&#8220;EEXI&#8221;) and the Carbon Intensity Indicator (&#8220;CII&#8221;). The adoption of such actions could result in significant financial and operational impacts on the Company&#8217;s business and on the global industry, including requiring OSG to install new emission controls, to invest in technologies or equipment to retrofit on our vessels, to acquire allowances or to pay taxes related to its greenhouse gas emissions. See Item 1, &#8220;Business - Environmental, Safety and Security Matters.&#8221;.
In order to comply with laws and regulations, the Company incurs substantial capital and/or operating expenditures and develops contingency arrangements for potential spills or to reduce and control emissions. The Company is in the process of installing ballast water treatment systems on its vessels at substantial capital cost. Although the Company has performed due diligence in choosing the particular systems, there is no assurance that the technologies chosen will perform as expected or be installed without delays.
Environmental laws and regulations can affect the resale value or significantly reduce the useful lives of the Company&#8217;s vessels, require a reduction in carrying capacity, ship modifications or operational changes or restrictions (and related increased operating costs) or retirement of service, lead to decreased availability or higher cost of insurance coverage for environmental matters or result in the denial of access to, or detention in, certain jurisdictional waters or ports. Under local, national and foreign laws, as well as international treaties and conventions, OSG could incur material liabilities, including cleanup obligations, natural resource damages, fines and penalties in the event that there is a release of oil, petroleum or other hazardous substances from its vessels or otherwise in connection with its operations. OSG could be subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to the release of or exposure to hazardous materials associated with its current or historic operations. Violations of or liabilities under environmental requirements also can result in substantial penalties, fines and other sanctions, including in certain instances, seizure or detention of the Company&#8217;s vessels. 
It can be expected that these regulations will continue to become stricter in the future and will require the Company to incur significant capital expenditures to keep its vessels in compliance, or even to scrap or sell certain vessels altogether. Such expenditures could result in financial and operational impacts that may be material to OSG&#8217;s financial statements. The failure to comply with local, domestic and foreign regulations may subject the Company to increased liability, may invalidate existing insurance or decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports. 
The employment of the Company&#8217;s vessels could be adversely affected by an inability to clear the oil majors&#8217; risk assessment process. 
The major oil companies have developed a strict due diligence process for selecting their shipping partners out of concerns for the environmental impact of spills. This vetting process has evolved into a sophisticated and comprehensive risk assessment of both the vessel manager and the vessel. The Company&#8217;s charterers require that the Company&#8217;s vessels and the technical managers pass vetting inspections and management audits. The Company&#8217;s failure to maintain any of its vessels to these standards could put the Company in breach of the applicable charter agreement and lead to termination of such agreement thereby adversely affecting the revenues of the Company. 
Transfers or issuances of the Company&#8217;s equity may impair or reduce the Company&#8217;s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes in the future. 
Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an &#8220;ownership change&#8221; to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change. An &#8220;ownership change&#8221; is generally defined as any change in ownership of more than 50% of a corporation&#8217;s stock over a rolling three-year period by stockholders that own (directly or indirectly) 5% or more of the stock of a corporation or arising from a new issuance of stock by a corporation. If an ownership change occurs, Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the use of pre-ownership change NOLs, credits and certain other tax attributes to offset taxable income earned after the ownership change. The annual limitation is equal to the product of the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate and the value of the company&#8217;s stock immediately before the ownership change. This annual limitation may be adjusted to reflect any unused annual limitation for prior years and certain recognized built-in gains and losses for the year. In addition, Section 383 generally limits the amount of tax liability in any post-ownership change year that can be reduced by pre-ownership change tax credit carryforwards. If the Company were to undergo an &#8220;ownership change,&#8221; it could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our business, including our operating results and financial condition, are subject to a wide variety of risks, including risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial but that could materially and adversely affect our business. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained in our filings with the SEC, including our financial statements and related notes. Actual dollar amounts are used in this section. 
Risks Related to the COVID-19 pandemic 
The COVID-19 pandemic has materially and adversely impacted the global and US economies. The economic headwinds posed by this have impacted our industry and our business and depending upon its duration and severity will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our industry and our business in significant ways, creating new risks and heightening existing risks. The environment within which we operate is, has been, and continues to be under ongoing stress, presenting risks and vulnerabilities that have previously not affected our performance. The level of uncertainty about the extent, duration and ultimate impact of the forces that are currently unsettling our markets has never been greater and will impact how supply, demand and price of crude oil will unfold in the months ahead. Direct management and operational risks exist now and are likely to continue and increase in the future relating to our ability to effectively sustain operational readiness. Maintaining the health of our key employees to operate our vessels and executives to manage the business during this turbulent time is critical. Our ability to adapt and implement policies and procedures in this regard, and to anticipate associated costs, are subject to developing consensus with relevant constituencies, including regulatory authorities, health officials, unions, customers, and those in our industry and supply chain, to achieve consistency and a common approach to coping with the very real and very difficult problems presented by COVID-19. 
We have experienced, and there are heightened risks that we will continue to experience for the foreseeable future relating to: (i) drastic decreases in demand; (ii) uncertainties in the oil trading markets, with volatile and unpredictable oil pricing; (iii) heightened risk of off-hire periods resulting from managing virus-related delays; (iv) incurring costs for testing, cleaning, quarantine, immunization and certifications; (v) ability to comply with what are evolving, and sometimes conflicting, logistical health and safety protocols. (vi) difficulty in easily accessing critical supplies such as face masks and other personal protective equipment; (vii) risks related to the reliability and effectiveness of testing methodologies and PPE; (viii) delays in receiving critical supplies, in receiving services of specialized technicians and inspectors, and in concluding vetting of the vessels; (ix) restrictions on travel to or from countries in which OSG operates, or the inability to access certain areas; (x) reduced availability of airlines and other transportation modes to move our crews into position and increased costs associated with such travel; (xi) challenges getting crew to and from the vessels in a manner that both protects their personal safety and endeavors to assure that a joining crew member is not bringing COVID-19 onboard or is otherwise affecting a vessel&#8217;s acceptability in service; (xii) increased costs to develop, implement and enforce policies and procedures to deal with all of these challenges; and (xiii) restricted port policies for pilots, tugs and inspections. 
Further risks relate to potential longer-term impacts of the pandemic on our Jones Act trade. The models we typically use to forecast demand may not be reliable in the wake of this health emergency. A V-shaped recovery is not expected in transportation fuel demand, with uneven recovery predicted in various fuel sectors. The shape and speed of fuel demand recovery could have significant negative impacts on our key customers, refineries in particular, which would likely have a material impact on both domestic tank vessel demand as well as on OSG&#8217;s expected forward revenue streams. 
As of March 1, 2021, we have seven vessels in layup due to the lack of demand. While laying up a vessel mitigates our risks and lowers our cost, there are costs involved and no offsetting revenue. For those vessels in service, we are experiencing reduced cargo volumes and increased idle times, derivatives of falling refinery runs and unprecedented demand destruction for transportation fuels arising out of stay-at-home policies in many populated regions. 
Volatility in rates is expected to continue. The overall level of crude oil production cuts in the U.S. over the coming months and the impact of these cuts on the relative price differentials between domestic and comparable international crude oil are significant factors for the U.S. trades. Even if energy prices rise, the fact that crude oil production has declined, coupled with the increase of tonnage released back into the market once product stored is delivered for consumption, will likely impact negatively on future rates. We have heightened exposure to risks to those of our vessels operating on the spot market, as rate and utilization assumptions for those vessels must cover a wide range of possible scenarios. 
Risks Related to Our Company 
The Company may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of its indebtedness and could breach covenants in its credit facilities and term loans. 
The Company&#8217;s earnings, cash flow and the market value of its vessels vary significantly due to direct impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, general economic, competitive and market conditions affecting the industry, and the cyclical nature of the tanker industry, with many of these factors beyond the control of the Company. The amount of debt that OSG can manage in some periods may not be appropriate for other periods and OSG&#8217;s ability to meet the financial covenants to which it is subject or may be subject in the future may be at risk. Any insufficiency could negatively impact OSG&#8217;s business. 
The term loan, due 2023, contains certain restrictions relating to new borrowings, the movement of funds between OBS and OSG, and financial covenants. Other financings to which OSG is a party contain similar restrictions and financial covenants. Insufficiencies in earnings, cash flow and market value of the vessels could require the Company to make mandatory payments or cause the Company to breach certain covenants. If the Company is unable to remedy the relevant breach or obtain a waiver, the Company&#8217;s lenders could accelerate its debts and foreclose on the Company&#8217;s owned vessels. 
If OSG does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy its debt obligations, it may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as selling tankers or other assets, reducing or delaying investments and capital expenditures, refinancing or restructuring its debt, and/or seeking to raise additional capital. The Company&#8217;s ability to restructure or refinance its debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets, its access to such markets and its financial condition at that time. Any future refinancing of debt could be at higher interest rates and might require the Company to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict OSG&#8217;s business operations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict OSG from adopting certain alternatives. These potential undertakings and alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit OSG to meet its scheduled debt service obligations. 
The Company&#8217;s inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its debt obligations, to meet its financial covenants and/or to obtain alternative financing in such circumstances, could materially and adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
OSG has incurred significant indebtedness, which could affect our ability to finance operations, pursue desirable business opportunities and successfully run the business in the future, all of which could affect OSG&#8217;s ability to fulfill its obligations under that indebtedness. 
As of December 31, 2020, OSG had $429.1 million of outstanding indebtedness. This substantial indebtedness and interest expense could have important consequences, including (i) limiting OSG&#8217;s ability to use cash flow from operations in other areas of its business, such as for working capital, because a substantial portion of these funds are dedicated to service its debt; (ii) requiring the Company to seek to incur additional indebtedness in order to make planned capital expenditures and other expenses or investments; (iii) limiting OSG&#8217;s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and other expenses or investments planned by the Company; (iv) limiting the Company&#8217;s flexibility and ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures and adverse changes in government regulation, and OSG&#8217;s business and industry; (v) limiting OSG&#8217;s ability to satisfy its obligations under its indebtedness or to refinance its indebtedness; (vi) increasing OSG&#8217;s vulnerability to a downturn and to adverse economic and industry conditions generally; and (vii) limiting the Company&#8217;s ability to enter into hedging transactions by reducing the number of counterparties with whom OSG can enter into such transactions as well as the volume of those transactions. 
OSG&#8217;s ability to continue to fund its obligations and to reduce debt may be affected by general economic, financial market, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, among other things. An inability to fund the Company&#8217;s debt requirements or reduce debt could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
The Company&#8217;s significant operating leases could be replaced on less favorable terms or may not be replaced, and a portion of the vessels leased are in layup . 
The Company&#8217;s fleet includes ten vessels that have been chartered-in under operating leases. Four of the ten vessels are currently in layup. These leases expire at various points in the future and may not be replaced at all or on as favorable terms. The bareboat charter hire continues to be due and paid even if the vessel is in lay-up, with no corresponding revenue. These circumstances could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s future financial position, results of operations and cash flow. 
Changes in demand in specialized markets in which the Company currently operates or changes in governmental support may lead the Company to redeploy certain vessels to other markets or put its ability to participate in specialized markets at risk. 
The Company conducts lightering operations in the Delaware Bay with one ATB built for these operations. If there is lower demand for this vessel in the Delaware Bay lightering market, the Company might have to redeploy this ATB in other markets in which it may not be able to compete profitably and/or may require substantial modification. In addition, the Company would be required to pay daily liquidated damages to MarAd if this vessel was deployed in the contiguous coastwise trades. 
The Company has two vessels participating in the MSP which derive a substantial percentage of revenues earned from transporting cargoes reserved for U.S. Flag vessels under MarAd&#8217;s cargo preference program, which is set up to be compliant with certain laws and regulations that require shippers to give U.S.-flag vessels a preference to transport any government-impelled ocean borne cargoes. Among the currently available government&#8211;impelled cargoes is a contract the Company has with the Government of Israel (&#8220;GOI&#8221;) to deliver fuel through December 31, 2021, which the GOI funds with grants from the U.S. government. The Company also seeks other government&#8211;impelled cargoes to supplement the GOI business; however, there is no assurance the Company will be able to secure such cargoes. If the OSG is unable to retain the GOI business or is unable to obtain significant other charters for these vessels, the Company may no longer be able to participate in the MSP. 
The Company operates three Jones Act MR Shuttle Tankers, two of which are currently operating as shuttle tankers serving offshore oil installations in the Gulf of Mexico. Modifications made to enable these tankers to perform the specialized service of a shuttle tanker required the Company to incur substantial capital costs, which in turn allow the Company to earn a premium to market rates earned by conventional Jones Act tankers. The customers with wells and fields in the Gulf of Mexico have high cash production costs and, as such, are vulnerable to production cuts or shut down in response to persistently low oil prices. While shuttle tankers can serve as conventional tankers without further modification, future reduction in the demand for specialized shuttle tanker services could limit the Company&#8217;s ability to earn such premiums. 
If OSG is no longer able to participate in any of these niche businesses, the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected. 
OSG may not be able to renew Time Charters when they expire or enter into new Time Charters and vessels may be placed in layup. 
OSG&#8217;s ability to renew expiring contracts or obtain new charters will depend on the prevailing market conditions at the time of renewal. Renewals or new contracts may be at less favorable rates. There may be a gap in employment between charters or the vessel may only be able to be employed on the spot market, both of which would affect utilization rates and result in increased costs to the Company. If there is no demand for a vessel, there is also a risk of the necessity to layup the vessel. These occurrences would adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Constraints on capital availability have adversely affected the tanker industry and OSG&#8217;s business. 
Constraints on capital may adversely affect the financial condition of the Company&#8217;s customers, lenders, suppliers, and others. While OSG seeks to monitor the financial condition of its customers, lenders and suppliers, the availability and accuracy of information about them and the actions that OSG may take to reduce possible losses resulting from the failure of such entities to comply with their contractual obligations may be limited. In addition, adverse financial conditions may inhibit these entities from entering into new commitments with OSG. These factors could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s revenues, profitability and cash flows, as well as its borrowing ability and financial condition. 
The Company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from a limited number of customers, and the loss of, or reduction in business by, any of these customers, should they be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. 
The Company&#8217;s largest customers account for a significant portion of its revenues. The Company&#8217;s top three customers comprised approximately 34.1% of the Company&#8217;s revenues during 2020. The loss of, or reduction in business by, any of these customers could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition and results of operations. 
Operating costs and capital expenses will increase as the Company&#8217;s vessels age and due to unexpected drydocks. 
In general, capital expenditures, cargo insurance rates and other costs necessary for maintaining a vessel in good operating condition increase as the age of the vessel increases. Changes in governmental regulations and compliance with Classification Society standards may restrict the type of activities in which the vessels may engage and/or may require OSG to make additional expenditures for new equipment. Vessels must be drydocked periodically for inspection and maintenance, and in the event of accidents or other unforeseen damage. The cost of repairs and renewals required at each drydock are difficult to predict with certainty but can be substantial, and the Company&#8217;s insurance may not cover these costs. Vessels in drydock will generally not generate any income. In addition, the time when a vessel is out of service for maintenance is determined by a number of factors including regulatory deadlines, market conditions, shipyard availability and customer requirements. 
As a result of these factors, OSG may be required to incur substantial costs or take its vessels out of service. Market conditions may not justify such expenditures or permit OSG to operate its vessels profitably even if those vessels remain operational. These cost increases, delays, expenses and off-hire time could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
The Company is subject to credit risks with respect to its counterparties on contracts, and any failure by those counterparties to meet their obligations could cause the Company to suffer losses on such contracts, decreasing revenues and earnings. 
The Company has entered into, and in the future will enter into, various contracts associated with the operation of its vessels. The ability of each of the Company&#8217;s counterparties to perform its obligations under a contract with it will depend on a number of factors that are beyond the Company&#8217;s control and may include, among other things, general economic conditions; availability of debt or equity financing; the condition of the maritime and offshore industries; the financial condition of the counterparty; charter rates received for specific types of vessels; and various expenses. Charterers are sensitive to the commodity markets and may be impacted by market forces affecting commodities such as oil. In addition, as we are currently experiencing, in depressed market conditions, the Company&#8217;s charterers and customers may no longer need a vessel that had been under charter or contract or may be able to obtain a comparable vessel at lower rates. As a result, the Company&#8217;s customers may fail to pay charter hire or attempt to renegotiate charter rates. If the counterparties fail to meet their obligations, the Company could suffer losses on such contracts which would decrease revenues, cash flows and earnings. 
Maritime claimants could arrest OSG&#8217;s vessels, which could interrupt cash flows. 
Crew members, suppliers of goods and services to a vessel, shippers of cargo and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against that vessel for unsatisfied debts, claims or damages. In many jurisdictions, a maritime lien holder may enforce its lien by arresting a vessel through foreclosure proceedings. The arrest or attachment of one or more of the Company&#8217;s vessels could interrupt OSG&#8217;s cash flow and require it to pay a significant amount of money to have the arrest lifted. Claimants could try to assert &#8220;sister ship&#8221; liability against one vessel in the Company&#8217;s fleet for claims relating to another vessel in its fleet which, if successful, could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Interruption, failure or breach of OSG&#8217;s information technology and communications systems could impair its ability to operate and adversely affect its business. 
OSG has both on-shore and ship-board systems that are highly dependent on information technology systems. Information technology and communication systems are subject to reliability issues, integration and compatibility concerns, and security-threatening intrusions. OSG may experience failures caused by the occurrence of natural disasters, computer hacking or viruses or other unanticipated problems at OSG&#8217;s facilities, aboard its vessels or at third-party locations. The Company collects, stores and transmits data using both internal information technology systems and those of third-party vendors. The secure storage, processing, maintenance, and transmission of sensitive data, including our own proprietary business information and that of our customers, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, is critical to the Company&#8217;s operations. OSG&#8217;s network, or those of our clients or third-party vendors, could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, or targeted attacks intended to steal or destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage. 
The Company may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against these threats or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. Security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, litigation and other possible liabilities and could also cause customers to lose confidence in our systems. Any failure of OSG&#8217;s or third-party systems could result in interruptions in service, reductions in its revenue and profits, damage to our reputation and brand, or liability for the release of confidential information. 
Delays or disruptions in implementing new technological and management systems could impair the Company&#8217;s ability to operate and adversely affect its business. 
The Company is currently in the process of transitioning to a new software system for managing ship operations. From time to time the Company implements new systems or upgrades technological resources utilized in running its business. The transition to new technology requires a significant investment in capital and personnel resources and the coordination of numerous software and system providers and internal business teams. The Company may experience difficulties as it manages these changes and transitions to a new system and upgrades its technological resources, including loss or corruption of data, delays, decreases in productivity as personnel implement and become familiar with new systems and processes, and unanticipated expenses. Additionally, the Company could be adversely affected if the new software system it is implementing for managing ship operations or other new or upgraded technological resource are defective, not installed properly, fail to perform as marketed or are not properly integrated into existing operations. In addition, the implementation of a new system may not result in improvements that outweigh the cost of implementation. System implementation failures or operational failures, including unauthorized access by third parties to our new software system (which could have the effects described in the preceding risk factor) could have adverse effects on the Company&#8217;s business, financial position, and ability to operate in a complex industry. 
We could face significant liability if one or more multiemployer plans in which we participate is reported to have underfunded liabilities and we withdraw from participation in one or more multiemployer pension plans in which we participate. 
The Company is a party to collective-bargaining agreements that require contributions to three jointly managed multiemployer pension plans covering seagoing personnel of U.S. Flag vessels. Our required contributions to these plans could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these plans, the inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability, low interest rates, lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. Certain of these multiemployer plans are currently underfunded. Significantly underfunded pension plans are required to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their under-funding. As a result, OSG&#8217;s required contributions to these plans may increase in the future. In addition, a termination of or voluntary withdrawal from or a mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from an underfunded multiemployer pension plan would require OSG to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of such multiemployer pension plan&#8217;s unfunded vested liabilities. See Note 16, &#8220;Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefit Plans,&#8221; to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 for additional information. Requirements to pay increased contributions or withdrawal liabilities could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and results of operations. 
Risks Related to Our Industry 
Volatile changes in charter rates and vessel values could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s earnings, liquidity and available cash. 
The marine transportation industry is both cyclical and volatile in terms of demand, charter rates and profitability. Fluctuations in charter rates and vessel values result from changes in supply and demand both for tanker capacity and for oil and oil products. Factors affecting these changes in supply and demand are generally outside of the Company&#8217;s control. Aside from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, additional factors influencing the demand for tanker capacity include: (i) supply and demand for, and availability of energy resources such as oil, oil products and natural gas, which affect customers&#8217; need for vessel capacity; (ii) availability of refining capacity and inventories; (iii) changes in the production levels of crude oil; (iv) increases in the supply of Jones Act vessels without a commensurate increase in demand; (v) global and regional economic and political conditions, including armed conflicts, terrorist activities and strikes, and international sanctions, embargoes, import and export restrictions or nationalizations and wars that could impact the supply of oil ; (vi) changes in seaborne and other transportation patterns, including changes in the distances that cargoes are transported, changes in the price of crude oil and changes to the West Texas Intermediate and Brent Crude Oil pricing benchmarks; and (vii) competition from alternative sources of energy.
Many of the factors that influence the demand for tanker capacity will also, in the longer term, effectively influence the supply of tanker capacity, since decisions to build new capacity, invest in capital repairs, or to retain in service older capacity are influenced by the general state of the marine transportation industry from time to time. Factors influencing the supply of vessel capacity include (i) the number of newbuild deliveries or the conversion of vessels into or out of transporting oil; (ii) the number of vessels removed from service, such as via recycling, scrapping or conversion to storage; and (iii) the availability and pricing of other energy sources such as natural gas for which tankers can be used or to which construction capacity may be dedicated. 
The nature, timing and degree of changes in industry conditions are unpredictable and could adversely affect the values of the Company&#8217;s vessels or result in significant fluctuations in the amount of charter revenues the Company earns, which could result in significant volatility in OSG&#8217;s quarterly results and cash flows.
The market value of vessels fluctuates significantly, which could adversely affect OSG&#8217;s liquidity or otherwise adversely affect its financial condition. 
While Jones Act and U.S. Flag vessel market values have, on average, generally declined over the past several years, the market value of Jones Act vessels has fluctuated over time.
The fluctuating market values of the vessels can impact the Company&#8217;s liquidity regardless of whether the Company sells or continues to hold the vessels. For example, selling a vessel at a sale price that is less than the vessel&#8217;s carrying amount on the Company&#8217;s financial statements will result in a loss on the sale and a reduction in earnings and surplus. Declining values of the Company&#8217;s vessels could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s liquidity by limiting its ability to raise cash by refinancing vessels.
The Company may also experience significant impairment charges upon a decline in vessel value. Any charges relating to such impairments could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition.
Changes in fuel prices may adversely affect profits. 
Fuel is a significant, if not the largest, expense in the Company&#8217;s shipping operations when vessels are under voyage charter. Accordingly, an increase in the price of fuel may adversely affect the Company&#8217;s profitability if these increases cannot be passed onto customers. Moreover, higher fuel prices could reduce the profitability and competitiveness of the Company&#8217;s business compared to other forms of transportation. The price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside the Company&#8217;s control.
OSG conducts certain of its operations internationally, which subjects the Company to changing economic, political and governmental conditions abroad that may adversely affect its business. 
The Company conducts certain of its operations internationally, and its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected by changing economic, political and government conditions in the countries and regions where its vessels are employed. OSG must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as environmental regulations requiring investments and upgrades, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, anti-money laundering laws; and anti-competition regulations. OSG&#8217;s operations may also subject its employees and agents to extortion attempts. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on the Company&#8217;s business operations and on the Company&#8217;s ability to transport cargo to one or more countries, and could also materially affect the Company&#8217;s brand, ability to attract and retain employees, international operations, business and operating results. Although OSG has policies and procedures designed to achieve compliance with these laws and regulations, OSG cannot be certain that its employees, contractors, joint venture partners or agents will not violate these policies and procedures.
Shipping is a business with inherent risks, and OSG&#8217;s insurance may not be adequate to cover its losses. 
OSG&#8217;s vessels and their cargoes are at risk of being damaged or lost due to accidents, bad weather, mechanical failure, human error, and other factors. These hazards may result in death or injury; loss of revenues or property; environmental damage; higher insurance rates; damage to customer relationships and industry reputation; and market disruptions, and delay or rerouting, all of which may also subject OSG to litigation. The operation of tankers has unique operational risks associated with the transportation of oil. An oil spill may cause significant environmental damage and the associated costs could exceed the insurance coverage available to the Company.
While the Company carries insurance to protect against certain of these risks, risks may arise against which the Company is not adequately insured. In the past, new and stricter environmental regulations have led to higher costs for insurance covering environmental damage or pollution, and new regulations could lead to similar increases or even make this type of insurance unavailable. 
Terrorism, piracy, or hostilities could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business. 
Although the Company&#8217;s fleet operates mainly in U.S. waters, there are occasions when a vessel may be in an area where terrorist or pirate attacks, or hijacking are a concern. If attacks result in regions in which the Company&#8217;s vessels are deployed being characterized by insurers as &#8220;war risk&#8221; zones or Joint War Committee &#8220;war and strikes&#8221; listed areas, premiums payable for insurance coverage could increase significantly, and such insurance coverage may become difficult to obtain. Crew costs could also increase in such circumstances due to risks of piracy attacks. While OSG believes the charterer remains liable for charter payments when a vessel is seized by pirates, disputes with the charterer may result in the delay or non-payment of charter hire, or cancellation of the charter party. The Company may not be adequately insured to cover losses from these incidents, or an increase in the cost (or unavailability) of insurance for those vessels could have a material adverse impact on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Such attacks may also impact the Company&#8217;s customers, which could impair their ability to make payments to the Company under its charters. 
Terrorism or international hostilities could cause political instability, damage the world economy, adversely affect the availability of and demand for crude oil and petroleum products and adversely affect both the Company&#8217;s ability to charter its vessels and the charter rates payable under any such charters. These factors could also increase the costs to the Company of conducting its business, particularly crew, insurance and security costs, and prevent or restrict the Company from obtaining insurance coverage, all of which could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters 
The Company&#8217;s business would be adversely affected if it failed to comply with the Jones Act&#8217;s limitations on U.S. coastwise trade, or if these limitations were waived, modified or repealed, or if changes in international trade agreements were to occur. 
The Company is responsible for monitoring the foreign ownership of its common stock and other interests to ensure compliance with the Jones Act. The Company could lose the privilege of owning and operating vessels in the Jones Act trade if non-U.S. Citizens were to own or control, in the aggregate, more than 25% of the equity interests in the Company. Such loss would have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business and results of operations. In addition, failure to comply with the Jones Act could result in the Company being deemed to have violated other U.S. federal laws that prohibit a foreign transfer of U.S. documented vessels without government approval, resulting in severe penalties, including permanent loss of U.S. coastwise trading privileges or forfeiture of the vessels deemed transferred, and fines. 
Maritime transportation services are currently excluded from the General Agreement on Trade in Services (&#8220;GATS&#8221;) and are the subject of reservations by the United States in the North American Free Trade Agreement (&#8220;NAFTA&#8221;) and other international free trade agreements. If maritime transportation services were included in GATS, NAFTA or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise repealed or altered, the transportation of maritime cargo between U.S. ports could be opened to international flag or foreign built vessels. Interest groups regularly lobby Congress, and legislation has been introduced, to repeal certain provisions of the Jones Act or to grant extensive waivers so as to facilitate international flag competition for trades and cargoes currently reserved for U.S. Flag vessels under the Jones Act. The Company expects that continued efforts will be made to modify, repeal, or waive the Jones Act. Because international vessels may have lower construction costs, wage rates and operating costs, this could significantly increase competition in the coastwise trade, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
The U.S. government could requisition the Company&#8217;s vessels during a period of war or emergency, which may negatively impact the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and available cash. 
The U.S. government could requisition one or more of the Company&#8217;s vessels for title or hire, typically occurring during a period of war or emergency. The U.S. government requisition of one or more of the Company&#8217;s vessels could impact the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and available cash if the charter rates we receive from the government while on requisition are less than the charter rates that are being replaced, or if the government refuses to pay the requisition charter rate, in which case we would seek recovery through our insurance policies. 
Compliance with complex laws and regulations, including those seeking to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus, and environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the emission of greenhouse gas gases and ballast water treatment, may adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business. 
The Company is subject to the oversight of several government agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Maritime Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation. OPA 90 affects all vessel owners shipping oil or hazardous material to, from or within the United States. OPA 90 allows for potentially unlimited liability without regard to fault for owners, operators and bareboat charterers of vessels for oil pollution in U.S. waters. Similarly, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, as amended, which has been adopted by most countries outside of the United States, imposes liability for oil pollution in international waters. OPA 90 expressly permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to hazardous materials and oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries. Coastal states in the United States have enacted pollution prevention liability and response laws, many providing for unlimited liability. The Company&#8217;s operations are affected by these extensive and changing international, national and local environmental protection laws, regulations, treaties, conventions and standards designed to reduce the risk of oil spills and water pollution and to regulate air emissions, including emission of greenhouse gases. These requirements impose significant capital and operating costs on OSG. 
Due to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries, including the United States, and international organizations, including the IMO and the European Union, have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Such actions could result in significant financial and operational impacts on the Company&#8217;s business, including requiring OSG to install new emission controls, or to acquire allowances or pay taxes related to its greenhouse gas emissions. See Item 1, &#8220;Business - Environmental, Safety and Security Matters.&#8221;.
In order to comply with laws and regulations, the Company incurs substantial capital and/or operating expenditures and develops contingency arrangements for potential spills. The Company is in the process of installing ballast water treatment systems on its vessels at substantial capital cost. Although the Company has performed due diligence in choosing the particular systems, there is no assurance that the technologies chosen will perform as expected or be installed without delays.
Environmental laws and regulations can affect the resale value or significantly reduce the useful lives of the Company&#8217;s vessels, require a reduction in carrying capacity, ship modifications or operational changes or restrictions (and related increased operating costs) or retirement of service, lead to decreased availability or higher cost of insurance coverage for environmental matters or result in the denial of access to, or detention in, certain jurisdictional waters or ports. Under local, national and foreign laws, as well as international treaties and conventions, OSG could incur material liabilities, including cleanup obligations, natural resource damages, fines and penalties in the event that there is a release of oil, petroleum or other hazardous substances from its vessels or otherwise in connection with its operations. OSG could be subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to the release of or exposure to hazardous materials associated with its current or historic operations. Violations of or liabilities under environmental requirements also can result in substantial penalties, fines and other sanctions, including in certain instances, seizure or detention of the Company&#8217;s vessels. 
It can be expected that these regulations will continue to become stricter in the future and will require the Company to incur significant capital expenditures to keep its vessels in compliance, or even to scrap or sell certain vessels altogether. Such expenditures could result in financial and operational impacts that may be material to OSG&#8217;s financial statements. The failure to comply with local, domestic and foreign regulations may subject the Company to increased liability, may invalidate existing insurance or decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports. 
The employment of the Company&#8217;s vessels could be adversely affected by an inability to clear the oil majors&#8217; risk assessment process. 
The major oil companies have developed a strict due diligence process for selecting their shipping partners out of concerns for the environmental impact of spills. This vetting process has evolved into a sophisticated and comprehensive risk assessment of both the vessel manager and the vessel. The Company&#8217;s charterers require that the Company&#8217;s vessels and the technical managers pass vetting inspections and management audits. The Company&#8217;s failure to maintain any of its vessels to these standards could put the Company in breach of the applicable charter agreement and lead to termination of such agreement thereby adversely affecting the revenues of the Company. 
Transfers or issuances of the Company&#8217;s equity may impair or reduce the Company&#8217;s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes in the future. 
Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an &#8220;ownership change&#8221; to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change. An &#8220;ownership change&#8221; is generally defined as any change in ownership of more than 50% of a corporation&#8217;s stock over a rolling three-year period by stockholders that own (directly or indirectly) 5% or more of the stock of a corporation or arising from a new issuance of stock by a corporation. If an ownership change occurs, Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the use of pre-ownership change NOLs, credits and certain other tax attributes to offset taxable income earned after the ownership change. The annual limitation is equal to the product of the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate and the value of the company&#8217;s stock immediately before the ownership change. This annual limitation may be adjusted to reflect any unused annual limitation for prior years and certain recognized built-in gains and losses for the year. In addition, Section 383 generally limits the amount of tax liability in any post-ownership change year that can be reduced by pre-ownership change tax credit carryforwards. If the Company were to undergo an &#8220;ownership change,&#8221; it could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Some provisions of Delaware law and the Company&#8217;s governing documents could influence its ability to effect a change of control. 
Certain provisions of Delaware law and contained in the Company&#8217;s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of the Company. These provisions could make it more difficult to bring about a change in the composition of the Company&#8217;s board of directors. For example, the Company&#8217;s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws (i) give the sole ability to then-current members of its board of directors to fill a vacancy on the board of directors; (ii) require the affirmative vote of two-thirds or more of the combined voting power of the outstanding shares of its capital stock in order to amend or repeal certain provisions of its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws; and (iii) establish advance notice requirements for nomination for elections to its board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. In addition, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation contains restrictions on foreign ownership of the Company&#8217;s common stock. These restrictions could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of the Company. 
Separately, the Company has elected to opt out of Section 203 (&#8220;Section 203&#8221;) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the &#8220;DGCL&#8221;), which restricts certain business combinations between a Delaware corporation and an &#8220;interested stockholder.&#8221; Accordingly, the Company will be able to enter into such transactions with its principal stockholders without complying with the requirements of Section 203. The election to opt out of Section 203 could deprive certain stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of the Company, particularly if it enters into a transaction with an &#8220;interested stockholder.&#8221;

Risks Related to Our Industry 
The highly cyclical nature of supply and demand in the industry may lead to volatile changes in charter rates and vessel values, which could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s earnings, liquidity and available cash. 
The marine transportation industry is both cyclical and volatile in terms of charter rates and profitability. Fluctuations in charter rates and vessel values result from changes in supply and demand both for tanker capacity and for oil and oil products. Factors affecting these changes in supply and demand are generally outside of the Company&#8217;s control. The nature, timing and degree of changes in industry conditions are unpredictable and could adversely affect the values of the Company&#8217;s vessels or result in significant fluctuations in the amount of charter revenues the Company earns, which could result in significant volatility in OSG&#8217;s quarterly results and cash flows. Factors influencing the demand for tanker capacity include: 
Many of the factors that influence the demand for tanker capacity will also, in the longer term, effectively influence the supply of tanker capacity, since decisions to build new capacity, invest in capital repairs, or to retain in service older capacity are influenced by the general state of the marine transportation industry from time to time. Factors influencing the supply of vessel capacity include: 
The market value of vessels fluctuates significantly, which could adversely affect OSG&#8217;s liquidity or otherwise adversely affect its financial condition. 
Jones Act and U.S. Flag vessel market values have, on average, generally declined over the past several years; however, the market value of Jones Act vessels has fluctuated over time and is based upon various factors, including: 
The fluctuating market values of the vessels can impact the Company&#8217;s liquidity regardless of whether the Company sells the vessels or continues to hold the vessels. For example, if OSG sells a vessel at a sale price that is less than the vessel&#8217;s carrying amount on the Company&#8217;s financial statements, OSG will incur a loss on the sale and a reduction in earnings and surplus. On the other hand, declining values of the Company&#8217;s vessels could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s liquidity by limiting its ability to raise cash by refinancing vessels. 
Even if the Company does not need immediate liquidity from the sale or refinancing of vessels, the Company may experience significant impairment charges upon a decline in vessel value. The Company evaluates events and changes in circumstances that have occurred to determine whether they indicate that the carrying amount of the vessels might not be recoverable. This review for potential impairment indicators and projection of future cash flows related to the vessels is complex and requires the Company to make various estimates, including future freight rates, the markets in which the vessels are expected to operate, earnings from the vessels, market appraisals and discount rates, all of which have historically been volatile. The Company evaluates the recoverable amount of a vessel as the sum of its undiscounted estimated future cash flows. If the recoverable amount is less than the vessel&#8217;s carrying amount, the vessel&#8217;s carrying amount is then compared to its estimated fair value, which is determined using vessel appraisals or discounted estimated future cash flows. If the vessel&#8217;s carrying amount is less than its fair value, it is deemed impaired. The carrying values of the Company&#8217;s vessels may differ significantly from their fair market value. Any charges relating to such impairments could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. 
An increase in the supply of Jones Act vessels without a commensurate increase in demand for such vessels could cause charter rates to decline, which could adversely affect OSG&#8217;s revenues, profitability and cash flows, as well as the value of its vessels. 
The marine transportation industry has historically been highly cyclical, as the profitability and asset values of companies in the industry have fluctuated based on changes in the supply of and demand for vessels. If the number of new ships of a particular class delivered exceeds the number of vessels of that class being scrapped, available capacity in that class will increase. Given the smaller number of tankers operating in the U.S. domestic market, the impact of even a limited increase in capacity supply may negatively affect the market and may have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s revenues, profitability and cash flows. 
OSG conducts certain of its operations internationally, which subjects the Company to changing economic, political and governmental conditions abroad that may adversely affect its business. 
The Company conducts certain of its operations internationally, and its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected by changing economic, political and government conditions in the countries and regions where its vessels are employed. 
OSG must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, anti-money laundering laws; and anti-competition regulations. Moreover, the shipping industry is generally considered to present elevated risks in these areas. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on the Company&#8217;s business operations and on the Company&#8217;s ability to transport cargo to one or more countries, and could also materially affect the Company&#8217;s brand, ability to attract and retain employees, international operations, business and operating results. Although OSG has policies and procedures designed to achieve compliance with these laws and regulations, OSG cannot be certain that its employees, contractors, joint venture partners or agents will not violate these policies and procedures. OSG&#8217;s operations may also subject its employees and agents to extortion attempts. 
Changes in fuel prices may adversely affect profits. 
Fuel is a significant, if not the largest, expense in the Company&#8217;s shipping operations when vessels are under voyage charter. Accordingly, an increase in the price of fuel may adversely affect the Company&#8217;s profitability if these increases cannot be passed onto customers. The price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside the Company&#8217;s control, including geopolitical developments; supply and demand for oil and gas; actions by OPEC, and other oil and gas producers; war and unrest in oil producing countries and regions; regional production patterns; and environmental concerns. Fuel may become much more expensive in the future, which could reduce the profitability and competitiveness of the Company&#8217;s business compared to other forms of transportation. 
Shipping is a business with inherent risks, and OSG&#8217;s insurance may not be adequate to cover its losses. 
OSG&#8217;s vessels and their cargoes are at risk of being damaged or lost because of events including, but not limited to: 
These hazards may result in death or injury to persons; loss of revenues or property; environmental damage; higher insurance rates; damage to OSG&#8217;s existing customer relationships and industry reputation; and market disruptions, and delay or rerouting, all of which may also subject OSG to litigation. In addition, the operation of tankers has unique operational risks associated with the transportation of oil. An oil spill may cause significant environmental damage and the associated costs could exceed the insurance coverage available to the Company. Compared to other types of vessels, tankers are also exposed to a higher risk of damage and loss by fire, whether ignited by a terrorist attack, collision, or other cause, due to the high flammability and high volume of the oil transported in tankers. Any of these events could result in loss of revenues, decreased cash flows and increased costs. 
While the Company carries insurance to protect against certain of these risks, risks may arise against which the Company is not adequately insured. For example, a catastrophic spill could exceed OSG&#8217;s $1 billion per vessel insurance coverage and have a material adverse effect on its operations. In addition, OSG may not be able to procure adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates in the future, and any particular claim may not be paid by its insurers. In the past, new and stricter environmental regulations have led to higher costs for insurance covering environmental damage or pollution, and new regulations could lead to similar increases or even make this type of insurance unavailable. 
Furthermore, even if insurance coverage is adequate to cover the Company&#8217;s liabilities arising from the loss of a vessel, OSG may not be able to timely obtain a replacement ship. 
OSG may also be subject to calls, or premiums, in amounts based not only on its own claim records but also the claim records of all other members of the protection and indemnity associations through which OSG obtains insurance coverage for tort liability. OSG&#8217;s payment of these calls could result in significant expenses which would reduce its profits and cash flows or cause losses. 
Constraints on capital availability have adversely affected the tanker industry and OSG&#8217;s business. 
Constraints on capital may adversely affect the financial condition of certain of the Company&#8217;s customers, financial lenders and suppliers. Entities that suffer a material adverse impact on their financial condition may be unable or unwilling to comply with their contractual commitments to OSG including the refusal or inability of customers to pay charter hire to OSG or the inability or unwillingness of financial lenders to honor their commitments to lend funds. While OSG seeks to monitor the financial condition of its customers, financial lenders and suppliers, the availability and accuracy of information about the financial condition of such entities and the actions that OSG may take to reduce possible losses resulting from the failure of such entities to comply with their contractual obligations may be limited. Any such failure could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s revenues, profitability and cash flows. In addition, adverse financial conditions may inhibit these entities from entering into new commitments with OSG, which could also have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s revenues, profitability and cash flows. 
The Company also faces other potential constraints on capital relating to counterparty credit risk and constraints on OSG&#8217;s ability to borrow funds. The Company is subject to credit risks with respect to its counterparties on contracts and any failure by these counterparties to meet their obligations could cause the Company to suffer losses on such contracts, decreasing revenues and earnings. OSG has incurred significant indebtedness which could affect its ability to finance its operations, pursue desirable business opportunities and successfully run its business in the future, all of which could affect OSG&#8217;s ability to fulfill its obligations under that indebtedness. 
Public health threats, including the possible coronavirus pandemic, could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s operations and financial results. 
Public health threats and other highly communicable diseases, outbreaks of which have already occurred in various parts of the world near where OSG operates, could adversely impact the Company&#8217;s operations, the operations of the Company&#8217;s customers and the global economy, including the worldwide demand for crude oil and the level of demand for OSG&#8217;s services. Any quarantine of personnel, restrictions on travel to or from countries in which OSG operates, or inability to access certain areas could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s operations. Travel restrictions, operational problems or large-scale social unrest in any part of the world in which OSG operates, or any reduction in the demand for tanker services caused by public health threats in the future, may impact OSG&#8217;s operations and adversely affect the Company&#8217;s financial results. 
Acts of piracy on ocean-going vessels could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business. 
Although the Company&#8217;s fleet operates mainly in U.S. waters, there are occasions when a vessel may be in an area where pirate attacks are a concern. The frequency of pirate attacks on seagoing vessels remains high, particularly in the western part of the Indian Ocean, off the west coast of Africa and in the South China Sea. If piracy attacks result in regions in which the Company&#8217;s vessels are deployed being characterized by insurers as &#8220;war risk&#8221; zones, as the Gulf of Aden has been, or Joint War Committee &#8220;war and strikes&#8221; listed areas, premiums payable for insurance coverage could increase significantly, and such insurance coverage may become difficult to obtain. Crew costs could also increase in such circumstances due to risks of piracy attacks. 
In addition, while OSG believes the charterer remains liable for charter payments when a vessel is seized by pirates, the charterer may dispute this and withhold charter hire until the vessel is released. A charterer may also claim that a vessel seized by pirates was not &#8220;on-hire&#8221; for a certain number of days and it is therefore entitled to cancel the charter party, a claim the Company would dispute. The Company may not be adequately insured to cover losses from these incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, hijacking as a result of an act of piracy against the Company&#8217;s vessels, or an increase in the cost (or unavailability) of insurance for those vessels, could have a material adverse impact on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Such attacks may also impact the Company&#8217;s customers, which could impair their ability to make payments to the Company under its charters. 
Terrorist attacks and international hostilities and instability can affect the tanker industry, which could adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business. 
Terrorist attacks, the outbreak of war, or the existence of international hostilities could damage the world economy, adversely affect the availability of and demand for crude oil and petroleum products and adversely affect both the Company&#8217;s ability to charter its vessels and the charter rates payable under any such charters. In addition, OSG operates in a sector of the economy that is likely to be adversely impacted by the effects of political instability, terrorist or other attacks, war or international hostilities. In the past, political instability has also resulted in attacks on vessels, mining of waterways and other efforts to disrupt international shipping, particularly in the Arabian Gulf region. These factors could also increase the costs to the Company of conducting its business, particularly crew, insurance and security costs, and prevent or restrict the Company from obtaining insurance coverage, all of which could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Risks Related to Our Company 
OSG has incurred significant indebtedness which could affect its ability to finance its operations, pursue desirable business opportunities and successfully run its business in the future, all of which could affect OSG&#8217;s ability to fulfill its obligations under that indebtedness. 
As of December 31, 2019, OSG had $368.0 million of outstanding indebtedness. OSG&#8217;s substantial indebtedness and interest expense could have important consequences, including: 
OSG&#8217;s ability to continue to fund its obligations and to reduce debt may be affected by general economic, financial market, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, among other things. An inability to fund the Company&#8217;s debt requirements or reduce debt could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Additionally, the actual or perceived credit quality of the Company&#8217;s charterers (as well as any defaults by them) could materially affect the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain the additional capital resources that it will require to purchase additional vessels or significantly increase the costs of obtaining such capital. The Company&#8217;s inability to obtain additional financing at a higher-than-anticipated cost, or at all, could materially affect the Company&#8217;s results of operations and its ability to implement its business strategy. 
The Company may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of its indebtedness and could in the future breach covenants in its credit facilities and term loans. 
The Company&#8217;s earnings, cash flow and the market value of its vessels vary significantly over time due to the cyclical nature of the tanker industry, as well as general economic and market conditions affecting the industry. As a result, the amount of debt that OSG can manage in some periods may not be appropriate in other periods and its ability to meet the financial covenants to which it is subject or may be subject in the future may vary. Additionally, future cash flow may be insufficient to meet the Company&#8217;s debt obligations and commitments. Any insufficiency could negatively impact OSG&#8217;s business. 
The term loan, due 2023, term loans, due 2024, and term loan, due 2026, contain certain restrictions relating to new borrowings and, the movement of funds between OBS and OSG, as set forth in the loan agreement. While the Company was in compliance with these requirements as of December 31, 2019, a decrease in vessel values could require the Company to make mandatory payments on its existing term loans or cause the Company to breach certain covenants in future financing agreements that the Company may enter into from time to time. If the Company is unable to make the mandatory prepayments or breaches such covenants and is unable to remedy the relevant breach or obtain a waiver, the Company&#8217;s lenders could accelerate its debt and foreclose on the Company&#8217;s owned vessels. 
A range of economic, competitive, financial, business, industry and other factors will affect future financial performance, and, accordingly, the Company&#8217;s ability to generate cash flow from operations and to pay debt. Many of these factors, such as charter rates, economic and financial conditions in the tanker industry and the economy, the creditworthiness of our customers, or competitive initiatives of competitors, are beyond the Company&#8217;s control. If OSG does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy its debt obligations, it may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as: 
Undertaking alternative financing plans, if necessary, might not allow OSG to meet its debt obligations. The Company&#8217;s ability to restructure or refinance its debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets, its access to such markets and its financial condition at that time. The OBS Term Loan had a maturity date of August 5, 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company refinanced $325.0 million and paid off the remaining balance of the OBS Term Loan. Any future refinancing of debt could be at higher interest rates and might require the Company to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict OSG&#8217;s business operations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict OSG from adopting certain alternatives. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit OSG to meet its scheduled debt service obligations. The Company&#8217;s inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its debt obligations, to meet the covenants of its credit agreements and term loans and/or to obtain alternative financing in such circumstances, could materially and adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Changes in demand in specialized markets in which the Company currently operates or changes in governmental support may lead the Company to redeploy certain vessels to other markets or put its ability to participate in specialized markets at risk. 
The Company deploys its vessels in several niche markets, including lightering in the Delaware Bay. The Company conducts those lightering operations with one ATB which was purpose built for these operations. If there is lower demand for this vessel in the Delaware Bay lightering market, the Company may have to redeploy this ATB in other markets. If that were to occur, the Company may not be able to compete profitably in the new markets, and the ATB may not be able to be redeployed to new markets without substantial modification. In addition, the Company would be required to pay daily liquidated damages to MarAd if this vessel was deployed in the contiguous coastwise trades. 
The Company has two vessels participating in the MSP which derive a substantial percentage of revenues earned from transporting cargoes reserved for U.S. Flag vessels under MarAd&#8217;s Cargo Preference program. The Cargo Preference program works to promote and facilitate a U.S. maritime transportation system and oversees the administration of and compliance with U.S. cargo preference laws and regulations. Those laws require shippers to give U.S.-flag vessels a preference to transport any government-impelled ocean borne cargoes. Government-impelled cargo is cargo that is moving either as a direct result of Federal government involvement, indirectly through financial sponsorship of a Federal program, or in connection with a guarantee provided by the Federal government. 
Among the currently available government&#8211;impelled cargoes is a contract the Company has with the Government of Israel (&#8220;GOI&#8221;) to deliver fuel through December 31, 2020, which the GOI funds with grants from the U.S. government. The Company must seek other government&#8211;impelled cargoes to supplement the GOI business, however, there is no assurance the Company will be able to secure such cargoes. In addition, if the Company is unable to retain the GOI business, or is unable to obtain significant other charters for these vessels, the Company may no longer be able to participate in the MSP and the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected. 
The Company operates three Jones Act MR Shuttle Tankers, two of which are currently operating as shuttle tankers serving offshore oil installations in the Gulf of Mexico. Modifications made to enable these tankers to perform the specialized service of a shuttle tanker required the Company to incur substantial capital costs, which in turn allow the Company to earn a premium to market rates earned by conventional Jones Act tankers. While shuttle tankers can serve as conventional tankers without further modification, future reduction in the demand for specialized shuttle tanker services could limit the Company&#8217;s ability to earn such premiums, which could adversely affect the financial results of the Company as compared to historical results. 
In the highly competitive Jones Act market, OSG may not be able to compete effectively for charters. 
The Company&#8217;s vessels are employed in a highly competitive market. Competition arises from other vessel owners, including major oil companies, which may have substantially greater resources than OSG does. Competition for the transportation of crude oil and other petroleum products depends on price; location; size, age and condition of vessel; and the acceptability of the vessel operator to the charterer. To the extent OSG enters into new geographic regions or provides new services, it may not be able to compete profitably. New markets may involve competitive factors that differ from those of the Company&#8217;s current markets, and the competitors in those markets may have greater financial strength and capital resources than OSG does. 
OSG may not be able to renew Time Charters when they expire or enter into new Time Charters. 
OSG&#8217;s ability to renew expiring contracts or obtain new charters will depend on the prevailing market conditions at the time of renewal. As of December 31, 2019, OSG employed 19 vessels on Time Charters, with 14 of those expiring in 2020, three expiring in 2021, one expiring in 2022 and one expiring in 2025. The Company&#8217;s existing Time Charters may not be renewed at comparable rates or if renewed or entered into, those new contracts may be at less favorable rates. In addition, there may be a gap in employment of vessels between current charters and subsequent charters. If at a time when OSG is seeking to arrange new charters for its vessels, market participants expect that less capacity will be necessary in the future (for example, if it is expected that oil and natural gas prices will decrease in the future, which could suggest that future oil and gas production levels will decline from then-current levels), OSG may not be able to obtain charters at attractive rates or at all. If, upon expiration of the existing Time Charter, OSG is unable to obtain Time Charters or Voyage Charters at desirable rates, the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected. 
OSG may not realize the benefits it expects from future acquisitions or other strategic transactions it may make. 
OSG&#8217;s business strategy includes ongoing efforts to engage in material acquisitions of assets or ownership interests in entities in the tanker industry and of individual tankers. The Company has recently entered into a 10-year bareboat lease of a 20-year old product tanker which entered the market in the second quarter of 2019 and took delivery of two 50,000 DWT class product and chemical tankers in the third quarter of 2019. The Company is also constructing two new 204,000 bbl barges which will come into the market in 2020. The success of OSG&#8217;s acquisitions will depend upon a number of factors, some of which may not be within its control. These factors include OSG&#8217;s ability to: 
OSG intends to finance any future acquisitions by using available cash from operations, entering into leases and through incurrence of debt or bridge financing, either of which may increase its leverage ratios, or by issuing equity, which may have a dilutive impact on its existing stockholders. At any given time, OSG may be engaged in a number of discussions that may result in one or more acquisitions, some of which may be material to OSG as a whole. These opportunities require confidentiality and may involve negotiations that require quick responses by OSG. Although there can be no certainty that any of these discussions will result in definitive agreements or the completion of any transactions, the announcement of any such transaction may lead to increased volatility in the trading price of OSG&#8217;s securities. 
Acquisitions and other transactions can also involve a number of special risks and challenges, including: 
The success of acquisitions or strategic investments depends on the effective integration of newly acquired businesses or assets into OSG&#8217;s current operations. Such integration is subject to risks and uncertainties, including realization of anticipated synergies and cost savings, the ability to retain and attract personnel and customers, the diversion of management&#8217;s attention from other business concerns, risk of non-compliance with internal controls over financial reporting for an acquired company, in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of the acquired company or asset. Further, if a portion of the purchase price of a business is attributable to goodwill and if the acquired business does not perform up to expectations at the time of the acquisition some or all of the goodwill may be written off, adversely affecting OSG&#8217;s earnings. 
The Company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from a limited number of customers, and the loss of, or reduction in business by, any of these customers could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. 
The Company&#8217;s largest customers account for a significant portion of its revenues. The Company&#8217;s top three customers comprised approximately 38% of the Company&#8217;s revenues during 2019. The loss of, or reduction in business by, any of these customers could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition and results of operations. 
Certain potential customers will not use vessels older than a specified age, even if the vessels have been subsequently rebuilt. 
All of the Company&#8217;s existing ATBs were originally constructed more than 25 years ago with the exception of the OSG Vision/OSG 350, OSG Horizon/OSG 351, which were built between 2010 and 2011, respectively. The OSG Endurance and OSG Courageous tugs, which were built in 2011, will be paired with the Company&#8217;s new barges expected to be delivered in the second quarter of 2020 and fourth quarter of 2020. While all of these rebuilt tug-barge units were rebuilt and double-hulled since 1998 and are &#8220;in-class,&#8221; meaning the vessel has been certified by a Classification Society as being built and maintained in accordance with the rules of that Classification Society and complies with the applicable rules and regulations of the vessel&#8217;s country of registry and applicable international conventions, some potential customers have stated that they will not charter vessels that are more than 20 years old, even if they have been rebuilt. Other customers may not continue to view rebuilt vessels as suitable. With an increase in the supply of newer vessels, customers may become more selective. If more customers differentiate rebuilt vessels, time charter rates for the Company&#8217;s rebuilt ATBs will likely be adversely affected. 
The Company&#8217;s significant operating leases could be replaced on less favorable terms or may not be replaced. 
The Company&#8217;s operating fleet includes ten vessels that have been chartered-in under operating leases. The significant operating leases of the Company in its various businesses expire at various points in the future and may not be replaced at all or on as favorable terms, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s future financial position, results of operations and cash flow. 
The Company is subject to credit risks with respect to its counterparties on contracts, and any failure by those counterparties to meet their obligations could cause the Company to suffer losses on such contracts, decreasing revenues and earnings. 
The Company has entered into, and in the future will enter into, various contracts, including charter agreements and other agreements associated with the operation of its vessels. The Company charters its vessels to other parties, who pay the company a daily rate of hire. The Company also enters COAs and Voyage Charters. Historically, the Company has not experienced material problems collecting charter hire, but the risk increases during economic downturns. Additionally, the Company enters into derivative contracts (interest rate swaps and caps) from time to time. As a result, the Company is subject to credit risks. The ability of each of the Company&#8217;s counterparties to perform its obligations under a contract with it will depend on a number of factors that are beyond the Company&#8217;s control and may include, among other things, general economic conditions; availability of debt or equity financing; the condition of the maritime and offshore industries; the overall financial condition of the counterparty including the bankruptcy of the counterparty; charter rates received for specific types of vessels; and various expenses. Charterers are sensitive to the commodity markets and may be impacted by market forces affecting commodities such as oil. In addition, in depressed market conditions, the Company&#8217;s charterers and customers may no longer need a vessel that is currently under charter or contract or may be able to obtain a comparable vessel at lower rates. As a result, the Company&#8217;s customers may fail to pay charter hire or attempt to renegotiate charter rates. If the counterparties fail to meet their obligations, the Company could suffer losses on such contracts which would decrease revenues, cash flows and earnings. 
Operating costs and capital expenses will increase as the Company&#8217;s vessels age and may also increase due to unanticipated events relating to secondhand vessels and the consolidation of suppliers. 
In general, capital expenditures and other costs necessary for maintaining a vessel in good operating condition increase as the age of the vessel increases. As of December 31, 2019, the average age of the Company&#8217;s total owned and operated fleet, with the exception of the Company&#8217;s two rebuilt ATBs was 7.1 years, which is based on the vessels&#8217; year of rebuild, where applicable. Cargo insurance rates are also expected to increase with the age of a vessel. Accordingly, it is likely that the operating costs of OSG&#8217;s currently operated vessels will increase. In addition, changes in governmental regulations and compliance with Classification Society standards may restrict the type of activities in which the vessels may engage and/or may require OSG to make additional expenditures for new equipment. Every commercial tanker must pass inspection by a Classification Society authorized by the vessel&#8217;s country of registry. The Classification Society certifies that a tanker is safe and seaworthy in accordance with the applicable rule and regulations of the country of registry of the tanker and the international conventions of which that country is a number. If a Classification Society requires the Company to add equipment, OSG may be required to incur substantial costs or take its vessels out of service. Market conditions may not justify such expenditures or permit OSG to operate its older vessels profitably even if those vessels remain operational. If a vessel in OSG&#8217;s fleet does not maintain its class and/or fails any survey, then it will be unemployable and unable to trade between ports, which would negatively impact the Company&#8217;s results of operation. 
Furthermore, recent mergers have reduced the number of available suppliers, resulting in fewer alternatives for sourcing key supplies. With respect to certain items, OSG is generally dependent upon the original equipment manufacturer for repair and replacement of the item or its spare parts. Supplier consolidation may result in a shortage of supplies and services, thereby increasing the cost of supplies or potentially inhibiting the ability of suppliers to deliver on time. These cost increases or delays could result in downtime, and delays in the repair and maintenance of the Company&#8217;s vessels and have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
The Company may face unexpected drydock costs for its vessels. 
Vessels must be drydocked periodically for inspection and maintenance, and in the event of accidents or other unforeseen damage. The cost of repairs and renewals required at each drydock are difficult to predict with certainty, can be substantial and the Company&#8217;s insurance may not cover these costs. Vessels in drydock will generally not generate any income. Large drydocking expenses could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the time when a vessel is out of service for maintenance is determined by a number of factors including regulatory deadlines, market conditions, shipyard availability and customer requirements. Large drydocking expenses and longer than anticipated off-hire time could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Technological innovation could reduce the Company&#8217;s charter income and the value of the Company&#8217;s vessels. 
The charter rates and the value and operational life of a vessel are determined by a number of factors including the vessel&#8217;s efficiency, operational flexibility and physical life. Efficiency includes speed, fuel economy and the ability to load and discharge cargo quickly. Flexibility includes the ability to enter harbors, utilize related docking facilities and pass through canals and straits. The length of a vessel&#8217;s physical life is related to its original design and construction, its maintenance and the impact of the stress of operations. Competition from more technologically advanced vessels could adversely affect the amount of charter payments the Company receives for its vessels once their initial charters expire and the resale value of the Company&#8217;s vessels could significantly decrease. As a result, the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. 
Interruption, failure or breach of OSG&#8217;s information technology and communications systems could impair its ability to operate and adversely affect its business. 
OSG is highly dependent on information technology systems. These dependencies include accounting, billing, disbursement, cargo booking and tracking, vessel scheduling and stowage, equipment tracking, customer service, banking, payroll and communication systems. Information technology and communication systems are subject to reliability issues, integration and compatibility concerns, and security-threatening intrusions. OSG may experience failures caused by the occurrence of a natural disaster, computer hacking or viruses or other unanticipated problems at OSG&#8217;s facilities, aboard its vessels or at third-party locations. Any failure of OSG&#8217;s or third-party systems could result in interruptions in service, reductions in its revenue and profits, damage to its reputation or liability for the release of confidential information. 
We collect, store and transmit sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and that of our clients, and personally identifiable information of our clients and employees, using both our information technology systems and those of third-party vendors. The secure storage, processing, maintenance, and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Our network, or those of our clients or third-party vendors, could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, and other security problems. Many companies have increasingly reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage. Cybersecurity issues, such as security breaches and computer viruses, affecting our information technology systems or those of our third-party vendors, could disrupt our business, result in the unintended disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs, and cause losses. 
We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. Security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent security breaches (including the inability of our third party vendors to prevent security breaches) could also cause existing clients to lose confidence in our systems and could adversely affect our reputation, cause losses to us or our clients, damage our brand, and increase our costs. 
Delays or disruptions in implementing new technological and management systems could impair the Company&#8217;s ability to operate and adversely affect its business. 
The Company is currently in the process of transitioning to a new software system for managing ship operations. In addition, from time to time the Company will implement or upgrade certain other technological resources utilized in running its business. Implementation of this new software system will have a significant impact on our business processes and information systems. The transition will require a significant investment in capital and personnel resources and the coordination of numerous software and system providers and internal business teams. The Company may experience difficulties as it manages these changes and transitions to the new system and upgrades its technological resources, including loss or corruption of data, delays, decreases in productivity as personnel implement and become familiar with new systems and processes, and unanticipated expenses. Additionally, the Company could be adversely affected if the new software system it is implementing for managing ship operations or other new or upgraded technological resource are defective, not installed properly, fail to perform as marketed or are not properly integrated into existing operations. In addition, the implementation of a new system may not result in improvements that outweigh the cost of implementation. System implementation failures or operational failures, including unauthorized access by third parties to our new software system (which could have the effects described in the preceding risk factor) and could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial position, and ability to operate in a complex industry. Moreover, difficulties in implementing the new software could disrupt the Company&#8217;s operations or divert management&#8217;s attention from key strategic initiatives. 
We could face significant liability if one or more multiemployer plans in which we participate is reported to have underfunded liabilities and we withdraw from participation in one or more multiemployer pension plans in which we participate. 
The Company is a party to collective-bargaining agreements that requires contributions to three jointly managed (Company and union) multiemployer pension plans covering seagoing personnel of U.S. Flag vessels. Our required contributions to these plans could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these plans, the inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability, low interest rates, lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. Certain of these multiemployer plans are currently underfunded. Significantly underfunded pension plans are required to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their under-funding. As a result, our required contributions to these plans may increase in the future. In addition, a termination of our voluntary withdrawal from or a mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from an underfunded multiemployer pension plan would require us to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of such multiemployer pension plan&#8217;s unfunded vested liabilities. See Note 16, &#8220;Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefit Plans,&#8221; to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 for additional information. Requirements to pay increased contributions or withdrawal liabilities could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and results of operations. 
The Company may have difficulty attracting and retaining skilled employees and is dependent on unionized employees. 
OSG&#8217;s success depends to a significant extent upon the abilities and efforts of its key personnel. The loss of the services of key personnel or the Company&#8217;s inability to attract, motivate and retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition and operating results. 
As of December 31, 2019, OSG had approximately 713 employees, of which 496 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions. See Item 1, &#8220;Business - Employees.&#8221; OSG could be adversely affected by actions taken by employees of OSG or other companies in related industries (including third parties providing services to OSG) against efforts by management to control labor costs, restrain wage or benefits increases or modify work practices or the failure of OSG or other companies in its industry to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements. 
Effective internal controls are necessary for the Company to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. 
The Company maintains a system of internal controls to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The process of designing and implementing effective internal controls is a continuous effort that requires the Company to anticipate and react to changes in its business and the economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy its reporting obligations as a public company. 
Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase the Company&#8217;s operating costs and harm its business. Furthermore, investors&#8217; perceptions that the Company&#8217;s internal controls are inadequate or that the Company is unable to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis may harm its stock price. 
We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities. 
The United States government enacted tax reform in 2017 and continues to provide regulatory guidance related to tax reform provisions, and state authorities continue to provide guidance around its application to tax reform, that could impact future effective tax rates favorably or unfavorably affected by changes in tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. Such changes could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. 
Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters 
The Company&#8217;s business would be adversely affected if it failed to comply with the Jones Act&#8217;s limitations on U.S. coastwise trade, or if these limitations were waived, modified or repealed, or if changes in international trade agreements were to occur. 
Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s operations are conducted in the U.S. coastwise trade and are governed by U.S. federal laws commonly known as the &#8220;Jones Act&#8221;. The Jones Act restricts waterborne transportation of goods between points in the United States to vessels meeting certain requirements, including ownership and control by &#8220;U.S. Citizens&#8221; as defined thereunder. The Company is responsible for monitoring the foreign ownership of its common stock and other interests to ensure compliance with the Jones Act. The Company could lose the privilege of owning and operating vessels in the Jones Act trade if non-U.S. Citizens were to own or control, in the aggregate, more than 25% of the equity interests in the Company. Such loss would have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business and results of operations. In addition, under certain circumstances failure to comply with the Jones Act may result in the Company being deemed to have violated other U.S. federal laws that prohibit a foreign transfer of U.S. documented vessels without government approval, resulting in severe penalties, including permanent loss of U.S. coastwise trading privileges or forfeiture of the vessels deemed transferred, and fines. 
Additionally, maritime transportation services are currently excluded from the General Agreement on Trade in Services (&#8220;GATS&#8221;) and are the subject of reservations by the United States in the North American Free Trade Agreement (&#8220;NAFTA&#8221;) and other international free trade agreements. If maritime transportation services were included in GATS, NAFTA or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise repealed or altered, the transportation of maritime cargo between U.S. ports could be opened to international flag or foreign built vessels. Recently, particularly with regard to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Irma, interest groups have lobbied Congress, and legislation has been introduced, to repeal certain provisions of the Jones Act or to grant extensive waivers so as to facilitate international flag competition for trades and cargoes currently reserved for U.S. Flag vessels under the Jones Act. The Company expects that continued efforts will be made to modify, repeal, or waive the Jones Act. Because international vessels may have lower construction costs, wage rates and operating costs, this could significantly increase competition in the coastwise trade, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
The U.S. government could requisition the Company&#8217;s vessels during a period of war or emergency, which may negatively impact the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and available cash. 
The U.S. government could requisition one or more of the Company&#8217;s vessels for title or hire, typically occurring during a period of war or emergency. Requisition for title or hire occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and becomes the owner or the charterer at dictated charter rates. Two OSG vessels participate in the U.S. Maritime Security Program, which ensures that militarily useful U.S. Flag vessels are available to the U.S. Department of Defense in the event of war or national emergency. Under the program, OSG receives an annual fee, subject in each case to annual Congressional appropriations, in exchange for a guarantee that the ships will be made available to the U.S. government in the time of war or national emergency. The U.S. government requisition of one or more of the Company&#8217;s vessels may impact the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and available cash if the charter rates we receive from the government while on requisition are less than the charter rates that are being replaced, or if the government refuses to pay the requisition charter rate, in which case we would seek recovery through our insurance policies. 
Compliance with complex laws, regulations, and, in particular, environmental laws or regulations may adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business. 
The Company&#8217;s operations are affected by extensive and changing international, national and local environmental protection laws, regulations, treaties, conventions and standards. These requirements are designed to reduce the risk of oil spills and water pollution and to regulate air emissions, including emission of greenhouse gases. These requirements impose significant capital and operating costs on OSG, including those related to engine adjustments and ballast water treatment. 
Environmental laws and regulations also can affect the resale value or significantly reduce the useful lives of the Company&#8217;s vessels, require a reduction in carrying capacity, ship modifications or operational changes or restrictions (and related increased operating costs) or retirement of service, lead to decreased availability or higher cost of insurance coverage for environmental matters or result in the denial of access to, or detention in, certain jurisdictional waters or ports. Under local, national and foreign laws, as well as international treaties and conventions, OSG could incur material liabilities, including cleanup obligations, in the event that there is a release of petroleum or other hazardous substances from its vessels or otherwise in connection with its operations. OSG could be subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to the release of or exposure to hazardous materials associated with its current or historic operations. Violations of or liabilities under environmental requirements also can result in substantial penalties, fines and other sanctions, including in certain instances, seizure or detention of the Company&#8217;s vessels. 
OSG could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs, fines, penalties, third-party claims and natural resource damages, as the result of an oil spill or liabilities under environmental laws. The Company is subject to the oversight of several government agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Maritime Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation. OPA 90 affects all vessel owners shipping oil or hazardous material to, from or within the United States. OPA 90 allows for potentially unlimited liability without regard to fault for owners, operators and bareboat charterers of vessels for oil pollution in U.S. waters. Similarly, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, as amended, which has been adopted by most countries outside of the United States, imposes liability for oil pollution in international waters. OPA 90 expressly permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to hazardous materials and oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries. Coastal states in the United States have enacted pollution prevention liability and response laws, many providing for unlimited liability. 
In order to comply with laws and regulations, shipowners likely will incur substantial additional capital and/or operating expenditures to meet new regulatory requirements, to develop contingency arrangements for potential spills and to obtain insurance coverage. Key regulatory initiatives that are anticipated to require substantial additional capital and/or operating expenditures in the next several years include more stringent limits on the sulfur content of fuel oil for vessels operating in waters not already considered emissions control areas and more stringent requirements for management and treatment of ballast water. 
The Company expects to install ballast water treatment systems on its vessels at substantial capital cost and incur increased operating expenses between 2020 and 2023. Although the Company has performed due diligence in choosing the particular systems, there is no assurance that the technologies chosen will perform as expected or be installed without delays. 
The Company continues to be in full compliance with the USCG&#8217;s phase-in schedule for ballast water treatment systems and has received extensions from the USCG for six vessels. The EPA determined in 2013 that it will not issue extensions under the VGP but stated that vessels that meet certain conditions, including having received the USCG extensions, would be a &#8220;low enforcement priority&#8221;. While the six vessels with USCG extensions are not in compliance with the EPA&#8217;s phase-in schedule, OSG believes that its vessels will meet the conditions for a low enforcement priority.&#8221; However, no assurance is given that EPA will not change their position. If the EPA determines to enforce the limits for such vessels, such action could have a material adverse effect on OSG. See Item 1, &#8220;Business - Environmental, Safety and Security Matters.&#8221; 
Other government regulation of vessels, particularly in the areas of safety and environmental requirements, can be expected to become stricter in the future and require the Company to incur significant capital expenditures on its vessels to keep them in compliance, or even to scrap or sell certain vessels altogether. Such expenditures could result in financial and operational impacts that may be material to OSG&#8217;s financial statements. Additionally, the failure of a shipowner or bareboat charterer to comply with local, domestic and foreign regulations may subject it to increased liability, may invalidate existing insurance or decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports. If any of our vessels are denied access to, or are detained in, certain ports, reputation, business, financial results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. 
Incidents involving highly publicized oil spills and other mishaps involving vessels can be expected in the tanker industry, and such events could be expected to result in the adoption of even stricter laws and regulations, which could limit the Company&#8217;s operations or its ability to do business and which could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial results and cash flows. In addition, the Company is required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain certain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to its operations. The Company believes its vessels are maintained in good condition in compliance with present regulatory requirements, are operated in compliance with applicable safety and environmental laws and regulations and are insured against usual risks for such amounts as the Company&#8217;s management deems appropriate. The vessels&#8217; operating certificates and licenses are renewed periodically during each vessel&#8217;s required annual survey. However, government regulation of tankers, particularly in the areas of safety and environmental impact, may change in the future and require the Company to incur significant capital expenditures with respect to its ships to keep them in compliance. 
Due to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries, including the United States, and international organizations, including the IMO and the European Union, have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These regulatory measures include, among others, adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. Such actions could result in significant financial and operational impacts on the Company&#8217;s business, including requiring OSG to install new emission controls, acquire allowances or pay taxes related to its greenhouse gas emissions, or administer and manage a greenhouse gas emission program. The Company is calculating and reporting greenhouse gas emissions on voyages to and from EU ports under the EU&#8217;s Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) scheme, and a similar requirement has been expanded to all vessels engaged on international voyage under a similar IMO program. See Item 1, &#8220;Business - Environmental, Safety and Security Matters.&#8221; In addition to the added costs, the concern over climate change and regulatory measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may reduce global demand for oil and oil products, which would have an adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial results and cash flows. 
The employment of the Company&#8217;s vessels could be adversely affected by an inability to clear the oil majors&#8217; risk assessment process. 
Our industry is heavily regulated. In addition, the major oil companies have developed a strict due diligence process for selecting their shipping partners out of concerns for the environmental impact of spills. This vetting process has evolved into a sophisticated and comprehensive risk assessment of both the vessel manager and the vessel. The Company&#8217;s charterers require that the Company&#8217;s vessels and the technical managers pass vetting inspections and management audits. The Company&#8217;s failure to maintain any of its vessels to these standards could put the Company in breach of the applicable charter agreement and lead to termination of such agreement thereby adversely affecting the revenues of the Company. 
The Company may be subject to litigation and government inquiries or investigations that, if not resolved in the Company&#8217;s favor and not sufficiently covered by insurance, could have a material adverse effect on it. 
The Company has been and is, from time to time, involved in various litigation matters and is subject to government inquiries and investigations. These matters may include, among other things, contract disputes, personal injury claims, environmental claims or proceedings, asbestos and other toxic tort claims, employment matters, governmental claims for taxes or duties, and other disputes that arise in the ordinary course of the Company&#8217;s business. The Company believes it has sufficient insurance coverage for the majority, though not all, of these cases. 
Although the Company intends to defend these matters vigorously, it cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any such matter, and the ultimate outcome of these matters or the potential costs to resolve them could involve or result in significant expenditures or losses by the Company, or result in significant changes to OSG&#8217;s rules and practices in dealing with its customers, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s future operating results. Insurance may not be applicable or sufficient in all cases. Because litigation is inherently uncertain, the Company&#8217;s estimates for contingent liabilities may be insufficient to cover the actual liabilities from such claims, resulting in a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See Item 3, &#8220;Legal Proceedings,&#8221; and Note 18, &#8220;Contingencies,&#8221; to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statement and Supplementary Data.&#8221; 
Maritime claimants could arrest OSG&#8217;s vessels, which could interrupt cash flows. 
Crew members, suppliers of goods and services to a vessel, shippers of cargo and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against that vessel for unsatisfied debts, claims or damages. In many jurisdictions, a maritime lien holder may enforce its lien by arresting a vessel through foreclosure proceedings. The arrest or attachment of one or more of the Company&#8217;s vessels could interrupt OSG&#8217;s cash flow and require it to pay a significant amount of money to have the arrest lifted. Claimants could try to assert &#8220;sister ship&#8221; liability against one vessel in the Company&#8217;s fleet for claims relating to another vessel in its fleet which, if successful, could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Transfers or issuances of the Company&#8217;s equity may impair or reduce the Company&#8217;s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes in the future. 
Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an &#8220;ownership change&#8221; to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change. An &#8220;ownership change&#8221; is generally defined as any change in ownership of more than 50% of a corporation&#8217;s stock over a rolling three-year period by stockholders that own (directly or indirectly) 5% or more of the stock of a corporation or arising from a new issuance of stock by a corporation. If an ownership change occurs, Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the use of pre-ownership change NOLs, credits and certain other tax attributes to offset taxable income earned after the ownership change. The annual limitation is equal to the product of the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate and the value of the company&#8217;s stock immediately before the ownership change. This annual limitation may be adjusted to reflect any unused annual limitation for prior years and certain recognized built-in gains and losses for the year. In addition, Section 383 generally limits the amount of tax liability in any post-ownership change year that can be reduced by pre-ownership change tax credit carryforwards. If the Company were to undergo an &#8220;ownership change,&#8221; it could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Risks Related to the Common Stock and Warrants 
The market price of the Company&#8217;s securities fluctuates significantly . 
The market price of the Company&#8217;s securities fluctuates substantially. You may not be able to resell your Class A common stock or Class A warrants at or above the price you paid for such securities due to a number of factors, some of which are beyond the Company&#8217;s control, including the occurrence of the risks described herein. The falling price of the Company&#8217;s equity securities may expose the Company to securities class action litigation, which could result in substantial cost and the diversion of management&#8217;s attention and resources. 
The ability to sell warrants may be limited and the exercise of outstanding warrants may result in substantial dilution to the Company&#8217;s stockholders. 
The Company&#8217;s Class A warrants are currently traded as &#8220;restricted securities&#8221; in the over-the-counter market and in privately negotiated transactions among individual holders pursuant to exemptions from the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Transactions are reported as taking place only sporadically. The liquidity of any market that may develop for the Class A warrants, the ability to sell the Class A warrants and the price at which such securities would sell are all uncertain. 
The Company has outstanding Class A warrants with an exercise price of $0.01 per share exercisable into shares of Class A common stock. If exercised, the shares of Class A common stock underlying these warrants would represent approximately 4% of the Company&#8217;s outstanding Class A common stock. Accordingly, any such exercise may result in substantial dilution to the Company&#8217;s stockholders. 
The Company&#8217;s common stock is subject to restrictions on foreign ownership, which could have a negative impact on the transferability of the Company&#8217;s common stock, its liquidity and market value, and on a change of control of the Company. 
The Company&#8217;s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws authorize its Board of Directors to establish certain rules, policies and procedures, including procedures with respect to transfer of shares, to assist in monitoring and maintaining compliance with the Jones Act ownership restrictions. In order to provide a reasonable margin for compliance with the Jones Act at least 77% (the &#8220;Minimum Percentage&#8221;) of the outstanding shares of each class of capital stock of the Company must be owned by U.S. citizens. To assist the Company in complying with the Jones Act citizenship requirements, the Company participates in the Depository Trust Company&#8217;s (&#8220;DTC&#8221;) Seg&#8211;100 program. Under this system, shares of our common stock beneficially owned by non&#8211;U.S. citizens through DTC must be deposited in a segregated account known as Seg&#8211;100. 
Any purported transfer by a foreign holder of equity interests in the Company that cause the percentage of outstanding shares of a class of capital stock of the Company to fall below the Minimum Percentage will be rendered ineffective to transfer the equity interests or any voting, dividend or other rights associated with such interest in accordance with the rights afforded in the Jones Act and contained in the Company&#8217;s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws. 
The percentage of U.S. citizenship ownership of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common stock fluctuates based on daily trading, and at times in the past, has declined to the Minimum Percentage. At and during such time that the Minimum Percentage is reached, the Company will not issue any further shares of such class of common stock or approve transfers of such class of common stock to non-U.S. citizens. If a foreign owner&#8217;s acquisition causes total foreign ownership of our common stock to exceed the limit set forth in our Citizenship Policies, currently 23%, DTC will not permit additional shares to be deposited in the Company&#8217;s Seg&#8211;100 account. This is an additional risk that foreign owners of our common stock bear. 
The existence and enforcement of these ownership restrictions could have an adverse impact on the liquidity or market value of the Company&#8217;s equity securities. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, the ownership restrictions could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of the Company. 
The Company&#8217;s outstanding warrants are not subject to the above ownership restrictions, but the warrants include provisions limiting the right of non-U.S. citizens to exercise warrants if the shares of common stock that would be issued upon exercise would cause the percentage of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common stock held by U.S. citizens to decline below the Minimum Percentage. 
OSG is a holding company and depends on the ability of its subsidiaries to distribute funds to it in order to satisfy its financial obligations or pay dividends. 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. is a holding company and its subsidiaries conduct all of its operations and own all of its operating assets. It has no significant assets other than the equity interests in its subsidiaries. As a result, its ability to satisfy its financial obligations or pay dividends is dependent on the ability of its subsidiaries to distribute funds to it. In addition, the terms of the term loan, due 2023, term loans, due 2024, and term loan, due 2026, restrict the ability of OBS and its subsidiaries to distribute funds to Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
Some provisions of Delaware law and the Company&#8217;s governing documents could influence its ability to effect a change of control. 
Certain provisions of Delaware law and contained in the Company&#8217;s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of the Company. In addition, these provisions could make it more difficult to bring about a change in the composition of the Company&#8217;s board of directors. For example, the Company&#8217;s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws: 
Separately, the Company has elected to opt out of Section 203 (&#8220;Section 203&#8221;) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the &#8220;DGCL&#8221;), which restricts certain business combinations between a Delaware corporation and an &#8220;interested stockholder.&#8221; Accordingly, the Company will be able to enter into such transactions with its principal stockholders without complying with the requirements of Section 203. The election to opt out of Section 203 could deprive certain stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of the Company, particularly if it enters into a transaction with an &#8220;interested stockholder.&#8221; 
Securities analysts may not initiate coverage to cover the Company&#8217;s securities, and this may have a negative impact on their market price. 
The trading market for the Company&#8217;s securities will depend in part on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about the Company and its business. The Company does not have any control over securities analysts, and they may not initiate coverage or continue to cover the Company&#8217;s securities. If securities analysts do not cover the Company&#8217;s securities, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect their market price. If the Company is covered by securities analysts, and the Company&#8217;s securities are the subject of an unfavorable report, the Company&#8217;s securities prices would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover the Company or fails to publish regular reports on the Company, the Company could lose visibility in the financial markets, which may cause the price or trading volume of the Company&#8217;s securities to decline.

Risks Related to Our Industry 
The highly cyclical nature of supply and demand in the industry may lead to volatile changes in charter rates and vessel values, which could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s earnings, liquidity and available cash. 
The marine transportation industry is both cyclical and volatile in terms of charter rates and profitability. Fluctuations in charter rates and vessel values result from changes in supply and demand both for tanker capacity and for oil and oil products. Factors affecting these changes in supply and demand are generally outside of the Company&#8217;s control. The nature, timing and degree of changes in industry conditions are unpredictable and could adversely affect the values of the Company&#8217;s vessels or result in significant fluctuations in the amount of charter revenues the Company earns, which could result in significant volatility in OSG&#8217;s quarterly results and cash flows. Factors influencing the demand for tanker capacity include: 
supply and demand for, and availability of, energy resources such as oil, oil products and natural gas, which affect customers&#8217; need for vessel capacity; 
global and regional economic and political conditions, including armed conflicts, terrorist activities and strikes, that among other things could impact the supply of oil, as well as trading patterns and the demand for various vessel types; 
regional availability of refining capacity and inventories; 
changes in the production levels of crude oil (including in particular production by OPEC, the United States and other key producers); 
changes in seaborne and other transportation patterns, including changes in the distances that cargoes are transported, changes in the price of crude oil and changes to the West Texas Intermediate and Brent Crude Oil pricing benchmarks; 
environmental and other legal and regulatory developments and concerns; 
construction or expansion of new or existing pipelines or railways; 
weather and natural disasters; 
competition from alternative sources of energy; and 
international sanctions, embargoes, import and export restrictions or nationalizations and wars. 
Many of the factors that influence the demand for tanker capacity will also, in the longer term, effectively influence the supply of tanker capacity, since decisions to build new capacity, invest in capital repairs, or to retain in service older capacity are influenced by the general state of the marine transportation industry from time to time. Factors influencing the supply of vessel capacity include: 
the number of newbuilding deliveries; 
the conversion of vessels from transporting oil and oil products to carrying dry bulk cargo or vice versa; 
the number of vessels that are removed from service, whether via scrapping or conversion to storage or other means; 
availability and pricing of other energy sources such as natural gas for which tankers can be used or to which construction capacity may be dedicated; 
port or canal congestion; and 
environmental and maritime regulations. 
The market value of vessels fluctuates significantly, which could adversely affect OSG&#8217;s liquidity or otherwise adversely affect its financial condition. 
Jones Act and U.S. Flag vessel market values have, on average, generally declined over the past several years; however the market value of Jones Act vessels has fluctuated over time and is based upon various factors, including: 
age of the vessel; 
general economic and market conditions affecting the tanker industry, including the availability of vessel financing; 
number of vessels in the Jones Act fleet; 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
types and sizes of vessels available; 
changes in trading patterns affecting demand for particular sizes and types of vessels; 
cost of newbuildings; 
prevailing level of charter rates; 
competition from other shipping companies and from other modes of transportation; and 
technological advances in vessel design and propulsion. 
The fluctuating market values of the vessels can impact the Company&#8217;s liquidity regardless of whether the Company sells the vessels or continues to hold the vessels. For example, if OSG sells a vessel at a sale price that is less than the vessel&#8217;s carrying amount on the Company&#8217;s financial statements, OSG will incur a loss on the sale and a reduction in earnings and surplus. On the other hand, declining values of the Company&#8217;s vessels could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s liquidity by limiting its ability to raise cash by refinancing vessels. 
Even if the Company does not need immediate liquidity from the sale or refinancing of vessels, the Company may experience significant impairment charges upon a decline in vessel value. The Company evaluates events and changes in circumstances that have occurred to determine whether they indicate that the carrying amount of the vessels might not be recoverable. This review for potential impairment indicators and projection of future cash flows related to the vessels is complex and requires the Company to make various estimates, including future freight rates, the markets in which the vessels are expected to operate, earnings from the vessels, market appraisals and discount rates, all of which have historically been volatile. The Company evaluates the recoverable amount of a vessel as the sum of its undiscounted estimated future cash flows. If the recoverable amount is less than the vessel&#8217;s carrying amount, the vessel&#8217;s carrying amount is then compared to its estimated fair value, which is determined using vessel appraisals or discounted estimated future cash flows. If the vessel&#8217;s carrying amount is less than its fair value, it is deemed impaired. The carrying values of the Company&#8217;s vessels may differ significantly from their fair market value. Any charges relating to such impairments could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. 
An increase in the supply of Jones Act vessels without a commensurate increase in demand for such vessels could cause charter rates to decline, which could adversely affect OSG&#8217;s revenues, profitability and cash flows, as well as the value of its vessels. 
The marine transportation industry has historically been highly cyclical, as the profitability and asset values of companies in the industry have fluctuated based on changes in the supply of and demand for vessels. If the number of new ships of a particular class delivered exceeds the number of vessels of that class being scrapped, available capacity in that class will increase. Given the smaller number of tankers operating in the U.S. domestic market, the impact of even a limited increase in capacity supply may negatively affect the market and may have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s revenues, profitability and cash flows. 
OSG conducts certain of its operations internationally, which subjects the Company to changing economic, political and governmental conditions abroad that may adversely affect its business. 
The Company conducts certain of its operations internationally, and its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected by changing economic, political and government conditions in the countries and regions where its vessels are employed. 
OSG must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, anti-money laundering laws; and anti-competition regulations. Moreover, the shipping industry is generally considered to present elevated risks in these areas. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on the Company&#8217;s business operations and on the Company&#8217;s ability to transport cargo to one or more countries, and could also materially affect the Company&#8217;s brand, ability to attract and retain employees, international operations, business and operating results. Although OSG has policies and procedures designed to achieve compliance with these laws and regulations, OSG cannot be certain that its employees, contractors, joint venture partners or agents will not violate these policies and procedures. OSG&#8217;s operations may also subject its employees and agents to extortion attempts. 
Changes in fuel prices may adversely affect profits. 
Fuel is a significant, if not the largest, expense in the Company&#8217;s shipping operations when vessels are under voyage charter. Accordingly, an increase in the price of fuel may adversely affect the Company&#8217;s profitability if these increases cannot be passed onto customers. The price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside the Company&#8217;s control, including geopolitical developments; supply and demand for oil and gas; actions by OPEC, and other oil and gas 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
producers; war and unrest in oil producing countries and regions; regional production patterns; and environmental concerns. Fuel may become much more expensive in the future, which could reduce the profitability and competitiveness of the Company&#8217;s business compared to other forms of transportation. 
Shipping is a business with inherent risks, and OSG&#8217;s insurance may not be adequate to cover its losses. 
OSG&#8217;s vessels and their cargoes are at risk of being damaged or lost because of events including, but not limited to: 
marine disasters; 
bad weather; 
mechanical failures; 
human error; 
war, terrorism and piracy; 
grounding, fire, explosions and collisions; 
business interruptions due to labor strikes, port closings and boycotts and 
other unforeseen circumstances or events. 
These hazards may result in death or injury to persons; loss of revenues or property; environmental damage; higher insurance rates; damage to OSG&#8217;s existing customer relationships and industry reputation; and market disruptions, and delay or rerouting, all of which may also subject OSG to litigation. In addition, the operation of tankers has unique operational risks associated with the transportation of oil. An oil spill may cause significant environmental damage and the associated costs could exceed the insurance coverage available to the Company. Compared to other types of vessels, tankers are also exposed to a higher risk of damage and loss by fire, whether ignited by a terrorist attack, collision, or other cause, due to the high flammability and high volume of the oil transported in tankers. Any of these events could result in loss of revenues, decreased cash flows and increased costs. 
While the Company carries insurance to protect against certain of these risks, risks may arise against which the Company is not adequately insured. For example, a catastrophic spill could exceed OSG&#8217;s $1 billion per vessel insurance coverage and have a material adverse effect on its operations. In addition, OSG may not be able to procure adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates in the future, and any particular claim may not be paid by its insurers. In the past, new and stricter environmental regulations have led to higher costs for insurance covering environmental damage or pollution, and new regulations could lead to similar increases or even make this type of insurance unavailable. 
Furthermore, even if insurance coverage is adequate to cover the Company&#8217;s liabilities arising from the loss of a vessel, OSG may not be able to timely obtain a replacement ship. 
OSG may also be subject to calls, or premiums, in amounts based not only on its own claim records but also the claim records of all other members of the protection and indemnity associations through which OSG obtains insurance coverage for tort liability. OSG&#8217;s payment of these calls could result in significant expenses which would reduce its profits and cash flows or cause losses. 
Constraints on capital availability have adversely affected the tanker industry and OSG&#8217;s business. 
Constraints on capital may adversely affect the financial condition of certain of the Company&#8217;s customers, financial lenders and suppliers. Entities that suffer a material adverse impact on their financial condition may be unable or unwilling to comply with their contractual commitments to OSG including the refusal or inability of customers to pay charter hire to OSG or the inability or unwillingness of financial lenders to honor their commitments to lend funds. While OSG seeks to monitor the financial condition of its customers, financial lenders and suppliers, the availability and accuracy of information about the financial condition of such entities and the actions that OSG may take to reduce possible losses resulting from the failure of such entities to comply with their contractual obligations may be limited. Any such failure could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s revenues, profitability and cash flows. In addition, adverse financial conditions may inhibit these entities from entering into new commitments with OSG, which could also have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s revenues, profitability and cash flows. 
The Company also faces other potential constraints on capital relating to counterparty credit risk and constraints on OSG&#8217;s ability to borrow funds. The Company is subject to credit risks with respect to its counterparties on contracts and any failure by these counterparties to meet their obligations could cause the Company to suffer losses on such contracts, decreasing revenues and earnings&#8221; and &#8220; Risks Related to Our Company - OSG has incurred significant indebtedness which could affect its ability to finance its operations, pursue desirable business opportunities and successfully run its business in the future, all of which could affect OSG&#8217;s ability to fulfill its obligations under that indebtedness.&#8221; 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
Public health threats could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s operations and financial results. 
Public health threats and other highly communicable diseases, outbreaks of which have already occurred in various parts of the world near where OSG operates, could adversely impact the Company&#8217;s operations, the operations of the Company&#8217;s customers and the global economy, including the worldwide demand for crude oil and the level of demand for OSG&#8217;s services. Any quarantine of personnel, restrictions on travel to or from countries in which OSG operates, or inability to access certain areas could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s operations. Travel restrictions, operational problems or large-scale social unrest in any part of the world in which OSG operates, or any reduction in the demand for tanker services caused by public health threats in the future, may impact OSG&#8217;s operations and adversely affect the Company&#8217;s financial results. 
Acts of piracy on ocean-going vessels could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business. 
Although the Company&#8217;s fleet operates mainly in U.S. waters, there are occasions when a vessel may be in an area where pirate attacks are a concern. The frequency of pirate attacks on seagoing vessels remains high, particularly in the western part of the Indian Ocean, off the west coast of Africa and in the South China Sea. If piracy attacks result in regions in which the Company&#8217;s vessels are deployed being characterized by insurers as &#8220;war risk&#8221; zones, as the Gulf of Aden has been, or Joint War Committee &#8220;war and strikes&#8221; listed areas, premiums payable for insurance coverage could increase significantly, and such insurance coverage may become difficult to obtain. Crew costs could also increase in such circumstances due to risks of piracy attacks. 
In addition, while OSG believes the charterer remains liable for charter payments when a vessel is seized by pirates, the charterer may dispute this and withhold charter hire until the vessel is released. A charterer may also claim that a vessel seized by pirates was not &#8220;on-hire&#8221; for a certain number of days and it is therefore entitled to cancel the charter party, a claim the Company would dispute. The Company may not be adequately insured to cover losses from these incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, hijacking as a result of an act of piracy against the Company&#8217;s vessels, or an increase in the cost (or unavailability) of insurance for those vessels, could have a material adverse impact on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Such attacks may also impact the Company&#8217;s customers, which could impair their ability to make payments to the Company under its charters. 
Terrorist attacks and international hostilities and instability can affect the tanker industry, which could adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business. 
Terrorist attacks, the outbreak of war, or the existence of international hostilities could damage the world economy, adversely affect the availability of and demand for crude oil and petroleum products and adversely affect both the Company&#8217;s ability to charter its vessels and the charter rates payable under any such charters. In addition, OSG operates in a sector of the economy that is likely to be adversely impacted by the effects of political instability, terrorist or other attacks, war or international hostilities. In the past, political instability has also resulted in attacks on vessels, mining of waterways and other efforts to disrupt international shipping, particularly in the Arabian Gulf region. These factors could also increase the costs to the Company of conducting its business, particularly crew, insurance and security costs, and prevent or restrict the Company from obtaining insurance coverage, all of which could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Risks Related to Our Company 
As a result of the spin-off of INSW on November 30, 2016, OSG&#8217;s historical financial information may not be a reliable indicator of OSG&#8217;s future financial results and the spin-off may adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business. 
In accordance with Accounting Standards Update 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, &#32;the assets and liabilities and results of operations of INSW are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Accordingly, all references made to financial data in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are to OSG&#8217;s continuing operations, unless specifically noted. Accordingly, the historical financial information included in this Annual Report does not necessarily reflect the financial condition, operating performance or cash flows that OSG would have achieved without INSW as a wholly owned subsidiary during the periods presented or those that OSG will achieve in the future, including as a result of the following factors: 
Prior to the spin-off, OSG or one of its affiliates performed various corporate functions for INSW, such as treasury, accounting, auditing, legal, investor relations and finance. OSG&#8217;s historical results reflect allocations of corporate expenses 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
to INSW for such functions. In connection with the spin-off, OSG may incur additional expenses for such services after the spin-off. 
As a result of the spin-off, the cost of capital of OSG&#8217;s business may be higher than its cost of capital prior to the spin-off. 
OSG may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the spin-off or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. The anticipated benefits may not be achieved for a variety of reasons, including among others: 
The separation of our business from INSW and provision of services to INSW under the Transition Services Agreement require significant amounts of management&#8217;s time and effort in developing standalone organizations which may divert management&#8217;s attention from operating and growing OSG&#8217;s business; 
Following the spin-off, OSG may be more vulnerable to the risk of takeover by third parties; 
Following the spin-off, OSG may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than if INSW was still a part of OSG; and 
Following the spin-off, OSG&#8217;s business is less diversified and has a more concentrated exposure to U.S specific risks such as the Jones Act market than prior to the spin-off. 
If OSG fails to achieve some or all of the benefits to result from the spin-off, or if such benefits are delayed, it could have an adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s competitive position, financial condition, operating results or cash flows. 
OSG has incurred significant indebtedness which could affect its ability to finance its operations, pursue desirable business opportunities and successfully run its business in the future, all of which could affect OSG&#8217;s ability to fulfill its obligations under that indebtedness. 
As of December 31, 2018, OSG had $345.5 million of outstanding indebtedness. OSG&#8217;s substantial indebtedness and interest expense could have important consequences, including: 
limiting OSG&#8217;s ability to use a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations in other areas of its business, including for working capital, capital expenditures and other general business activities, because OSG must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to service its debt; 
to the extent OSG&#8217;s future cash flows are insufficient, requiring the Company to seek to incur additional indebtedness in order to make planned capital expenditures and other expenses or investments; 
limiting OSG&#8217;s ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and other expenses or investments planned by the Company; 
limiting the Company&#8217;s flexibility and ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures and adverse changes in government regulation, and OSG&#8217;s business and industry; 
limiting OSG&#8217;s ability to satisfy its obligations under its indebtedness; 
increasing OSG&#8217;s vulnerability to a downturn in its business and to adverse economic and industry conditions generally; 
placing OSG at a competitive disadvantage as compared to its less-leveraged competitors; 
limiting the Company&#8217;s ability, or increasing the costs, to refinance indebtedness; and 
limiting the Company&#8217;s ability to enter into hedging transactions by reducing the number of counterparties with whom OSG can enter into such transactions as well as the volume of those transactions. 
OSG&#8217;s ability to continue to fund its obligations and to reduce debt may be affected by general economic, financial market, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, among other things. An inability to fund the Company&#8217;s debt requirements or reduce debt could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Additionally, the actual or perceived credit quality of the Company&#8217;s charterers (as well as any defaults by them) could materially affect the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain the additional capital resources that it will require to purchase additional vessels, including OSG's two new MR product tankers that are expected to be delivered in September 2019, or significantly increase the costs of obtaining such capital. The Company&#8217;s inability to obtain additional financing at a higher-than-anticipated cost, or at all, could materially affect the Company&#8217;s results of operations and its ability to implement its business strategy. 
The Company may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of its indebtedness, and could in the future breach covenants in its credit facilities and term loans. 
The Company&#8217;s earnings, cash flow and the market value of its vessels vary significantly over time due to the cyclical nature of the tanker industry, as well as general economic and market conditions affecting the industry. As a result, the amount of debt that OSG can manage in some periods may not be appropriate in other periods and its ability to meet the financial covenants to 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
which it is subject or may be subject in the future may vary. Additionally, future cash flow may be insufficient to meet the Company&#8217;s debt obligations and commitments, including the remaining payments due upon delivery of OSG's two new MR product tankers that are expected to be delivered in September 2019. Any insufficiency could negatively impact OSG&#8217;s business. 
The term loan, due 2023, term loan, due 2026, and the ABL Facility contain certain restrictions relating to new borrowings and, the movement of funds between OBS and OSG, as set forth in the loan agreement. Furthermore, drawdowns under the OBS ABL Facility are limited based upon the available borrowing base, as defined in that loan agreement and, if availability falls below a certain amount for a specified period of time, the administrative agent could exercise cash dominion rights permitting it to invoke control rights over certain of our accounts. While the Company was in compliance with these requirements as of December 31, 2018, a decrease in vessel values could require the Company to make mandatory payments on its existing term loans, decrease the availability of the revolving credit facility, or cause the Company to breach certain covenants in future financing agreements that the Company may enter into from time to time. If the Company is unable to make the mandatory prepayments or breaches such covenants and is unable to remedy the relevant breach or obtain a waiver, the Company&#8217;s lenders could accelerate its debt and foreclose on the Company&#8217;s owned vessels. 
A range of economic, competitive, financial, business, industry and other factors will affect future financial performance, and, accordingly, the Company&#8217;s ability to generate cash flow from operations and to pay debt. Many of these factors, such as charter rates, economic and financial conditions in the tanker industry and the economy, the creditworthiness of our customers, or competitive initiatives of competitors, are beyond the Company&#8217;s control. If OSG does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy its debt obligations, it may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as: 
refinancing or restructuring its debt; 
selling tankers or other assets; 
reducing or delaying investments and capital expenditures; or 
seeking to raise additional capital. 
Undertaking alternative financing plans, if necessary, might not allow OSG to meet its debt obligations. The Company&#8217;s ability to restructure or refinance its debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets, its access to such markets and its financial condition at that time. The 8.125% unsecured Notes had a maturity date of March 30, 2018. To remain in compliance with the OBS ABL Facility, the Company paid off the outstanding balance on its 8.125% unsecured Notes in December 2017. The OBS Term Loan had a maturity date of August 5, 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company refinanced $325.0 million and paid off the remaining balance of the OBS Term Loan using $27.5 million of proceeds from the term loan, due 2026, and cash on hand. Any future refinancing of debt could be at higher interest rates and might require the Company to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict OSG&#8217;s business operations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict OSG from adopting certain alternatives. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit OSG to meet its scheduled debt service obligations. The Company&#8217;s inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its debt obligations, to meet the covenants of its credit agreements and term loans and/or to obtain alternative financing in such circumstances, could materially and adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Changes in demand in specialized markets in which the Company currently operates or changes in governmental support may lead the Company to redeploy certain vessels to other markets or put its ability to participate in specialized markets at risk. 
The Company deploys its vessels in several niche markets, including lightering in the Delaware Bay. The Company conducts those lightering operations with two ATBs which were purpose built for these operations. If there is lower demand for these vessels in the Delaware Bay lightering market, the Company may have to redeploy one or both of these two ATBs in other markets. If that were to occur, the Company may not be able to compete profitably in the new markets, and the ATBs may not be able to be redeployed to new markets without substantial modification. In addition, the Company would be required to pay daily liquidated damages to MarAd if those vessels were deployed in the contiguous coastwise trades. 
The Company has two vessels participating in the MSP which derive a substantial percentage of revenues earned from transporting cargoes reserved for U.S. Flag vessels under MarAd&#8217;s Cargo Preference program. The Cargo Preference program works to promote and facilitate a U.S. maritime transportation system and oversees the administration of and compliance with U.S. cargo preference laws and regulations. Those laws require shippers to give U.S.-flag vessels a preference to transport any government-impelled ocean borne cargoes. Government-impelled cargo is cargo that is moving either as a direct result of Federal government involvement, indirectly through financial sponsorship of a Federal program, or in connection with a guarantee provided by the Federal government. 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
Among the currently available government&#8211;impelled cargoes is a contract the Company has with the government of Israel (""GOI"") to deliver fuel through December 31, 2020, which the GOI funds with grants from the U.S. government. The Company must seek other government&#8211;impelled cargoes to supplement the GOI business, however, there is no assurance the Company will be able to secure such cargoes. In addition, if the Company is unable to retain the GOI business, or is unable to obtain significant other charters for these vessels, the Company may no longer be able to participate in the MSP and the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected. 
The Company operates three Jones Act MR Shuttle Tankers, two of which are currently operating as shuttle tankers serving offshore oil installations in the Gulf of Mexico. Modifications made to enable these tankers to perform the specialized service of a shuttle tanker required the Company to incur substantial capital costs, which in turn allow the Company to earn a premium to market rates earned by conventional Jones Act tankers. While shuttle tankers can serve as conventional tankers without further modification, future reduction in the demand for specialized shuttle tanker services could limit the Company&#8217;s ability to earn such premiums, which could adversely affect the financial results of the Company as compared to historical results. 
In the highly competitive Jones Act market, OSG may not be able to compete effectively for charters. 
The Company&#8217;s vessels are employed in a highly competitive market. Competition arises from other vessel owners, including major oil companies, which may have substantially greater resources than OSG does. Competition for the transportation of crude oil and other petroleum products depends on price; location; size, age and condition of vessel; and the acceptability of the vessel operator to the charterer. To the extent OSG enters into new geographic regions or provides new services, it may not be able to compete profitably. New markets may involve competitive factors that differ from those of the Company&#8217;s current markets, and the competitors in those markets may have greater financial strength and capital resources than OSG does. 
OSG may not be able to renew Time Charters when they expire or enter into new Time Charters. 
OSG&#8217;s ability to renew expiring contracts or obtain new charters will depend on the prevailing market conditions at the time of renewal. As of December 31, 2018, OSG employed 15 vessels on Time Charters, with 12 of those expiring in 2019, two expiring in 2020 and one expiring in 2025. The Company&#8217;s existing Time Charters may not be renewed at comparable rates or if renewed or entered into, those new contracts may be at less favorable rates. In addition, there may be a gap in employment of vessels between current charters and subsequent charters. If at a time when OSG is seeking to arrange new charters for its vessels, market participants expect that less capacity will be necessary in the future (for example, if it is expected that oil and natural gas prices will decrease in the future, which could suggest that future oil and gas production levels will decline from then-current levels), OSG may not be able to obtain charters at attractive rates or at all. If, upon expiration of the existing Time Charter, OSG is unable to obtain Time Charters or Voyage Charters at desirable rates, the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected. 
OSG may not realize the benefits it expects from future acquisitions or other strategic transactions it may make. 
OSG&#8217;s business strategy includes ongoing efforts to engage in material acquisitions of assets or ownership interests in entities in the tanker industry and of individual tankers. The Company has recently entered into a 10 year bareboat lease of a 20 year old product tanker which will be in the market in the second quarter of 2019. The Company is also constructing two new 50,000 deadweight tons chemical tankers and two new 204,000 bbl barges which will come into the market in 2020. The success of OSG&#8217;s acquisitions will depend upon a number of factors, some of which may not be within its control. These factors include OSG&#8217;s ability to: 
identify suitable tankers and/or shipping companies for acquisitions at attractive prices, which may not be possible if asset prices rise too quickly; 
obtain financing; 
identify businesses engaged in managing, operating or owning tankers for acquisitions or joint ventures; 
integrate any acquired tankers or businesses successfully with the OSG&#8217;s then-existing operations; and 
enhance OSG&#8217;s customer base. 
OSG intends to finance any future acquisitions by using available cash from operations, entering into leases and through incurrence of debt or bridge financing, either of which may increase its leverage ratios, or by issuing equity, which may have a dilutive impact on its existing stockholders. At any given time, OSG may be engaged in a number of discussions that may result in one or more acquisitions, some of which may be material to OSG as a whole. These opportunities require confidentiality and may involve negotiations that require quick responses by OSG. Although there can be no certainty that any of these discussions 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
will result in definitive agreements or the completion of any transactions, the announcement of any such transaction may lead to increased volatility in the trading price of OSG&#8217;s securities. 
Acquisitions and other transactions can also involve a number of special risks and challenges, including: 
diversion of management time and attention from the Company&#8217;s existing business and other business opportunities; 
delays in closing or the inability to close an acquisition for any reason, including third-party consents or approvals; 
any unanticipated negative impact on the Company of disclosed or undisclosed matters relating to any vessels or operations acquired; and 
assumption of debt or other liabilities of the acquired business, including litigation related to the acquired business. 
The success of acquisitions or strategic investments depends on the effective integration of newly acquired businesses or assets into OSG&#8217;s current operations. Such integration is subject to risks and uncertainties, including realization of anticipated synergies and cost savings, the ability to retain and attract personnel and customers, the diversion of management&#8217;s attention from other business concerns, risk of non-compliance with internal controls over financial reporting for an acquired company, in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of the acquired company or asset. Further, if a portion of the purchase price of a business is attributable to goodwill and if the acquired business does not perform up to expectations at the time of the acquisition some or all of the goodwill may be written off, adversely affecting OSG&#8217;s earnings. 
The Company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from a limited number of customers, and the loss of, or reduction in business by, any of these customers could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. 
The Company&#8217;s largest customers account for a significant portion of its revenues. The Company&#8217;s top two customers comprised approximately 23% of the Company&#8217;s revenues during 2018. The loss of, or reduction in business by, any of these customers could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition and results of operations. 
Certain potential customers will not use vessels older than a specified age, even if the vessels have been subsequently rebuilt. 
All of the Company&#8217;s existing ATBs were originally constructed more than 25 years ago with the exception of the OSG Vision/OSG 350, OSG Horizon/OSG 351, which were built between 2010 and 2011, respectively. The OSG Endurance and OSG Courageous tugs, which were built in 2011, will be paired with the Company's new barges expected to be delivered in the second quarter of 2020 and fourth quarter of 2020. While all of these rebuilt tug-barge units were rebuilt and double-hulled since 1998 and are &#8220;in-class,&#8221; meaning the vessel has been certified by a Classification Society as being built and maintained in accordance with the rules of that Classification Society and complies with the applicable rules and regulations of the vessel&#8217;s country of registry and applicable international conventions, some potential customers have stated that they will not charter vessels that are more than 20 years old, even if they have been rebuilt. Other customers may not continue to view rebuilt vessels as suitable. With an increase in the supply of newer vessels, customers may become more selective. If more customers differentiate rebuilt vessels, time charter rates for the Company&#8217;s rebuilt ATBs will likely be adversely affected. 
The Company&#8217;s significant operating leases could be replaced on less favorable terms or may not be replaced. 
The Company&#8217;s operating fleet includes ten vessels that have been chartered-in under operating leases. The significant operating leases of the Company in its various businesses expire at various points in the future and may not be replaced at all or on as favorable terms, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s future financial position, results of operations and cash flow. 
The Company is subject to credit risks with respect to its counterparties on contracts, and any failure by those counterparties to meet their obligations could cause the Company to suffer losses on such contracts, decreasing revenues and earnings. 
The Company has entered into, and in the future will enter into, various contracts, including charter agreements and other agreements associated with the operation of its vessels. The Company charters its vessels to other parties, who pay the company a daily rate of hire. The Company also enters COAs and Voyage Charters. Historically, the Company has not experienced material problems collecting charter hire but the risk increases during economic downturns. Additionally, the Company enters into derivative contracts (interest rate swaps and caps) from time to time. As a result, the Company is subject to credit risks. The ability of each of the Company&#8217;s counterparties to perform its obligations under a contract with it will depend on a number of factors that are beyond the Company&#8217;s control and may include, among other things, general economic conditions; availability of debt or equity financing; the condition of the maritime and offshore industries; the overall financial 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
condition of the counterparty including the bankrupcy of the counterparty; charter rates received for specific types of vessels; and various expenses. Charterers are sensitive to the commodity markets and may be impacted by market forces affecting commodities such as oil. In addition, in depressed market conditions, the Company&#8217;s charterers and customers may no longer need a vessel that is currently under charter or contract or may be able to obtain a comparable vessel at lower rates. As a result, the Company&#8217;s customers may fail to pay charter hire or attempt to renegotiate charter rates. If the counterparties fail to meet their obligations, the Company could suffer losses on such contracts which would decrease revenues, cash flows and earnings. 
Operating costs and capital expenses will increase as the Company&#8217;s vessels age and may also increase due to unanticipated events relating to secondhand vessels and the consolidation of suppliers. 
In general, capital expenditures and other costs necessary for maintaining a vessel in good operating condition increase as the age of the vessel increases. As of December 31, 2018, the average age of the Company&#8217;s total owned and operated fleet was 10.2 years, which is based on the vessels&#8217; year of rebuild, where applicable. Cargo insurance rates are also expected to increase with the age of a vessel. Accordingly, it is likely that the operating costs of OSG&#8217;s currently operated vessels will increase. In addition, changes in governmental regulations and compliance with Classification Society standards may restrict the type of activities in which the vessels may engage and/or may require OSG to make additional expenditures for new equipment. Every commercial tanker must pass inspection by a Classification Society authorized by the vessel&#8217;s country of registry. The Classification Society certifies that a tanker is safe and seaworthy in accordance with the applicable rule and regulations of the country of registry of the tanker and the international conventions of which that country is a number. If a Classification Society requires the Company to add equipment, OSG may be required to incur substantial costs or take its vessels out of service. Market conditions may not justify such expenditures or permit OSG to operate its older vessels profitably even if those vessels remain operational. If a vessel in OSG&#8217;s fleet does not maintain its class and/or fails any survey, then it will be unemployable and unable to trade between ports, which would negatively impact the Company&#8217;s results of operation. 
Furthermore, recent mergers have reduced the number of available suppliers, resulting in fewer alternatives for sourcing key supplies. With respect to certain items, OSG is generally dependent upon the original equipment manufacturer for repair and replacement of the item or its spare parts. Supplier consolidation may result in a shortage of supplies and services, thereby increasing the cost of supplies or potentially inhibiting the ability of suppliers to deliver on time. These cost increases or delays could result in downtime, and delays in the repair and maintenance of the Company&#8217;s vessels and have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
The Company may face unexpected drydock costs for its vessels. 
Vessels must be drydocked periodically for inspection and maintenance, and in the event of accidents or other unforeseen damage. The cost of repairs and renewals required at each drydock are difficult to predict with certainty, can be substantial and the Company&#8217;s insurance may not cover these costs. Vessels in drydock will generally not generate any income. Large drydocking expenses could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the time when a vessel is out of service for maintenance is determined by a number of factors including regulatory deadlines, market conditions, shipyard availability and customer requirements. Large drydocking expenses and longer than anticipated off-hire time could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Technological innovation could reduce the Company&#8217;s charter income and the value of the Company&#8217;s vessels. 
The charter rates and the value and operational life of a vessel are determined by a number of factors including the vessel&#8217;s efficiency, operational flexibility and physical life. Efficiency includes speed, fuel economy and the ability to load and discharge cargo quickly. Flexibility includes the ability to enter harbors, utilize related docking facilities and pass through canals and straits. The length of a vessel&#8217;s physical life is related to its original design and construction, its maintenance and the impact of the stress of operations. Competition from more technologically advanced vessels could adversely affect the amount of charter payments the Company receives for its vessels once their initial charters expire and the resale value of the Company&#8217;s vessels could significantly decrease. As a result, the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. 
Interruption, failure or breach of OSG&#8217;s information technology and communications systems could impair its ability to operate and adversely affect its business. 
OSG is highly dependent on information technology systems. These dependencies include accounting, billing, disbursement, cargo booking and tracking, vessel scheduling and stowage, equipment tracking, customer service, banking, payroll and communication systems. Information technology and communication systems are subject to reliability issues, integration and compatibility concerns, and security-threatening intrusions. OSG may experience failures caused by the occurrence of a natural 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
disaster, computer hacking or viruses or other unanticipated problems at OSG&#8217;s facilities, aboard its vessels or at third-party locations. Any failure of OSG&#8217;s or third-party systems could result in interruptions in service, reductions in its revenue and profits, damage to its reputation or liability for the release of confidential information. 
We collect, store and transmit sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and that of our clients, and personally identifiable information of our clients and employees, using both our information technology systems and those of third party vendors. The secure storage, processing, maintenance, and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Our network, or those of our clients or third party vendors, could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, and other security problems. Many companies have increasingly reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage. Cybersecurity issues, such as security breaches and computer viruses, affecting our information technology systems or those of our third party vendors, could disrupt our business, result in the unintended disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs, and cause losses. 
We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. Security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent security breaches (including the inability of our third party vendors to prevent security breaches) could also cause existing clients to lose confidence in our systems and could adversely affect our reputation, cause losses to us or our clients, damage our brand, and increase our costs. 
Delays or disruptions in implementing new technological and management systems could impair the Company&#8217;s ability to operate and adversely affect its business. 
The Company is currently in the process of transitioning to a new software system for managing ship operations. In addition, from time to time the Company will implement or upgrade certain other technological resources utilized in running its business. Implementation of this new software system will have a significant impact on our business processes and information systems. The transition will require a significant investment in capital and personnel resources and the coordination of numerous software and system providers and internal business teams. The Company may experience difficulties as it manages these changes and transitions to the new system and upgrades its technological resources, including loss or corruption of data, delays, decreases in productivity as personnel implement and become familiar with new systems and processes, and unanticipated expenses. Additionally, the Company could be adversely affected if the new software system it is implementing for managing ship operations or other new or upgraded technological resource are defective, not installed properly, fail to perform as marketed or are not properly integrated into existing operations. In addition, the implementation of a new system may not result in improvements that outweigh the cost of implementation. System implementation failures or operational failures, including unauthorized access by third parties to our new software system (which could have the effects described in the preceding risk factor) and could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial position, and ability to operate in a complex industry. Moreover, difficulties in implementing the new software could disrupt the Company&#8217;s operations or divert management&#8217;s attention from key strategic initiatives. 
We could face significant liability if one or more multiemployer plans in which we participate is reported to have underfunded liabilities and we withdraw from participation in one or more multiemployer pension plans in which we participate. 
The Company is a party to collective-bargaining agreements that requires contributions to three jointly managed (Company and union) multiemployer pension plans covering seagoing personnel of U.S. Flag vessels. Our required contributions to these plans could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these plans, the inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability, low interest rates, lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. Certain of these multiemployer plans are currently underfunded. Significantly underfunded pension plans are required to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their under-funding. As a result, our required contributions to these plans may increase in the future. In addition, a termination of our voluntary withdrawal from or a mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from a underfunded multiemployer pension plan would require us to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of such multiemployer pension plan&#8217;s unfunded vested liabilities. See Note 17, &#8220;Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefit Plans,&#8221; to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 for additional information. Requirements to pay increased contributions or withdrawal liabilities could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and results of operations. 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
The Company may have difficulty attracting and retaining skilled employees and is dependent on unionized employees. 
OSG&#8217;s success depends to a significant extent upon the abilities and efforts of its key personnel. The loss of the services of key personnel or the Company&#8217;s inability to attract, motivate and retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition and operating results. 
As of December 31, 2018, OSG had approximately 1,061 employees, of which 812 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions. See Item 1, &#8220;Business - Employees.&#8221; OSG could be adversely affected by actions taken by employees of OSG or other companies in related industries (including third parties providing services to OSG) against efforts by management to control labor costs, restrain wage or benefits increases or modify work practices or the failure of OSG or other companies in its industry to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements. 
Effective internal controls are necessary for the Company to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. 
The Company maintains a system of internal controls to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The process of designing and implementing effective internal controls is a continuous effort that requires the Company to anticipate and react to changes in its business and the economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy its reporting obligations as a public company. 
Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase the Company&#8217;s operating costs and harm its business. Furthermore, investors&#8217; perceptions that the Company&#8217;s internal controls are inadequate or that the Company is unable to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis may harm its stock price. 
We may be adversely affected by changes in U.S. tax laws. 
During 2017, the U.S. Congress recently passed the Tax Cut &#38; Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;TCJA&#8221;) for which the Company has received a non-cash benefit. See Note 12, &#8220;Taxes,&#8221; for additional information. The Company is in an overall deferred tax liability position, however it has significant deferred tax assets consisting primarily of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards that are expected to be realized over an extended number of years. Although the reduction in the corporate income tax rate as of January 1, 2018 will reduce the amount of income taxes we would pay in the future, a reduction in the corporate income tax rate also results in a decrease in the value of our net operating loss carryforwards. The re-measurement of the net deferred tax liability resulted in an increase to our net income and total equity during 2017, as discussed further in Note 12, &#8220;Taxes.&#8221; The Company &#32; also currently benefits from the deduction of interest expense on its indebtedness, which is subject to limitations to deductibility under the TCJA starting this year. Any elimination or modification of that deduction would increase the Company&#8217;s cash income taxes payable, reducing our future cash available for operations and dividend payments. 
Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters 
The Company&#8217;s business would be adversely affected if it failed to comply with the Jones Act&#8217;s limitations on U.S. coastwise trade, or if these limitations were waived, modified or repealed, or if changes in international trade agreements were to occur. 
Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s operations are conducted in the U.S. coastwise trade and are governed by U.S. federal laws commonly known as the &#8220;Jones Act&#8221;. The Jones Act restricts waterborne transportation of goods between points in the United States to vessels meeting certain requirements, including ownership and control by &#8220;U.S. Citizens&#8221; as defined thereunder. The Company is responsible for monitoring the foreign ownership of its common stock and other interests to ensure compliance with the Jones Act. The Company could lose the privilege of owning and operating vessels in the Jones Act trade if non-U.S. Citizens were to own or control, in the aggregate, more than 25% of the equity interests in the Company. Such loss would have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business and results of operations. In addition, under certain circumstances failure to comply with the Jones Act may result in the Company being deemed to have violated other U.S. federal laws that prohibit a foreign transfer of U.S. documented vessels without government approval, resulting in severe penalties, including permanent loss of U.S. coastwise trading privileges or forfeiture of the vessels deemed transferred, and fines. 
Additionally, maritime transportation services are currently excluded from the General Agreement on Trade in Services (&#8220;GATS&#8221;) and are the subject of reservations by the United States in the North American Free Trade Agreement (&#8220;NAFTA&#8221;) and other international free trade agreements. If maritime transportation services were included in GATS, NAFTA or other

international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise repealed or altered, the transportation of maritime cargo between U.S. ports could be opened to international flag or foreign built vessels. Recently, particularly with regard to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Irma, interest groups have lobbied Congress, and legislation has been introduced, to repeal certain provisions of the Jones Act or to grant extensive waivers so as to facilitate international flag competition for trades and cargoes currently reserved for U.S. Flag vessels under the Jones Act. The Company expects that continued efforts will be made to modify, repeal, or waive the Jones Act. Because international vessels may have lower construction costs, wage rates and operating costs, this could significantly increase competition in the coastwise trade, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
The U.S. government could requisition the Company&#8217;s vessels during a period of war or emergency, which may negatively impact the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and available cash. 
The U.S. government could requisition one or more of the Company&#8217;s vessels for title or hire, typically occurring during a period of war or emergency. Requisition for title or hire occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and becomes the owner or the charterer at dictated charter rates. Two OSG vessels participate in the U.S. Maritime Security Program, which ensures that militarily useful U.S. Flag vessels are available to the U.S. Department of Defense in the event of war or national emergency. Under the program, OSG receives an annual fee, subject in each case to annual Congressional appropriations, in exchange for a guarantee that the ships will be made available to the U.S. government in the time of war or national emergency. The U.S. government requisition of one or more of the Company&#8217;s vessels may impact the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and available cash if the charter rates we receive from the government while on requisition are less than the charter rates that are being replaced, or if the government refuses to pay the requisition charter rate, in which case we would seek recovery through our insurance policies. 
Compliance with complex laws, regulations, and, in particular, environmental laws or regulations may adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business. 
The Company&#8217;s operations are affected by extensive and changing international, national and local environmental protection laws, regulations, treaties, conventions and standards. These requirements are designed to reduce the risk of oil spills and water pollution and to regulate air emissions, including emission of greenhouse gases. These requirements impose significant capital and operating costs on OSG, including those related to engine adjustments and ballast water treatment. 
Environmental laws and regulations also can affect the resale value or significantly reduce the useful lives of the Company&#8217;s vessels, require a reduction in carrying capacity, ship modifications or operational changes or restrictions (and related increased operating costs) or retirement of service, lead to decreased availability or higher cost of insurance coverage for environmental matters or result in the denial of access to, or detention in, certain jurisdictional waters or ports. Under local, national and foreign laws, as well as international treaties and conventions, OSG could incur material liabilities, including cleanup obligations, in the event that there is a release of petroleum or other hazardous substances from its vessels or otherwise in connection with its operations. OSG could be subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to the release of or exposure to hazardous materials associated with its current or historic operations. Violations of or liabilities under environmental requirements also can result in substantial penalties, fines and other sanctions, including in certain instances, seizure or detention of the Company&#8217;s vessels. 
OSG could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs, fines, penalties, third-party claims and natural resource damages, as the result of an oil spill or liabilities under environmental laws. The Company is subject to the oversight of several government agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Maritime Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation. OPA 90 affects all vessel owners shipping oil or hazardous material to, from or within the United States. OPA 90 allows for potentially unlimited liability without regard to fault for owners, operators and bareboat charterers of vessels for oil pollution in U.S. waters. Similarly, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, as amended, which has been adopted by most countries outside of the United States, imposes liability for oil pollution in international waters. OPA 90 expressly permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to hazardous materials and oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries. Coastal states in the United States have enacted pollution prevention liability and response laws, many providing for unlimited liability. 
In order to comply with laws and regulations, shipowners likely will incur substantial additional capital and/or operating expenditures to meet new regulatory requirements, to develop contingency arrangements for potential spills and to obtain insurance coverage. Key regulatory initiatives that are anticipated to require substantial additional capital and/or operating expenditures in the next several years include more stringent limits on the sulfur content of fuel oil for vessels operating in waters not already considered emissions control areas and more stringent requirements for management and treatment of ballast water. 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
The Company expects to install ballast water treatment systems on its vessels at substantial capital cost and incur increased operating expenses between 2019 and 2023. Although the Company has performed due diligence in choosing the particular systems, there is no assurance that the technologies chosen will perform as expected or be installed without delays. 
The Company continues to be in full compliance with the USCG&#8217;s phase-in schedule for ballast water treatment systems and has received extensions from the USCG for six vessels. The EPA determined in 2013 that it will not issue extensions under the VGP but stated that vessels that meet certain conditions, including having received the USCG extensions, would be a &#8220;low enforcement priority&#8221;. While the six vessels with USCG extensions are not in compliance with the EPA&#8217;s phase-in schedule, OSG believes that its vessels will meet the conditions for a low enforcement priority.&#8221; However, no assurance is given that EPA will not change their position. If the EPA determines to enforce the limits for such vessels, such action could have a material adverse effect on OSG. See Item 1, &#8220;Business - Environmental, Safety and Security Matters.&#8221; 
Other government regulation of vessels, particularly in the areas of safety and environmental requirements, can be expected to become stricter in the future and require the Company to incur significant capital expenditures on its vessels to keep them in compliance, or even to scrap or sell certain vessels altogether. Such expenditures could result in financial and operational impacts that may be material to OSG&#8217;s financial statements. Additionally, the failure of a shipowner or bareboat charterer to comply with local, domestic and foreign regulations may subject it to increased liability, may invalidate existing insurance or decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports. If any of our vessels are denied access to, or are detained in, certain ports, reputation, business, financial results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. 
Incidents involving highly publicized oil spills and other mishaps involving vessels can be expected in the tanker industry, and such events could be expected to result in the adoption of even stricter laws and regulations, which could limit the Company&#8217;s operations or its ability to do business and which could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial results and cash flows. In addition, the Company is required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain certain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to its operations. The Company believes its vessels are maintained in good condition in compliance with present regulatory requirements, are operated in compliance with applicable safety and environmental laws and regulations and are insured against usual risks for such amounts as the Company&#8217;s management deems appropriate. The vessels&#8217; operating certificates and licenses are renewed periodically during each vessel&#8217;s required annual survey. However, government regulation of tankers, particularly in the areas of safety and environmental impact, may change in the future and require the Company to incur significant capital expenditures with respect to its ships to keep them in compliance. 
Due to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries, including the United States, and international organizations, including the IMO and the European Union, have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These regulatory measures include, among others, adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. Such actions could result in significant financial and operational impacts on the Company&#8217;s business, including requiring OSG to install new emission controls, acquire allowances or pay taxes related to its greenhouse gas emissions, or administer and manage a greenhouse gas emission program. The Company is calculating and reporting greenhouse gas emissions on voyages to and from EU ports under the EU&#8217;s Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) scheme, and a similar requirement has been expanded to all vessels engaged on international voyage under a similar IMO program. See Item 1, &#8220;Business - Environmental, Safety and Security Matters.&#8221; In addition to the added costs, the concern over climate change and regulatory measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may reduce global demand for oil and oil products, which would have an adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial results and cash flows. 
The employment of the Company&#8217;s vessels could be adversely affected by an inability to clear the oil majors&#8217; risk assessment process. 
Our industry is heavily regulated. In addition, the major oil companies have developed a strict due diligence process for selecting their shipping partners out of concerns for the environmental impact of spills. This vetting process has evolved into a sophisticated and comprehensive risk assessment of both the vessel manager and the vessel. The Company&#8217;s charterers require that the Company&#8217;s vessels and the technical managers pass vetting inspections and management audits. The Company&#8217;s failure to maintain any of its vessels to these standards could put the Company in breach of the applicable charter agreement and lead to termination of such agreement thereby adversely affecting the revenues of the Company. 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
The Company may be subject to litigation and government inquiries or investigations that, if not resolved in the Company&#8217;s favor and not sufficiently covered by insurance, could have a material adverse effect on it. 
The Company has been and is, from time to time, involved in various litigation matters and is subject to government inquiries and investigations. These matters may include, among other things, contract disputes, personal injury claims, environmental claims or proceedings, asbestos and other toxic tort claims, employment matters, governmental claims for taxes or duties, and other disputes that arise in the ordinary course of the Company&#8217;s business. The Company believes it has sufficient insurance coverage for the majority, though not all, of these cases. 
Although the Company intends to defend these matters vigorously, it cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any such matter, and the ultimate outcome of these matters or the potential costs to resolve them could involve or result in significant expenditures or losses by the Company, or result in significant changes to OSG&#8217;s rules and practices in dealing with its customers, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s future operating results. Insurance may not be applicable or sufficient in all cases. Because litigation is inherently uncertain, the Company&#8217;s estimates for contingent liabilities may be insufficient to cover the actual liabilities from such claims, resulting in a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See Item 3, &#8220;Legal Proceedings,&#8221; and Note 21, &#8220;Contingencies,&#8221; to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statement and Supplementary Data.&#8221; 
Maritime claimants could arrest OSG&#8217;s vessels, which could interrupt cash flows. 
Crew members, suppliers of goods and services to a vessel, shippers of cargo and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against that vessel for unsatisfied debts, claims or damages. In many jurisdictions, a maritime lien holder may enforce its lien by arresting a vessel through foreclosure proceedings. The arrest or attachment of one or more of the Company&#8217;s vessels could interrupt OSG&#8217;s cash flow and require it to pay a significant amount of money to have the arrest lifted. Claimants could try to assert &#8220;sister ship&#8221; liability against one vessel in the Company&#8217;s fleet for claims relating to another vessel in its fleet which, if successful, could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Transfers or issuances of the Company&#8217;s equity may impair or reduce the Company&#8217;s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes in the future. 
Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an &#8220;ownership change&#8221; to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change. An &#8220;ownership change&#8221; is generally defined as any change in ownership of more than 50% of a corporation&#8217;s stock over a rolling three-year period by stockholders that own (directly or indirectly) 5% or more of the stock of a corporation, or arising from a new issuance of stock by a corporation. If an ownership change occurs, Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the use of pre-ownership change NOLs, credits and certain other tax attributes to offset taxable income earned after the ownership change. The annual limitation is equal to the product of the applicable long-term tax exempt rate and the value of the company&#8217;s stock immediately before the ownership change. This annual limitation may be adjusted to reflect any unused annual limitation for prior years and certain recognized built-in gains and losses for the year. In addition, Section 383 generally limits the amount of tax liability in any post-ownership change year that can be reduced by pre-ownership change tax credit carryforwards. If the Company were to undergo an &#8220;ownership change,&#8221; it could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Risks Related to the Common Stock and Warrants 
The market price of the Company&#8217;s securities fluctuates significantly . 
The market price of the Company&#8217;s securities fluctuates substantially. You may not be able to resell your Class A common stock or Class A warrants at or above the price you paid for such securities due to a number of factors, some of which are beyond the Company&#8217;s control, including the occurrence of the risks described herein. The falling price of the Company&#8217;s equity securities may expose the Company to securities class action litigation, which could result in substantial cost and the diversion of management&#8217;s attention and resources. 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
The ability to sell warrants may be limited and the exercise of outstanding warrants may result in substantial dilution to the Company&#8217;s stockholders. 
The Company&#8217;s Class A warrants are currently traded as &#8220;restricted securities&#8221; in the over-the-counter market and in privately negotiated transactions among individual holders pursuant to exemptions from the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Transactions are reported as taking place only sporadically. The liquidity of any market that may develop for the Class A warrants, the ability to sell the Class A warrants and the price at which such securities would sell are all uncertain. 
The Company has outstanding Class A warrants with an exercise price of $0.01 per share exercisable into shares of Class A common stock. If exercised, the shares of Class A common stock underlying these warrants would represent approximately 19% of the Company&#8217;s outstanding Class A common stock. Accordingly, any such exercise may result in substantial dilution to the Company&#8217;s stockholders. 
The Company&#8217;s common stock is subject to restrictions on foreign ownership, which could have a negative impact on the transferability of the Company&#8217;s common stock, its liquidity and market value, and on a change of control of the Company. 
The Company&#8217;s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws authorize its Board of Directors to establish certain rules, policies and procedures, including procedures with respect to transfer of shares, to assist in monitoring and maintaining compliance with the Jones Act ownership restrictions. In order to provide a reasonable margin for compliance with the Jones Act at least 77% (the &#8220;Minimum Percentage&#8221;) of the outstanding shares of each class of capital stock of the Company must be owned by U.S. citizens. To assist the Company in complying with the Jones Act citizenship requirements, the Company participates in the Depository Trust Company's (&#8220;DTC&#8221;) Seg&#8211;100 program. Under this system, shares of our common stock beneficially owned by non&#8211;U.S. citizens through DTC must be deposited in a segregated account known as Seg&#8211;100. 
Any purported transfer by a foreign holder of equity interests in the Company that cause the percentage of outstanding shares of a class of capital stock of the Company to fall below the Minimum Percentage will be rendered ineffective to transfer the equity interests or any voting, dividend or other rights associated with such interest in accordance with the rights afforded in the Jones Act and contained in the Company&#8217;s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws. 
The percentage of U.S. citizenship ownership of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common stock fluctuates based on daily trading, and at times in the past, has declined to the Minimum Percentage. At and during such time that the Minimum Percentage is reached, the Company will not issue any further shares of such class of common stock or approve transfers of such class of common stock to non-U.S. citizens. If a foreign owner's acquisition causes total foreign ownership of our common stock to exceed the limit set forth in our Citizenship Policies, currently 23%, DTC will not permit additional shares to be deposited in the Company's Seg&#8211;100 account. This is an additional risk that foreign owners of our common stock bear. 
The existence and enforcement of these ownership restrictions could have an adverse impact on the liquidity or market value of the Company&#8217;s equity securities. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, the ownership restrictions could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of the Company. 
The Company&#8217;s outstanding warrants are not subject to the above ownership restrictions, but the warrants include provisions limiting the right of non-U.S. citizens to exercise warrants if the shares of common stock that would be issued upon exercise would cause the percentage of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common stock held by U.S. citizens to decline below the Minimum Percentage. 
OSG is a holding company and depends on the ability of its subsidiaries to distribute funds to it in order to satisfy its financial obligations or pay dividends. 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. is a holding company and its subsidiaries conduct all of its operations and own all of its operating assets. It has no significant assets other than the equity interests in its subsidiaries. As a result, its ability to satisfy its financial obligations or pay dividends is dependent on the ability of its subsidiaries to distribute funds to it. In addition, the &#32; terms of the term loan, due 2023, term loan, due 2026 and the ABL Facility restrict the ability of OBS and its subsidiaries to distribute funds to Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
Some provisions of Delaware law and the Company&#8217;s governing documents could influence its ability to effect a change of control. 
Certain provisions of Delaware law and contained in the Company&#8217;s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of the Company. In addition, these provisions could make it more difficult to bring about a change in the composition of the Company&#8217;s board of directors. For example, the Company&#8217;s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws: 
give the sole ability to then-current members of its board of directors to fill a vacancy on the board of directors; 
require the affirmative vote of two-thirds or more of the combined voting power of the outstanding shares of its capital stock in order to amend or repeal certain provisions of its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws; and 
establish advance notice requirements for nomination for elections to its board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. 
Separately, the Company has elected to opt out of Section 203 (&#8220;Section 203&#8221;) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the &#8220;DGCL&#8221;), which restricts certain business combinations between a Delaware corporation and an &#8220;interested stockholder.&#8221; Accordingly, the Company will be able to enter into such transactions with its principal stockholders without complying with the requirements of Section 203. The election to opt out of Section 203 could deprive certain stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of the Company, particularly if it enters into a transaction with an &#8220;interested stockholder.&#8221; 
Securities analysts may not initiate coverage or continue to cover the Company&#8217;s securities, and this may have a negative impact on their market price. 
The trading market for the Company&#8217;s securities will depend in part on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about the Company and its business. The Company does not have any control over securities analysts and they may not initiate coverage or continue to cover the Company&#8217;s securities. If securities analysts do not cover the Company&#8217;s securities, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect their market price. If the Company is covered by securities analysts, and the Company&#8217;s securities are the subject of an unfavorable report, the Company&#8217;s securities prices would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover the Company or fails to publish regular reports on the Company, the Company could lose visibility in the financial markets, which may cause the price or trading volume of the Company&#8217;s securities to decline.

Risks Related to Our Industry 
The highly cyclical nature of supply and demand in the industry may lead to volatile changes in charter rates and vessel values, which could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s earnings, liquidity and available cash. 
The marine transportation industry is both cyclical and volatile in terms of charter rates and profitability. Fluctuations in charter rates and vessel values result from changes in supply and demand both for tanker capacity and for oil and oil products. Factors affecting these changes in supply and demand are generally outside of the Company&#8217;s control. The nature, timing and degree of changes in industry conditions are unpredictable and could adversely affect the values of the Company&#8217;s vessels or result in significant fluctuations in the amount of charter revenues the Company earns, which could result in significant volatility in OSG&#8217;s quarterly results and cash flows. Factors influencing the demand for tanker capacity include: 
supply and demand for, and availability of, energy resources such as oil, oil products and natural gas, which affect customers&#8217; need for vessel capacity; 
global and regional economic and political conditions, including armed conflicts, terrorist activities and strikes, that among other things could impact the supply of oil, as well as trading patterns and the demand for various vessel types; 
regional availability of refining capacity and inventories; 
changes in the production levels of crude oil (including in particular production by OPEC, the United States and other key producers); 
changes in seaborne and other transportation patterns, including changes in the distances that cargoes are transported, changes in the price of crude oil and changes to the West Texas Intermediate and Brent Crude Oil pricing benchmarks; 
environmental and other legal and regulatory developments and concerns; 
construction or expansion of new or existing pipelines or railways; 
weather and natural disasters; 
competition from alternative sources of energy; and 
international sanctions, embargoes, import and export restrictions or nationalizations and wars. 
Many of the factors that influence the demand for tanker capacity will also, in the longer term, effectively influence the supply of tanker capacity, since decisions to build new capacity, invest in capital repairs, or to retain in service older capacity are influenced by the general state of the marine transportation industry from time to time. Factors influencing the supply of vessel capacity include: 
the number of newbuilding deliveries; 
the conversion of vessels from transporting oil and oil products to carrying dry bulk cargo or vice versa; 
the number of vessels that are removed from service, whether via scrapping or conversion to storage or other means; 
availability and pricing of other energy sources such as natural gas for which tankers can be used or to which construction capacity may be dedicated; 
port or canal congestion; and 
environmental and maritime regulations. 
The market value of vessels fluctuates significantly, which could adversely affect OSG&#8217;s liquidity or otherwise adversely affect its financial condition. 
Jones Act vessel market values have, on average, generally declined over the past several years; however the market value of Jones Act vessels has fluctuated over time an dis based upon various factors, including: 
age of the vessel; 
general economic and market conditions affecting the tanker industry, including the availability of vessel financing; 
number of vessels in the Jones Act fleet; 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
types and sizes of vessels available; 
changes in trading patterns affecting demand for particular sizes and types of vessels; 
cost of newbuildings; 
prevailing level of charter rates; 
competition from other shipping companies and from other modes of transportation; and 
technological advances in vessel design and propulsion. 
The fluctuating market values of the vessels can impact the Company&#8217;s liquidity regardless of whether the Company sells the vessels or continues to hold the vessels. For example, if OSG sells a vessel at a sale price that is less than the vessel&#8217;s carrying amount on the Company&#8217;s financial statements, OSG will incur a loss on the sale and a reduction in earnings and surplus. On the other hand, declining values of the Company&#8217;s vessels could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s liquidity by limiting its ability to raise cash by refinancing vessels. 
Even if the Company does not need immediate liquidity from the sale or refinancing of vessels, the Company may experience significant impairment charges upon a decline in vessel value. The Company evaluates events and changes in circumstances that have occurred to determine whether they indicate that the carrying amount of the vessels might not be recoverable. This review for potential impairment indicators and projection of future cash flows related to the vessels is complex and requires the Company to make various estimates, including future freight rates, earnings from the vessels, market appraisals and discount rates, all of which have historically been volatile. The Company evaluates the recoverable amount of a vessel as the sum of its undiscounted estimated future cash flows. If the recoverable amount is less than the vessel&#8217;s carrying amount, the vessel&#8217;s carrying amount is then compared to its estimated fair value, which is determined using vessel appraisals or discounted estimated future cash flows. If the vessel&#8217;s carrying amount is less than its fair value, it is deemed impaired. The carrying values of the Company&#8217;s vessels may differ significantly from their fair market value. Any charges relating to such impairments could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. 
An increase in the supply of Jones Act vessels without a commensurate increase in demand for such vessels could cause charter rates to decline, which could adversely affect OSG&#8217;s revenues, profitability and cash flows, as well as the value of its vessels. 
The marine transportation industry has historically been highly cyclical, as the profitability and asset values of companies in the industry have fluctuated based on changes in the supply of and demand for vessels. If the number of new ships of a particular class delivered exceeds the number of vessels of that class being scrapped, available capacity in that class will increase. Given the smaller number of tankers operating in the U.S. domestic market, the impact of even a limited increase in capacity supply may negatively affect the market and may have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s revenues, profitability and cash flows. 
OSG conducts certain of its operations internationally, which subjects the Company to changing economic, political and governmental conditions abroad that may adversely affect its business. 
The Company conducts certain of its operations internationally, and its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected by changing economic, political and government conditions in the countries and regions where its vessels are employed. 
OSG must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, anti-money laundering laws; and anti-competition regulations. Moreover, the shipping industry is generally considered to present elevated risks in these areas. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on the Company&#8217;s business operations and on the Company&#8217;s ability to transport cargo to one or more countries, and could also materially affect the Company&#8217;s brand, ability to attract and retain employees, international operations, business and operating results. Although OSG has policies and procedures designed to achieve compliance with these laws and regulations, OSG cannot be certain that its employees, contractors, joint venture partners or agents will not violate these policies and procedures. OSG&#8217;s operations may also subject its employees and agents to extortion attempts. 
Changes in fuel prices may adversely affect profits. 
Fuel is a significant, if not the largest, expense in the Company&#8217;s shipping operations when vessels are under voyage charter. Accordingly, an increase in the price of fuel may adversely affect the Company&#8217;s profitability if these increases cannot be passed onto customers. The price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside the Company&#8217;s control, including geopolitical developments; supply and demand for oil and gas; actions by OPEC, and other oil and gas producers; war and unrest in oil producing countries and regions; regional production patterns; and environmental concerns. 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
Fuel may become much more expensive in the future, which could reduce the profitability and competitiveness of the Company&#8217;s business compared to other forms of transportation. 
Shipping is a business with inherent risks, and OSG&#8217;s insurance may not be adequate to cover its losses. 
OSG&#8217;s vessels and their cargoes are at risk of being damaged or lost because of events including, but not limited to: 
marine disasters; 
bad weather; 
mechanical failures; 
human error; 
war, terrorism and piracy; 
grounding, fire, explosions and collisions; 
business interruptions due to labor strikes, port closings and boycotts and 
other unforeseen circumstances or events. 
These hazards may result in death or injury to persons; loss of revenues or property; environmental damage; higher insurance rates; damage to OSG&#8217;s existing customer relationships and industry reputation; and market disruptions, and delay or rerouting, all of which may also subject OSG to litigation. In addition, the operation of tankers has unique operational risks associated with the transportation of oil. An oil spill may cause significant environmental damage and the associated costs could exceed the insurance coverage available to the Company. Compared to other types of vessels, tankers are also exposed to a higher risk of damage and loss by fire, whether ignited by a terrorist attack, collision, or other cause, due to the high flammability and high volume of the oil transported in tankers. Any of these events could result in loss of revenues, decreased cash flows and increased costs. 
While the Company carries insurance to protect against certain of these risks, risks may arise against which the Company is not adequately insured. For example, a catastrophic spill could exceed OSG&#8217;s $1 billion per vessel insurance coverage and have a material adverse effect on its operations. In addition, OSG may not be able to procure adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates in the future, and any particular claim may not be paid by its insurers. In the past, new and stricter environmental regulations have led to higher costs for insurance covering environmental damage or pollution, and new regulations could lead to similar increases or even make this type of insurance unavailable. 
Furthermore, even if insurance coverage is adequate to cover the Company&#8217;s liabilities arising from the loss of a vessel, OSG may not be able to timely obtain a replacement ship. 
OSG may also be subject to calls, or premiums, in amounts based not only on its own claim records but also the claim records of all other members of the protection and indemnity associations through which OSG obtains insurance coverage for tort liability. OSG&#8217;s payment of these calls could result in significant expenses which would reduce its profits and cash flows or cause losses. 
Constraints on capital availability have adversely affected the tanker industry and OSG&#8217;s business. 
Constraints on capital that have occurred during recent years have adversely affected the financial condition of certain of the Company&#8217;s customers, financial lenders and suppliers. Entities that suffer a material adverse impact on their financial condition may be unable or unwilling to comply with their contractual commitments to OSG including the refusal or inability of customers to pay charter hire to OSG or the inability or unwillingness of financial lenders to honor their commitments to lend funds. While OSG seeks to monitor the financial condition of its customers, financial lenders and suppliers, the availability and accuracy of information about the financial condition of such entities and the actions that OSG may take to reduce possible losses resulting from the failure of such entities to comply with their contractual obligations may be limited. Any such failure could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s revenues, profitability and cash flows. In addition, adverse financial conditions may inhibit these entities from entering into new commitments with OSG, which could also have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s revenues, profitability and cash flows. 
The Company also faces other potential constraints on capital relating to counterparty credit risk and constraints on OSG&#8217;s ability to borrow funds. See also, &#8220;Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Company - The Company is subject to credit risks with respect to its counterparties on contracts and any failure by these counterparties to meet their obligations could cause the Company to suffer losses on such contracts, decreasing revenues and earnings&#8221; and &#8220; Risks Related to Our Company - OSG has incurred significant indebtedness which could affect its ability to finance its operations, pursue desirable business 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
opportunities and successfully run its business in the future, all of which could affect OSG&#8217;s ability to fulfill its obligations under that indebtedness.&#8221; 
Public health threats could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s operations and financial results. 
Public health threats and other highly communicable diseases, outbreaks of which have already occurred in various parts of the world near where OSG operates, could adversely impact the Company&#8217;s operations, the operations of the Company&#8217;s customers and the global economy, including the worldwide demand for crude oil and the level of demand for OSG&#8217;s services. Any quarantine of personnel, restrictions on travel to or from countries in which OSG operates, or inability to access certain areas could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s operations. Travel restrictions, operational problems or large-scale social unrest in any part of the world in which OSG operates, or any reduction in the demand for tanker services caused by public health threats in the future, may impact OSG&#8217;s operations and adversely affect the Company&#8217;s financial results. 
Acts of piracy on ocean-going vessels could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business. 
Although the Company&#8217;s fleet operates mainly in U.S. waters, there are occasions when a vessel may be in an area where pirate attacks are a concern. The frequency of pirate attacks on seagoing vessels remains high, particularly in the western part of the Indian Ocean, off the west coast of Africa and in the South China Sea. If piracy attacks result in regions in which the Company&#8217;s vessels are deployed being characterized by insurers as &#8220;war risk&#8221; zones, as the Gulf of Aden has been, or Joint War Committee &#8220;war and strikes&#8221; listed areas, premiums payable for insurance coverage could increase significantly, and such insurance coverage may become difficult to obtain. Crew costs could also increase in such circumstances due to risks of piracy attacks. 
In addition, while OSG believes the charterer remains liable for charter payments when a vessel is seized by pirates, the charterer may dispute this and withhold charter hire until the vessel is released. A charterer may also claim that a vessel seized by pirates was not &#8220;on-hire&#8221; for a certain number of days and it is therefore entitled to cancel the charter party, a claim the Company would dispute. The Company may not be adequately insured to cover losses from these incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, hijacking as a result of an act of piracy against the Company&#8217;s vessels, or an increase in the cost (or unavailability) of insurance for those vessels, could have a material adverse impact on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Such attacks may also impact the Company&#8217;s customers, which could impair their ability to make payments to the Company under its charters. 
Terrorist attacks and international hostilities and instability can affect the tanker industry, which could adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business. 
Terrorist attacks, the outbreak of war, or the existence of international hostilities could damage the world economy, adversely affect the availability of and demand for crude oil and petroleum products and adversely affect both the Company&#8217;s ability to charter its vessels and the charter rates payable under any such charters. In addition, OSG operates in a sector of the economy that is likely to be adversely impacted by the effects of political instability, terrorist or other attacks, war or international hostilities. In the past, political instability has also resulted in attacks on vessels, mining of waterways and other efforts to disrupt international shipping, particularly in the Arabian Gulf region. These factors could also increase the costs to the Company of conducting its business, particularly crew, insurance and security costs, and prevent or restrict the Company from obtaining insurance coverage, all of which could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Risks Related to Our Company 
As a result of the spin-off of INSW on November 30, 2016, OSG&#8217;s historical financial information may not be a reliable indicator of OSG&#8217;s future financial results and the spin-off may adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business. 
In accordance with Accounting Standards Update 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, &#32;the assets and liabilities and results of operations of INSW are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Accordingly, all references made to financial data in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are to OSG&#8217;s continuing operations, unless specifically noted. Accordingly, the historical financial information included in this Annual Report does not necessarily reflect the financial condition, operating performance or cash flows that OSG would have achieved without INSW as a wholly owned subsidiary during the periods presented or those that OSG will achieve in the future, including as a result of the following factors: 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
Prior to the spin-off, OSG or one of its affiliates performed various corporate functions for INSW, such as treasury, accounting, auditing, legal, investor relations and finance. OSG&#8217;s historical results reflect allocations of corporate expenses to INSW for such functions. In connection with the spin-off, OSG may incur additional expenses for such services after the spin-off. 
As a result of the spin-off, the cost of capital of OSG&#8217;s business may be higher than its cost of capital prior to the spin-off. 
OSG may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the spin-off or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. The anticipated benefits may not be achieved for a variety of reasons, including among others: 
The separation of our business from INSW and provision of services to INSW under the Transition Services Agreement require significant amounts of management&#8217;s time and effort in developing standalone organizations which may divert management&#8217;s attention from operating and growing OSG&#8217;s business; 
Following the spin-off, OSG may be more vulnerable to the risk of takeover by third parties; 
Following the spin-off, OSG may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than if INSW was still a part of OSG; and 
Following the spin-off, OSG&#8217;s business is less diversified and has a more concentrated exposure to U.S specific risks such as the Jones Act market than prior to the spin-off. 
If OSG fails to achieve some or all of the benefits to result from the spin-off, or if such benefits are delayed, it could have an adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s competitive position, financial condition, operating results or cash flows. 
OSG has incurred significant indebtedness which could affect its ability to finance its operations, pursue desirable business opportunities and successfully run its business in the future, all of which could affect OSG&#8217;s ability to fulfill its obligations under that indebtedness. 
As of December 31, 2017, OSG had $448.9 million of outstanding indebtedness. OSG&#8217;s substantial indebtedness and interest expense could have important consequences, including: 
limiting OSG&#8217;s ability to use a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations in other areas of its business, including for working capital, capital expenditures and other general business activities, because OSG must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to service its debt; 
to the extent OSG&#8217;s future cash flows are insufficient, requiring the Company to seek to incur additional indebtedness in order to make planned capital expenditures and other expenses or investments; 
limiting OSG&#8217;s ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and other expenses or investments planned by the Company; 
limiting the Company&#8217;s flexibility and ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures and adverse changes in government regulation, and OSG&#8217;s business and industry; 
limiting OSG&#8217;s ability to satisfy its obligations under its indebtedness; 
increasing OSG&#8217;s vulnerability to a downturn in its business and to adverse economic and industry conditions generally; 
placing OSG at a competitive disadvantage as compared to its less-leveraged competitors; 
limiting the Company&#8217;s ability, or increasing the costs, to refinance indebtedness; and 
limiting the Company&#8217;s ability to enter into hedging transactions by reducing the number of counterparties with whom OSG can enter into such transactions as well as the volume of those transactions. 
OSG&#8217;s ability to continue to fund its obligations and to reduce debt may be affected by general economic, financial market, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, among other things. An inability to fund the Company&#8217;s debt requirements or reduce debt could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Additionally, the actual or perceived credit quality of the Company&#8217;s charterers (as well as any defaults by them) could materially affect the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain the additional capital resources that it will require to purchase additional vessels or significantly increase the costs of obtaining such capital. The Company&#8217;s inability to obtain additional financing at a higher-than-anticipated cost, or at all, could materially affect the Company&#8217;s results of operations and its ability to implement its business strategy. 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
The Company may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of its indebtedness, and could in the future breach covenants in its credit facilities and term loans. 
The Company&#8217;s earnings, cash flow and the market value of its vessels vary significantly over time due to the cyclical nature of the tanker industry, as well as general economic and market conditions affecting the industry. As a result, the amount of debt that OSG can manage in some periods may not be appropriate in other periods and its ability to meet the financial covenants to which it is subject or may be subject in the future may vary. Additionally, future cash flow may be insufficient to meet the Company&#8217;s debt obligations and commitments. Any insufficiency could negatively impact OSG&#8217;s business. 
The OBS Term Loan and the ABL Facility contain certain restrictions relating to new borrowings and, the movement of funds between OBS and OSG, as set forth in the loan agreement. Furthermore, drawdowns under the OBS ABL Facility borrowings are limited based upon the available borrowing base, as defined in that loan agreement and, if availability falls below a certain amount for a specified period of time, the administrative agent could exercise cash dominion rights permitting it to invoke control rights over certain of our accounts. While the Company was in compliance with these requirements as of December 31, 2017, a decrease in vessel values could cause the Company to breach certain covenants its existing credit facilities and term loans, or in future financing agreements that the Company may enter into from time to time. If the Company breaches such covenants and is unable to remedy the relevant breach or obtain a waiver, the Company&#8217;s lenders could accelerate its debt and foreclose on the Company&#8217;s owned vessels. 
A range of economic, competitive, financial, business, industry and other factors will affect future financial performance, and, accordingly, the Company&#8217;s ability to generate cash flow from operations and to pay debt. Many of these factors, such as charter rates, economic and financial conditions in the tanker industry and the economy, the creditworthiness of our customers, or competitive initiatives of competitors, are beyond the Company&#8217;s control. If OSG does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy its debt obligations, it may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as: 
refinancing or restructuring its debt; 
selling tankers or other assets; 
reducing or delaying investments and capital expenditures; or 
seeking to raise additional capital. 
Undertaking alternative financing plans, if necessary, might not allow OSG to meet its debt obligations. The Company&#8217;s ability to restructure or refinance its debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets, its access to such markets and its financial condition at that time. The 8.125% unsecured Notes will mature on March 30, 2018. To remain in compliance with the OBS ABL Facility, the Company paid off the outstanding balance on its 8.125% unsecured Notes in December 2017. Any refinancing of debt could be at higher interest rates and might require the Company to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict OSG&#8217;s business operations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict OSG from adopting certain alternatives. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit OSG to meet its scheduled debt service obligations. The Company&#8217;s inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its debt obligations, to meet the covenants of its credit agreements and term loans and/or to obtain alternative financing in such circumstances, could materially and adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Changes in demand in specialized markets in which the Company currently operates or changes in governmental support may lead the Company to redeploy certain vessels to other markets or put its ability to participate in specialized markets at risk. 
The Company deploys its vessels in several niche markets, including lightering in the Delaware Bay. The Company conducts those lightering operations with two ATBs which were purpose built for these operations using funds withdrawn from the Capital Construction Fund. If there is lower demand for these vessels in the Delaware Bay lightering market, the Company may have to redeploy one or both of these two ATBs in other markets. If that were to occur, the Company may not be able to compete profitably in the new markets, and the ATBs may not be able to be redeployed to new markets without substantial modification. In addition, the Company would be required to pay daily liquidated damages to MarAd if those vessels were deployed in the contiguous coastwise trades. 
The Company has two vessels participating in the MSP which derive a substantial percentage of revenues earned from transporting cargoes reserved for U.S. Flag vessels under MaRad&#8217;s Cargo Preference program. The Cargo Preference program works to promote and facilitate a U.S. maritime transportation system and oversees the administration of and compliance with U.S. cargo preference laws and regulations. Those laws require shippers to give U.S.-flag vessels a preference to transport any government-impelled ocean borne cargoes. Government-impelled cargo is cargo that is moving either as a direct result of 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
Federal government involvement, indirectly through financial sponsorship of a Federal program, or in connection with a guarantee provided by the Federal government. 
Among the currently available government-impelled cargoes is a contract the Company has with the government of Israel (""GOI"") to deliver fuel, which the GOI has in the past funded with grants from the U.S. government. In September 2016, an agreement between the U.S. government and the GOI restricted the GOI's ability to use these grants to purchase fuel beginning in 2019. This restriction could result in the GOI terminating its agreement with OSG. While other government-impelled cargoes may be available to replace cargoes currently transported under the GOI contract, there is no assurance the Company will be able to secure replacement cargoes at rates or in quantities sufficient to replace revenues currently earned under the GOI contract. If the Company is unable to retain the GOI business, or is unable to obtain significant other charters for these vessels, the Company may no longer be able to participate in the MSP and the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected. 
The Company operates three Jones Act MR Tankers as shuttle tankers serving offshore oil installations in the Gulf of Mexico. Modifications made to enable these tankers to perform the specialized service of a shuttle tanker required the Company to incur substantial capital costs, which in turn allow the Company to earn a premium to market rates earned by conventional Jones Act tankers. While shuttle tankers can serve as conventional tankers without further modification, future reduction in the demand for specialized shuttle tanker services could limit the Company&#8217;s ability to earn such premiums, which could adversely affect the financial results of the Company as compared to historical results. 
In the highly competitive Jones Act market, OSG may not be able to compete effectively for charters. 
The Company&#8217;s vessels are employed in a highly competitive market. Competition arises from other vessel owners, including major oil companies, which may have substantially greater resources than OSG does. Competition for the transportation of crude oil and other petroleum products depends on price; location; size, age and condition of vessel; and the acceptability of the vessel operator to the charterer. To the extent OSG enters into new geographic regions or provides new services, it may not be able to compete profitably. New markets may involve competitive factors that differ from those of the Company&#8217;s current markets, and the competitors in those markets may have greater financial strength and capital resources than OSG does. 
OSG may not be able to renew Time Charters when they expire or enter into new Time Charters. 
OSG&#8217;s ability to renew expiring contracts or obtain new charters will depend on the prevailing market conditions at the time of renewal. As of December 31, 2017, OSG employed 11 vessels on Time Charters, with six of those charters expiring in 2018, three expiring in 2019, one expiring in 2020 and one expiring in 2025. The Company&#8217;s existing Time Charters may not be renewed at comparable rates or if renewed or entered into, those new contracts may be at less favorable rates. In addition, there may be a gap in employment of vessels between current charters and subsequent charters. If at a time when OSG is seeking to arrange new charters for its vessels, market participants expect that less capacity will be necessary in the future (for example, if it is expected that oil and natural gas prices will decrease in the future, which could suggest that future oil and gas production levels will decline from then-current levels), OSG may not be able to obtain charters at attractive rates or at all. If, upon expiration of the existing Time Charter, OSG is unable to obtain Time Charters or Voyage Charters at desirable rates, the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected. 
OSG may not realize the benefits it expects from future acquisitions or other strategic transactions it may make. 
OSG&#8217;s business strategy includes ongoing efforts to engage in material acquisitions of assets or ownership interests in entities in the tanker industry and of individual tankers. The success of OSG&#8217;s acquisitions will depend upon a number of factors, some of which may not be within its control. These factors include OSG&#8217;s ability to: 
identify suitable tankers and/or shipping companies for acquisitions at attractive prices, which may not be possible if asset prices rise too quickly; 
obtain financing; 
identify businesses engaged in managing, operating or owning tankers for acquisitions or joint ventures; 
integrate any acquired tankers or businesses successfully with the OSG&#8217;s then-existing operations; and 
enhance OSG&#8217;s customer base. 
OSG intends to finance any future acquisitions by using available cash from operations and through incurrence of debt or bridge financing, either of which may increase its leverage ratios, or by issuing equity, which may have a dilutive impact on its existing stockholders. At any given time, OSG may be engaged in a number of discussions that may result in one or more acquisitions, some of which may be material to OSG as a whole. These opportunities require confidentiality and may involve 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
negotiations that require quick responses by OSG. Although there can be no certainty that any of these discussions will result in definitive agreements or the completion of any transactions, the announcement of any such transaction may lead to increased volatility in the trading price of OSG&#8217;s securities. 
Acquisitions and other transactions can also involve a number of special risks and challenges, including: 
diversion of management time and attention from the Company&#8217;s existing business and other business opportunities; 
delays in closing or the inability to close an acquisition for any reason, including third-party consents or approvals; 
any unanticipated negative impact on the Company of disclosed or undisclosed matters relating to any vessels or operations acquired; and 
assumption of debt or other liabilities of the acquired business, including litigation related to the acquired business. 
The success of acquisitions or strategic investments depends on the effective integration of newly acquired businesses or assets into OSG&#8217;s current operations. Such integration is subject to risks and uncertainties, including realization of anticipated synergies and cost savings, the ability to retain and attract personnel and customers, the diversion of management&#8217;s attention from other business concerns, risk of non-compliance with internal controls over financial reporting for an acquired company, in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of the acquired company or asset. Further, if a portion of the purchase price of a business is attributable to goodwill and if the acquired business does not perform up to expectations at the time of the acquisition some or all of the goodwill may be written off, adversely affecting OSG&#8217;s earnings. 
The Company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from a limited number of customers, and the loss of, or reduction in business by, any of these customers could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. 
The Company&#8217;s largest customers account for a significant portion of its revenues. The Company&#8217;s top three customers comprised approximately 41% of the Company&#8217;s revenues during 2017. The loss of, or reduction in business by, any of these customers could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition and results of operations. 
Certain potential customers will not use vessels older than a specified age, even if the vessels have been subsequently rebuilt. 
All of the Company&#8217;s existing ATBs with the exception of the OSG Vision/OSG 350 and the OSG Horizon/OSG 351 were originally constructed more than 25 years ago. While all of these tug-barge units were rebuilt and double-hulled since 1998 and are &#8220;in-class,&#8221; meaning the vessel has been certified by a Classification Society as being built and maintained in accordance with the rules of that Classification Society and complies with the applicable rules and regulations of the vessel&#8217;s country of registry and applicable international conventions, some potential customers have stated that they will not charter vessels that are more than 20 years old, even if they have been rebuilt. Other customers may not continue to view rebuilt vessels as suitable. With an increase in the supply of newer vessels, customers may become more selective. If more customers differentiate rebuilt vessels, time charter rates for the Company&#8217;s rebuilt ATBs will likely be adversely affected. 
The Company&#8217;s significant operating leases could be replaced on less favorable terms or may not be replaced. 
The Company&#8217;s operating fleet includes ten vessels that have been chartered-in under operating leases. The significant operating leases of the Company in its various businesses expire at various points in the future and may not be replaced at all or on as favorable terms, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s future financial position, results of operations and cash flow. 
The Company is subject to credit risks with respect to its counterparties on contracts, and any failure by those counterparties to meet their obligations could cause the Company to suffer losses on such contracts, decreasing revenues and earnings. 
The Company has entered into, and in the future will enter into, various contracts, including charter agreements and other agreements associated with the operation of its vessels. The Company charters its vessels to other parties, who pay the company a daily rate of hire. The Company also enters COAs and Voyage Charters. Historically, the Company has not experienced material problems collecting charter hire but the risk increases during economic downturns. Additionally, the Company enters into derivative contracts (interest rate swaps and caps) from time to time. As a result, the Company is subject to credit risks. The ability of each of the Company&#8217;s counterparties to perform its obligations under a contract with it will depend on a number of factors that are beyond the Company&#8217;s control and may include, among other things, general economic conditions; availability of debt or equity financing; the condition of the maritime and offshore industries; the overall financial condition of the counterparty including the bankrupcy of the counterparty; charter rates received for specific types of vessels; 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
and various expenses. Charterers are sensitive to the commodity markets and may be impacted by market forces affecting commodities such as oil. In addition, in depressed market conditions, the Company&#8217;s charterers and customers may no longer need a vessel that is currently under charter or contract or may be able to obtain a comparable vessel at lower rates. As a result, the Company&#8217;s customers may fail to pay charter hire or attempt to renegotiate charter rates. If the counterparties fail to meet their obligations, the Company could suffer losses on such contracts which would decrease revenues, cash flows and earnings. 
Operating costs and capital expenses will increase as the Company&#8217;s vessels age and may also increase due to unanticipated events relating to secondhand vessels and the consolidation of suppliers. 
In general, capital expenditures and other costs necessary for maintaining a vessel in good operating condition increase as the age of the vessel increases. As of December 31, 2017, the average age of the Company&#8217;s total owned and operated fleet was 10.1 years, which is based on the vessels&#8217; year of rebuild, where applicable. Cargo insurance rates are also expected to increase with the age of a vessel. Accordingly, it is likely that the operating costs of OSG&#8217;s currently operated vessels will increase. In addition, changes in governmental regulations and compliance with Classification Society standards may restrict the type of activities in which the vessels may engage and/or may require OSG to make additional expenditures for new equipment. Every commercial tanker must pass inspection by a Classification Society authorized by the vessel&#8217;s country of registry. The Classification Society certifies that a tanker is safe and seaworthy in accordance with the applicable rule and regulations of the country of registry of the tanker and the international conventions of which that country is a number. If a Classification Society requires the Company to add equipment, OSG may be required to incur substantial costs or take its vessels out of service. Market conditions may not justify such expenditures or permit OSG to operate its older vessels profitably even if those vessels remain operational. If a vessel in OSG&#8217;s fleet does not maintain its class and/or fails any survey, then it will be unemployable and unable to trade between ports, which would negatively impact the Company&#8217;s results of operation. 
Furthermore, recent mergers have reduced the number of available suppliers, resulting in fewer alternatives for sourcing key supplies. With respect to certain items, OSG is generally dependent upon the original equipment manufacturer for repair and replacement of the item or its spare parts. Supplier consolidation may result in a shortage of supplies and services, thereby increasing the cost of supplies or potentially inhibiting the ability of suppliers to deliver on time. These cost increases or delays could result in downtime, and delays in the repair and maintenance of the Company&#8217;s vessels and have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
The Company may face unexpected drydock costs for its vessels. 
Vessels must be drydocked periodically for inspection and maintenance, and in the event of accidents or other unforeseen damage. The cost of repairs and renewals required at each drydock are difficult to predict with certainty, can be substantial and the Company&#8217;s insurance may not cover these costs. Vessels in drydock will generally not generate any income. Large drydocking expenses could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the time when a vessel is out of service for maintenance is determined by a number of factors including regulatory deadlines, market conditions, shipyard availability and customer requirements. Large drydocking expenses and longer than anticipated off-hire time could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Technological innovation could reduce the Company&#8217;s charter income and the value of the Company&#8217;s vessels. 
The charter rates and the value and operational life of a vessel are determined by a number of factors including the vessel&#8217;s efficiency, operational flexibility and physical life. Efficiency includes speed, fuel economy and the ability to load and discharge cargo quickly. Flexibility includes the ability to enter harbors, utilize related docking facilities and pass through canals and straits. The length of a vessel&#8217;s physical life is related to its original design and construction, its maintenance and the impact of the stress of operations. Competition from more technologically advanced vessels could adversely affect the amount of charter payments the Company receives for its vessels once their initial charters expire and the resale value of the Company&#8217;s vessels could significantly decrease. As a result, the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. 
Interruption or failure of OSG&#8217;s information technology and communications systems could impair its ability to operate and adversely affect its business. 
OSG is highly dependent on information technology systems. These dependencies include accounting, billing, disbursement, cargo booking and tracking, vessel scheduling and stowage, equipment tracking, customer service, banking, payroll and communication systems. Information technology and communication systems are subject to reliability issues, integration and compatibility concerns, and security-threatening intrusions. OSG may experience failures caused by the occurrence of a natural disaster, computer hacking or viruses or other unanticipated problems at OSG&#8217;s facilities, aboard its vessels or at third-party 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
locations. Any failure of OSG&#8217;s or third-party systems could result in interruptions in service, reductions in its revenue and profits, damage to its reputation or liability for the release of confidential information. 
We store, process, maintain, and transmit confidential information through information technology systems. Cybersecurity issues, such as security breaches and computer viruses, affecting our information technology systems or those of our third party vendors, could disrupt our business, result in the unintended disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs, and cause losses. 
We collect, store and transmit sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and that of our clients, and personally identifiable information of our clients and employees, using both our information technology systems and those of third party vendors. The secure storage, processing, maintenance, and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Our network, or those of our clients or third party vendors, could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, and other security problems. Many companies have increasingly reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage. 
We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. Security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent security breaches (including the inability of our third party vendors to prevent security breaches) could also cause existing clients to lose confidence in our systems and could adversely affect our reputation, cause losses to us or our clients, damage our brand, and increase our costs. 
We could face significant liability if one or more multiemployer plans in which we participate is reported to have underfunded liabilities and we withdraw from participation in one or more multiemployer pension plans in which we participate. 
The Company is a party to collective-bargaining agreements that requires contributions to three jointly managed (Company and union) multiemployer pension plans covering seagoing personnel of U.S. Flag vessels. Our required contributions to these plans could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these plans, the inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability, low interest rates, lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. Certain of these multiemployer plans are currently underfunded. Significantly underfunded pension plans are required to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their under-funding. As a result, our required contributions to these plans may increase in the future. In addition, a termination of our voluntary withdrawal from or a mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from a underfunded multiemployer pension plan would require us to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of such multiemployer pension plan&#8217;s unfunded vested liabilities. See Note 17, &#8220;Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefit Plans,&#8221; to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 for additional information. Requirements to pay increased contributions or withdrawal liabilities could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and results of operations. 
The Company may have difficulty attracting and retaining skilled employees and is dependent on unionized employees. 
OSG&#8217;s success depends to a significant extent upon the abilities and efforts of its key personnel. The loss of the services of key personnel or the Company&#8217;s inability to attract, motivate and retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition and operating results. 
As of December 31, 2017, OSG had approximately 1,123 employees, of which 633 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions. See Item 1, &#8220;Business - Employees.&#8221; OSG could be adversely affected by actions taken by employees of OSG or other companies in related industries (including third parties providing services to OSG) against efforts by management to control labor costs, restrain wage or benefits increases or modify work practices or the failure of OSG or other companies in its industry to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements. 
Effective internal controls are necessary for the Company to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. 
The Company maintains a system of internal controls to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The process of designing and implementing effective internal controls is a continuous effort that requires the Company to anticipate and react to changes in its business and the economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy its reporting obligations as a public company. 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase the Company&#8217;s operating costs and harm its business. Furthermore, investors&#8217; perceptions that the Company&#8217;s internal controls are inadequate or that the Company is unable to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis may harm its stock price. 
Delays or disruptions in implementing new technological and management systems could impair the Company&#8217;s ability to operate and adversely affect its business. 
The Company is currently in the process of transitioning to a new software system for managing ship operations. In addition, from time to time the Company will implement or upgrade certain other technological resources utilized in running its business. The Company could be adversely affected if the new software system it is implementing for managing ship operations or other new or upgraded technological systems are defective, not installed properly, fail to perform as marketed or are not properly integrated into existing operations. In addition, the implementation of a new system may not result in improvements that outweigh the cost of implementation. System implementation failures could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial position, and ability to operate in a complex industry. 
We may be adversely affected by changes in U.S. tax laws. 
The U.S. Congress has recently passed corporate income tax reforms from which the Company has received a benefit. See Note 12, &#8220;Taxes,&#8221; for additional information. The Company is in an overall deferred tax liability position, however it has significant deferred tax assets consisting primarily of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards that are expected to be realized over an extended number of years. Although the reduction in the corporate income tax rate as of January 1, 2018 will reduce the amount of taxes we would pay in the future, a reduction in the corporate income tax rate also results in a decrease in the value of our net operating loss carryforwards. The re-measurement of the net deferred tax liability results in an increase to our net income and total equity during 2017, as discussed further in Note 12, &#8220;Taxes&#8221;. We also currently benefit from the deduction of interest expense on our indebtedness. Any elimination or modification of that deduction would increase our cash taxes payable, reducing our future cash available for operations and dividend payments. 
Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters 
The Company&#8217;s business would be adversely affected if it failed to comply with the Jones Act&#8217;s limitations on U.S. coastwise trade, or if these limitations were waived, modified or repealed, or if changes in international trade agreements were to occur. 
Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s operations are conducted in the U.S. coastwise trade and are governed by U.S. federal laws commonly known as the &#8220;Jones Act&#8221;. The Jones Act restricts waterborne transportation of goods between points in the United States to vessels meeting certain requirements, including ownership and control by &#8220;U.S. Citizens&#8221; as defined thereunder. The Company is responsible for monitoring the foreign ownership of its common stock and other interests to ensure compliance with the Jones Act. The Company could lose the privilege of owning and operating vessels in the Jones Act trade if non-U.S. Citizens were to own or control, in the aggregate, more than 25% of the equity interests in the Company. Such loss would have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business and results of operations. In addition, under certain circumstances failure to comply with the Jones Act may result in the Company being deemed to have violated other U.S. federal laws that prohibit a foreign transfer of U.S. documented vessels without government approval, resulting in severe penalties, including permanent loss of U.S. coastwise trading privileges or forfeiture of the vessels deemed transferred, and fines. 
Additionally, maritime transportation services are currently excluded from the General Agreement on Trade in Services (&#8220;GATS&#8221;) and are the subject of reservations by the United States in the North American Free Trade Agreement (&#8220;NAFTA&#8221;) and other international free trade agreements. If maritime transportation services were included in GATS, NAFTA or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise repealed or altered, the transportation of maritime cargo between U.S. ports could be opened to international flag or foreign built vessels. During the past several years, particularly with regard to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Irma, interest groups have lobbied Congress, and legislation has been introduced, to repeal certain provisions of the Jones Act to facilitate international flag competition for trades and cargoes currently reserved for U.S. Flag vessels under the Jones Act. The Company expects that continued efforts will be made to modify or repeal the Jones Act. Because international vessels may have lower construction costs, wage rates and operating costs, this could significantly increase competition in the coastwise trade, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
The U.S. government could requisition the Company&#8217;s vessels during a period of war or emergency, which may negatively impact the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and available cash. 
The U.S. government could requisition one or more of the Company&#8217;s vessels for title or hire, typically occurring during a period of war or emergency. Requisition for title or hire occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and becomes the owner or the charterer at dictated charter rates. Two OSG vessels participate in the U.S. Maritime Security Program, which ensures that militarily useful U.S. Flag vessels are available to the U.S. Department of Defense in the event of war or national emergency. Under the program, OSG receives an annual fee, subject in each case to annual Congressional appropriations, in exchange for a guarantee that the ships will be made available to the U.S. government in the time of war or national emergency. The U.S. government requisition of one or more of the Company&#8217;s vessels may negatively impact the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and available cash. 
Compliance with complex laws, regulations, and, in particular, environmental laws or regulations may adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business. 
The Company&#8217;s operations are affected by extensive and changing international, national and local environmental protection laws, regulations, treaties, conventions and standards. These requirements are designed to reduce the risk of oil spills and water pollution and to regulate air emissions, including emission of greenhouse gases. These requirements impose significant capital and operating costs on OSG, including those related to engine adjustments and ballast water treatment. 
Environmental laws and regulations also can affect the resale value or significantly reduce the useful lives of the Company&#8217;s vessels, require a reduction in carrying capacity, ship modifications or operational changes or restrictions (and related increased operating costs) or retirement of service, lead to decreased availability or higher cost of insurance coverage for environmental matters or result in the denial of access to, or detention in, certain jurisdictional waters or ports. Under local, national and foreign laws, as well as international treaties and conventions, OSG could incur material liabilities, including cleanup obligations, in the event that there is a release of petroleum or other hazardous substances from its vessels or otherwise in connection with its operations. OSG could be subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to the release of or exposure to hazardous materials associated with its current or historic operations. Violations of or liabilities under environmental requirements also can result in substantial penalties, fines and other sanctions, including in certain instances, seizure or detention of the Company&#8217;s vessels. 
OSG could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs, fines, penalties, third-party claims and natural resource damages, as the result of an oil spill or liabilities under environmental laws. The Company is subject to the oversight of several government agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Maritime Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation. OPA 90 affects all vessel owners shipping oil or hazardous material to, from or within the United States. OPA 90 allows for potentially unlimited liability without regard to fault for owners, operators and bareboat charterers of vessels for oil pollution in U.S. waters. Similarly, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, as amended, which has been adopted by most countries outside of the United States, imposes liability for oil pollution in international waters. OPA 90 expressly permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to hazardous materials and oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries. Coastal states in the United States have enacted pollution prevention liability and response laws, many providing for unlimited liability. 
In order to comply with laws and regulations, shipowners likely will incur substantial additional capital and/or operating expenditures to meet new regulatory requirements, to develop contingency arrangements for potential spills and to obtain insurance coverage. Key regulatory initiatives that are anticipated to require substantial additional capital and/or operating expenditures in the next several years include more stringent limits on the sulfur content of fuel oil for vessels operating in waters not already considered emissions control areas and more stringent requirements for management and treatment of ballast water. 
The Company expects to install ballast water treatment systems on its vessels at substantial capital cost and incur increased operating expenses between 2019 and 2023. Although the Company has performed due diligence in choosing the particular systems, there is no assurance that the technologies chosen will perform as expected or be installed without delays. 
The Company continues to be in full compliance with the USCG&#8217;s phase-in schedule for ballast water treatment systems and has received from the USCG for six vessels. The EPA determined in 2013 that it will not issue extensions under the VGP but stated that vessels that meet certain conditions, including having received the USCG extensions, would be a &#8220;low enforcement priority&#8221;. While the six vessels with USCG extensions are not in compliance with the EPA&#8217;s phase-in schedule, OSG believes that its vessels will meet the conditions for a low enforcement priority.&#8221; However, no assurance is given that EPA will not 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
change their position. If the EPA determines to enforce the limits for such vessels, such action could have a material adverse effect on OSG. See Item 1, &#8220;Business - Environmental and Security Matters Relating to Bulk Shipping.&#8221; 
Other government regulation of vessels, particularly in the areas of safety and environmental requirements, can be expected to become stricter in the future and require the Company to incur significant capital expenditures on its vessels to keep them in compliance, or even to scrap or sell certain vessels altogether. Such expenditures could result in financial and operational impacts that may be material to OSG&#8217;s financial statements. Additionally, the failure of a shipowner or bareboat charterer to comply with local, domestic and foreign regulations may subject it to increased liability, may invalidate existing insurance or decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports. If any of our vessels are denied access to, or are detained in, certain ports, reputation, business, financial results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. 
Incidents involving highly publicized oil spills and other mishaps involving vessels can be expected in the tanker industry, and such events could be expected to result in the adoption of even stricter laws and regulations, which could limit the Company&#8217;s operations or its ability to do business and which could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial results and cash flows. In addition, the Company is required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain certain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to its operations. The Company believes its vessels are maintained in good condition in compliance with present regulatory requirements, are operated in compliance with applicable safety and environmental laws and regulations and are insured against usual risks for such amounts as the Company&#8217;s management deems appropriate. The vessels&#8217; operating certificates and licenses are renewed periodically during each vessel&#8217;s required annual survey. However, government regulation of tankers, particularly in the areas of safety and environmental impact, may change in the future and require the Company to incur significant capital expenditures with respect to its ships to keep them in compliance. 
Due to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries, including the United States, and international organizations, including the IMO and the European Union, have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These regulatory measures include, among others, adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. Such actions could result in significant financial and operational impacts on the Company&#8217;s business, including requiring OSG to install new emission controls, acquire allowances or pay taxes related to its greenhouse gas emissions, or administer and manage a greenhouse gas emission program. The Company is calculating and reporting greenhouse gas emissions on voyages to and from EU ports under the EU&#8217;s Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) scheme, and that requirement could be expanded to all vessels worldwide on any voyage under a similar IMO program currently under development. See Item 1, &#8220;Business - Environmental and Security Matters Relating to Bulk Shipping.&#8221; In addition to the added costs, the concern over climate change and regulatory measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may reduce global demand for oil and oil products, which would have an adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial results and cash flows. 
The employment of the Company&#8217;s vessels could be adversely affected by an inability to clear the oil majors&#8217; risk assessment process. 
Our industry is heavily regulated. In addition, the major oil companies have developed a strict due diligence process for selecting their shipping partners out of concerns for the environmental impact of spills. This vetting process has evolved into a sophisticated and comprehensive risk assessment of both the vessel manager and the vessel. The Company&#8217;s charterers require that the Company&#8217;s vessels and the technical managers pass vetting inspections and management audits. The Company&#8217;s failure to maintain any of its vessels to these standards could put the Company in breach of the applicable charter agreement and lead to termination of such agreement thereby adversely affecting the revenues of the Company 
The Company may be subject to litigation and government inquiries or investigations that, if not resolved in the Company&#8217;s favor and not sufficiently covered by insurance, could have a material adverse effect on it. 
The Company has been and is, from time to time, involved in various litigation matters and is subject to government inquiries and investigations. These matters may include, among other things, contract disputes, personal injury claims, environmental claims or proceedings, asbestos and other toxic tort claims, employment matters, governmental claims for taxes or duties, and other disputes that arise in the ordinary course of the Company&#8217;s business. The Company believes it has sufficient insurance coverage for the majority, though not all, of these cases. 
Although the Company intends to defend these matters vigorously, it cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any such matter, and the ultimate outcome of these matters or the potential costs to resolve them could involve or result in significant expenditures or losses by the Company, or result in significant changes to OSG&#8217;s rules and practices in dealing with 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
its customers, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s future operating results. Insurance may not be applicable or sufficient in all cases. Because litigation is inherently uncertain, the Company&#8217;s estimates for contingent liabilities may be insufficient to cover the actual liabilities from such claims, resulting in a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See Item 3, &#8220;Legal Proceedings,&#8221; and Note 21, &#8220;Contingencies,&#8221; to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statement and Supplementary Data.&#8221; 
Maritime claimants could arrest OSG&#8217;s vessels, which could interrupt cash flows. 
Crew members, suppliers of goods and services to a vessel, shippers of cargo and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against that vessel for unsatisfied debts, claims or damages. In many jurisdictions, a maritime lien holder may enforce its lien by arresting a vessel through foreclosure proceedings. The arrest or attachment of one or more of the Company&#8217;s vessels could interrupt OSG&#8217;s cash flow and require it to pay a significant amount of money to have the arrest lifted. Claimants could try to assert &#8220;sister ship&#8221; liability against one vessel in the Company&#8217;s fleet for claims relating to another vessel in its fleet which, if successful, could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
The Company&#8217;s U.S. federal income tax position in respect of certain credit agreement borrowings used by INSW is not free from doubt. 
The Company has taken the position that certain drawdowns by the Company under the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility used solely by INSW should not be taken into account in determining amounts includible in OSG&#8217;s income as deemed dividends under section 951(a)(1)(B) and section 956 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for taxable years 2013 and earlier. The Company has established a reserve in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 740. If the IRS were to challenge the Company&#8217;s position, the Company&#8217;s total cash exposure could exceed the reserve, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Transfers or issuances of the Company&#8217;s equity may impair or reduce the Company&#8217;s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes in the future. 
Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, contain rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an &#8220;ownership change&#8221; to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change. An &#8220;ownership change&#8221; is generally defined as any change in ownership of more than 50% of a corporation&#8217;s stock over a rolling three-year period by stockholders that own (directly or indirectly) 5% or more of the stock of a corporation, or arising from a new issuance of stock by a corporation. If an ownership change occurs, Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the use of pre-ownership change NOLs, credits and certain other tax attributes to offset taxable income earned after the ownership change. The annual limitation is equal to the product of the applicable long-term tax exempt rate and the value of the company&#8217;s stock immediately before the ownership change. This annual limitation may be adjusted to reflect any unused annual limitation for prior years and certain recognized built-in gains and losses for the year. In addition, Section 383 generally limits the amount of tax liability in any post-ownership change year that can be reduced by pre-ownership change tax credit carryforwards. If the Company were to undergo an &#8220;ownership change,&#8221; it could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Risks Related to the Common Stock and Warrants 
The market price of the Company&#8217;s securities fluctuates significantly . 
The market price of the Company&#8217;s securities fluctuates substantially. You may not be able to resell your Class A common stock or Class A warrants at or above the price you paid for such securities due to a number of factors, some of which are beyond the Company&#8217;s control, including the occurrence of the risks described herein. The falling price of the Company&#8217;s equity securities may expose the Company to securities class action litigation, which could result in substantial cost and the diversion of management&#8217;s attention and resources. 
The ability to sell warrants may be limited and the exercise of outstanding warrants may result in substantial dilution to the Company&#8217;s stockholders. 
The Company&#8217;s Class A warrants are currently traded as &#8220;restricted securities&#8221; in the over-the-counter market and in privately negotiated transactions among individual holders pursuant to exemptions from the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
Transactions are reported as taking place only sporadically. The liquidity of any market that may develop for the Class A warrants, the ability to sell the Class A warrants and the price at which such securities would sell are all uncertain. 
The Company has outstanding Class A warrants with an exercise price of $0.01 per share exercisable into shares of Class A common stock. If exercised, the shares of Class A common stock underlying these warrants would represent approximately 19% of the Company&#8217;s outstanding Class A common stock. Accordingly, any such exercise may result in substantial dilution to the Company&#8217;s stockholders. 
The Company&#8217;s common stock is subject to restrictions on foreign ownership, which could have a negative impact on the transferability of the Company&#8217;s common stock, its liquidity and market value, and on a change of control of the Company. 
The Company&#8217;s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws authorize its Board of Directors to establish certain rules, policies and procedures, including procedures with respect to transfer of shares, to assist in monitoring and maintaining compliance with the Jones Act ownership restrictions. In order to provide a reasonable margin for compliance with the Jones Act at least 77% (the &#8220;Minimum Percentage&#8221;) of the outstanding shares of each class of capital stock of the Company must be owned by U.S. citizens. Moreover, any purported transfer of equity interests in the Company that caused the percentage of outstanding shares of a class of capital stock of the Company to fall below the Minimum Percentage will be rendered ineffective to transfer the equity interests or any voting, dividend or other rights associated with such interests. 
The percentage of U.S. citizenship ownership of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common stock fluctuates based on daily trading, and at times in the past, has declined to the Minimum Percentage. At and during such time that the Minimum Percentage is reached, the Company is unable to issue any further shares of such class of common stock or approve transfers of such class of common stock to non-U.S. citizens. The existence and enforcement of these ownership restrictions could have an adverse impact on the liquidity or market value of the Company&#8217;s equity securities. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, the ownership restrictions could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of the Company. 
The Company&#8217;s outstanding warrants are not subject to the above ownership restrictions, but the warrants include provisions limiting the right of non-U.S. citizens to exercise warrants if the shares of common stock that would be issued upon exercise would cause the percentage of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common stock held by U.S. citizens to decline below the Minimum Percentage. 
OSG is a holding company and depends on the ability of its subsidiaries to distribute funds to it in order to satisfy its financial obligations or pay dividends. 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. is a holding company and its subsidiaries conduct all of its operations and own all of its operating assets. It has no significant assets other than the equity interests in its subsidiaries. As a result, its ability to satisfy its financial obligations or pay dividends is dependent on the ability of its subsidiaries to distribute funds to it. In addition, the &#32; terms of the OBS Term Loan and the ABL Facility restrict the ability of OBS and its subsidiaries to distribute funds to Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
Some provisions of Delaware law and the Company&#8217;s governing documents could influence its ability to effect a change of control. 
Certain provisions of Delaware law and contained in the Company&#8217;s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of the Company. In addition, these provisions could make it more difficult to bring about a change in the composition of the Company&#8217;s board of directors. For example, the Company&#8217;s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws: 
give the sole ability to then-current members of its board of directors to fill a vacancy on the board of directors; 
require the affirmative vote of two-thirds or more of the combined voting power of the outstanding shares of its capital stock in order to amend or repeal certain provisions of its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws; and 
establish advance notice requirements for nomination for elections to its board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. 
Separately, the Company has elected to opt out of Section 203 (&#8220;Section 203&#8221;) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the &#8220;DGCL&#8221;), which restricts certain business combinations between a Delaware corporation and an &#8220;interested stockholder.&#8221; 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
Accordingly, the Company will be able to enter into such transactions with its principal stockholders without complying with the requirements of Section 203. The election to opt out of Section 203 could deprive certain stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of the Company, particularly if it enters into a transaction with an &#8220;interested stockholder.&#8221; 
Securities analysts may not initiate coverage or continue to cover the Company&#8217;s securities, and this may have a negative impact on their market price. 
The trading market for the Company&#8217;s securities will depend in part on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about the Company and its business. The Company does not have any control over securities analysts and they may not initiate coverage or continue to cover the Company&#8217;s securities. If securities analysts do not cover the Company&#8217;s securities, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect their market price. If the Company is covered by securities analysts, and the Company&#8217;s securities are the subject of an unfavorable report, the Company&#8217;s securities prices would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover the Company or fails to publish regular reports on the Company, the Company could lose visibility in the financial markets, which may cause the price or trading volume of the Company&#8217;s securities to decline.

The following important risk factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements made in this report or presented elsewhere by management from time to time. If any of the circumstances or events described below actually arise or occur, the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Actual dollar amounts are used in this Item 1 A. &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section.
Risks Related to Our Industry 
The highly cyclical nature of the industry may lead to volatile changes in charter rates and vessel values, which could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s earnings and available cash. 
The tanker industry is both cyclical and volatile in terms of charter rates and profitability. Fluctuations in charter rates and vessel values result from changes in supply and demand both for tanker capacity and for oil and oil products. Factors affecting these changes in supply and demand are generally outside of the Company&#8217;s control. The nature, timing and degree of changes in industry conditions are unpredictable and could adversely affect the values of the Company&#8217;s vessels or result in significant fluctuations in the amount of charter revenues the Company earns, which could result in significant volatility in OSG&#8217;s quarterly results and cash flows. Factors influencing the demand for tanker capacity include:
Factors influencing the supply of vessel capacity include:
Many of the factors that influence the demand for tanker capacity will also, in the longer term, effectively influence the supply of tanker capacity, since decisions to build new capacity, invest in capital repairs, or to retain in service older obsolescent capacity are influenced by the general state of the marine transportation industry from time to time.
The market value of vessels fluctuates significantly, which could adversely affect OSG&#8217;s liquidity or otherwise adversely affect its financial condition. 
The market value of vessels has fluctuated over time. The fluctuation in market value of vessels over time is based upon various factors, including:
Jones Act vessel market values have, on average, generally declined over the past several years. In addition, as vessels grow older, they generally decline in value. These factors will affect the value of the Company&#8217;s vessels at the time of any vessel sale. If OSG sells a vessel at a sale price that is less than the vessel&#8217;s carrying amount on the Company&#8217;s financial statements, OSG will incur a loss on the sale and a reduction in earnings and surplus. In addition, declining values of the Company&#8217;s vessels could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s liquidity by limiting its ability to raise cash by refinancing vessels.
Declines in charter rates and other market deterioration could cause OSG to incur impairment charges. 
The Company evaluates events and changes in circumstances that have occurred to determine whether they indicate that the carrying amount of the vessel assets might not be recoverable. This review for potential impairment indicators and projection of future cash flows related to the vessels is complex and requires the Company to make various estimates, including future freight rates, earnings from the vessels, market appraisals and discount rates. All of these items have historically been volatile. The Company evaluates the recoverable amount of a vessel asset as the sum of its undiscounted estimated future cash flows. If the recoverable amount is less than the vessel&#8217;s carrying amount, the vessel&#8217;s carrying amount is then compared to its estimated fair value, which is determined using vessel appraisals or discounted estimated future cash flows. If the vessel&#8217;s carrying amount is less than its fair value, it is deemed impaired. The carrying values of the Company&#8217;s vessels may differ significantly from their fair market value. Impairment charges aggregating $104.4 million on seven of the Company&#8217;s eight rebuilt Jones Act ATBs were recorded during 2016.
An increase in the supply of vessels without a commensurate increase in demand for such vessels could cause charter rates to decline, which could adversely affect OSG&#8217;s revenues, profitability and cash flows, as well as the value of its vessels. 
The marine transportation industry has historically been highly cyclical, as the profitability and asset values of companies in the industry have fluctuated based on changes in the supply and demand of vessels. If the number of new ships of a particular class delivered exceeds the number of vessels of that class being scrapped, available capacity in that class will increase. In the U.S. domestic market, as of December 31, 2016, there were firm orders to build five tankers and four ATBs, representing approximately 10% of the existing Jones Act fleet of Product Carriers and large ATBs (defined as vessels having carrying capacities of between 0.14 million barrels and 0.35 million barrels, which excludes numerous tank barges below 0.14-million- barrel capacity and 11 much larger tankers dedicated exclusively to the Alaskan crude oil trade). Given the smaller number of tankers operating in the U.S. domestic market, even a limited increase in capacity supply may negatively impact the market and may have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s revenues, profitability and cash flows.
Shipping is a business with inherent risks, and OSG&#8217;s insurance may not be adequate to cover its losses. 
OSG&#8217;s vessels and their cargoes are at risk of being damaged or lost because of events including, but not limited to:
In addition, transporting crude oil is at risk of business interruptions due to labor strikes, port closings and boycotts. These hazards may result in death or injury to persons; loss of revenues or property; environmental damage; higher insurance rates; damage to OSG&#8217;s customer relationships; and market disruptions, delay or rerouting, which may also subject OSG to litigation. In addition, the operation of tankers has unique operational risks associated with the transportation of oil. An oil spill may cause significant environmental damage and the associated costs could exceed the insurance coverage available to the Company. Compared to other types of vessels, tankers are also exposed to a higher risk of damage and loss by fire, whether ignited by a terrorist attack, collision, or other cause, due to the high flammability and high volume of the oil transported in tankers. Furthermore, any such incident could seriously damage OSG&#8217;s reputation and cause OSG either to lose business or to be less likely to enter into new business (either because of customer concerns or changes in customer vetting processes). Any of these events could result in loss of revenues, decreased cash flows and increased costs.
While the Company carries insurance to protect against certain risks involved in the conduct of its business, risks may arise against which the Company is not adequately insured. For example, a catastrophic spill could exceed OSG&#8217;s $1 billion per vessel insurance coverage and have a material adverse effect on its operations. There are certain liability limits and standards established under OPA 90 and CERCLA that may impact our operations. See Item 1. &#8220;U.S. Environmental and Safety Regulations and Standards&#8221; above for additional information. In addition, OSG may not be able to procure adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates in the future, and OSG cannot guarantee that any particular claim will be paid by its insurers. In the past, new and stricter environmental regulations have led to higher costs for insurance covering environmental damage or pollution, and new regulations could lead to similar increases or even make this type of insurance unavailable. Furthermore, even if insurance coverage is adequate to cover the Company&#8217;s losses, OSG may not be able to timely obtain a replacement ship in the event of a loss. OSG may also be subject to calls, or premiums, in amounts based not only on its own claim records but also the claim records of all other members of the protection and indemnity associations through which OSG obtains insurance coverage for tort liability. OSG&#8217;s payment of these calls could result in significant expenses which would reduce its profits and cash flows or cause losses.
Constraints on capital availability have adversely affected the tanker industry and OSG&#8217;s business. 
Constraints on capital that have occurred during recent years have adversely affected the financial condition of certain of the Company&#8217;s customers, financial lenders and suppliers. Entities that suffer a material adverse impact on their financial condition may be unable or unwilling to comply with their contractual commitments to OSG including the refusal or inability of customers to pay charter hire to OSG or the inability or unwillingness of financial lenders to honor their commitments to lend funds. While OSG seeks to monitor the financial condition of its customers, financial lenders and suppliers, the availability and accuracy of information about the financial condition of such entities and the actions that OSG may take to reduce possible losses resulting from the failure of such entities to comply with their contractual obligations may be limited. Any such failure could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s revenues, profitability and cash flows. In addition, adverse financial conditions may inhibit these entities from entering into new commitments with OSG, which could also have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s revenues, profitability and cash flows.
The Company also faces other potential constraints on capital relating to counterparty credit risk and constraints on OSG&#8217;s ability to borrow funds. See also, &#8220;Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Company ___ The Company is subject to credit risks with respect to its counterparties on contracts and any failure by these counterparties to meet their obligations could cause the Company to suffer losses on such contracts, decreasing revenues and earnings&#8221; and &#8220; Risks Related to Our Company ___ OSG has incurred significant indebtedness which could affect its ability to finance its operations, pursue desirable business opportunities and successfully run its business in the future, all of which could affect OSG&#8217;s ability to fulfill its obligations under that indebtedness.&#8221; 
The current state of the financial markets and current economic conditions may adversely impact the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms and otherwise negatively impact the Company&#8217;s business. 
Financial markets and economic conditions have been, and continue to be, volatile. In recent years, businesses in the economy have faced tightening credit, weakening demand for goods and services, deteriorating liquidity conditions, volatile interest rates, and declining markets. There has been a general decline in the willingness of banks and other financial institutions to extend credit, particularly in the shipping industry, due to the historically volatile asset values of vessels. As the shipping industry is highly dependent on the availability of credit to finance and expand operations, companies within the shipping industry have been negatively affected by this decline.
Also, as a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets generally and the solvency of counterparties specifically, the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets has increased as many lenders have increased interest rates, enacted tighter lending standards, refused to refinance existing debt at all or on terms similar to current debt and reduced, and in some cases ceased to provide, funding to borrowers. Due to these factors, additional financing may not be available if needed and to the extent required, on acceptable terms or at all. If additional financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, the Company may be unable to meet its obligations as they come due or the Company may be unable to execute its business strategy, complete additional vessel acquisitions, or otherwise take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.
OSG conducts certain of its operations internationally, which subjects the Company to changing economic, political and governmental conditions abroad that may adversely affect its business. 
The Company conducts certain of its operations internationally, and its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected by changing economic, political and government conditions in the countries and regions where its vessels are employed.
OSG must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, anti-money laundering laws; and anti-competition regulations. Moreover, the shipping industry is generally considered to present elevated risks in these areas. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on the Company&#8217;s business operations and on the Company&#8217;s ability to transport cargo to one or more countries, and could also materially affect the Company&#8217;s brand, ability to attract and retain employees, international operations, business and operating results. Although OSG has policies and procedures designed to achieve compliance with these laws and regulations, OSG cannot be certain that its employees, contractors, joint venture partners or agents will not violate these policies and procedures. OSG&#8217;s operations may also subject its employees and agents to extortion attempts.
Changes in fuel prices may adversely affect profits. 
Fuel is a significant, if not the largest, expense in the Company&#8217;s shipping operations when vessels are under voyage charter. Accordingly, an increase in the price of fuel may adversely affect the Company&#8217;s profitability if these increases cannot be passed onto customers. The price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside the Company&#8217;s control, including geopolitical developments; supply and demand for oil and gas; actions by OPEC, and other oil and gas producers; war and unrest in oil producing countries and regions; regional production patterns; and environmental concerns. Fuel may become much more expensive in the future, which could reduce the profitability and competitiveness of the Company&#8217;s business compared to other forms of transportation.
Public health threats could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s operations and financial results. 
Public health threats and other highly communicable diseases, outbreaks of which have already occurred in various parts of the world near where OSG operates, could adversely impact the Company&#8217;s operations, the operations of the Company&#8217;s customers and the global economy, including the worldwide demand for crude oil and the level of demand for OSG&#8217;s services. Any quarantine of personnel, restrictions on travel to or from countries in which OSG operates, or inability to access certain areas could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s operations. Travel restrictions, operational problems or large-scale social unrest in any part of the world in which OSG operates, or any reduction in the demand for tanker services caused by public health threats in the future, may impact OSG&#8217;s operations and adversely affect the Company&#8217;s financial results.
Acts of piracy on ocean-going vessels could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business. 
Although the Company&#8217;s fleet operates mainly in U.S. waters, there are occasions when a vessel may be in an area where pirate attacks are a concern. The frequency of pirate attacks on seagoing vessels remains high, particularly in the western part of the Indian Ocean, off the west coast of Africa and in the South China Sea. If piracy attacks result in regions in which the Company&#8217;s vessels are deployed being characterized by insurers as &#8220;war risk&#8221; zones, as the Gulf of Aden has been, or Joint War Committee &#8220;war and strikes&#8221; listed areas, premiums payable for insurance coverage could increase significantly, and such insurance coverage may become difficult to obtain. Crew costs could also increase in such circumstances due to risks of piracy attacks.
In addition, while OSG believes the charterer remains liable for charter payments when a vessel is seized by pirates, the charterer may dispute this and withhold charter hire until the vessel is released. A charterer may also claim that a vessel seized by pirates was not &#8220;on-hire&#8221; for a certain number of days and it is therefore entitled to cancel the charter party, a claim the Company would dispute. The Company may not be adequately insured to cover losses from these incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, hijacking as a result of an act of piracy against the Company&#8217;s vessels, or an increase in the cost (or unavailability) of insurance for those vessels, could have a material adverse impact on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Such attacks may also impact the Company&#8217;s customers, which could impair their ability to make payments to the Company under its charters.
Terrorist attacks and international hostilities and instability can affect the tanker industry, which could adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business. 
Terrorist attacks, the outbreak of war, or the existence of international hostilities could damage the world economy, adversely affect the availability of and demand for crude oil and petroleum products and adversely affect both the Company&#8217;s ability to charter its vessels and the charter rates payable under any such charters. In addition, OSG operates in a sector of the economy that is likely to be adversely impacted by the effects of political instability, terrorist or other attacks, war or international hostilities. In the past, political instability has also resulted in attacks on vessels, mining of waterways and other efforts to disrupt international shipping, particularly in the Arabian Gulf region. These factors could also increase the costs to the Company of conducting its business, particularly crew, insurance and security costs, and prevent or restrict the Company from obtaining insurance coverage, all of which could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Risks Related to Our Company 
As a result of the spin-off of INSW on November 30, 2016, OSG&#8217;s historical financial information may not be a reliable indicator of OSG&#8217;s future financial results and the spin-off may adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business. 
In accordance with Accounting Standards Update 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, the assets and liabilities and results of operations of INSW are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Accordingly, all references made to financial data in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are to OSG&#8217;s continuing operations, unless specifically noted. Accordingly, the historical financial information included in this Annual Report does not necessarily reflect the financial condition, operating performance or cash flows that OSG would have achieved without INSW as a wholly owned subsidiary during the periods presented or those that OSG will achieve in the future, including as a result of the following factors: 
OSG may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the spin-off or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. The anticipated benefits may not be achieved for a variety of reasons, including among others:
If OSG fails to achieve some or all of the benefits to result from the spin-off, or if such benefits are delayed, it could have an adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s competitive position, financial condition, operating results or cash flows.
OSG has incurred significant indebtedness which could affect its ability to finance its operations, pursue desirable business opportunities and successfully run its business in the future, all of which could affect OSG&#8217;s ability to fulfill its obligations under that indebtedness. 
As of December 31, 2016, OSG had $525.1 million of outstanding indebtedness. OSG&#8217;s substantial indebtedness and interest expense could have important consequences, including:
OSG&#8217;s ability to continue to fund its obligations and to reduce debt may be affected by general economic, financial market, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, among other things. An inability to fund the Company&#8217;s debt requirements or reduce debt could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Additionally, the actual or perceived credit quality of the Company&#8217;s charterers (as well as any defaults by them) could materially affect the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain the additional capital resources that it will require to purchase additional vessels or significantly increase the costs of obtaining such capital. The Company&#8217;s inability to obtain additional financing at a higher-than-anticipated cost, or at all, could materially affect the Company&#8217;s results of operation and its ability to implement its business strategy.
The Company may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of its indebtedness, and could in the future breach covenants in its credit facilities and term loans. 
The Company&#8217;s earnings, cash flow and the market value of its vessels vary significantly over time due to the cyclical nature of the tanker industry, as well as general economic and market conditions affecting the industry. As a result, the amount of debt that OSG can manage in some periods may not be appropriate in other periods and its ability to meet the financial covenants to which it is subject or may be subject in the future may vary. Additionally, future cash flow may be insufficient to meet the Company&#8217;s debt obligations and commitments. Any insufficiency could negatively impact OSG&#8217;s business.
The OBS Term Loan and the ABL Facility contain certain restrictions relating to new borrowings and, the movement of funds between OBS and OSG, as set forth in the loan agreement. Furthermore, drawdowns under the OBS ABL Facility borrowings are limited based upon the available borrowing base, as defined in that loan agreement and, if availability falls below a certain amount for a specified period of time, the administrative agent could exercise cash dominion rights permitting it to invoke control rights over certain of our accounts. While the Company was in compliance with these requirements as of December 31, 2016, a decrease in vessel values could cause the Company to breach certain covenants its existing credit facilities and term loans, or in future financing agreements that the Company may enter into from time to time. If the Company breaches such covenants and is unable to remedy the relevant breach or obtain a waiver, the Company&#8217;s lenders could accelerate its debt and foreclose on the Company&#8217;s owned vessels.
A range of economic, competitive, financial, business, industry and other factors will affect future financial performance, and, accordingly, the Company&#8217;s ability to generate cash flow from operations and to pay debt. Many of these factors, such as charter rates, economic and financial conditions in the tanker industry and the economy or competitive initiatives of competitors, are beyond the Company&#8217;s control. If OSG does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy its debt obligations, it may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as:
Undertaking alternative financing plans, if necessary, might not allow OSG to meet its debt obligations. The Company&#8217;s ability to restructure or refinance its debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets, its access to such markets and its financial condition at that time. The 8.125% unsecured Notes will mature on March 30, 2018. To remain in compliance with the OBS ABL Facility, the Company&#8217;s current plan is to pay off or refinance the outstanding balance on its 8.125% unsecured Notes by December 29, 2017. Any refinancing of debt could be at higher interest rates and might require the Company to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict OSG&#8217;s business operations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict OSG from adopting certain alternatives. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit OSG to meet its scheduled debt service obligations. The Company&#8217;s inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its debt obligations, to meet the covenants of its credit agreements and term loans and/or to obtain alternative financing in such circumstances, could materially and adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
The Company will be required to make additional capital expenditures to expand the number of vessels in its fleet and to maintain all of its vessels, which depend on additional financing. 
The Company has not started or completed construction on any vessels during the five years ended December 31, 2016. The Company&#8217;s business strategy is based in part upon the expansion of its fleet through the purchase of additional vessels at attractive points. If OSG is unable to fulfill its obligations under any memorandum of agreement or newbuilding construction contract for future vessel acquisitions, the sellers of such vessels may be permitted to terminate such contracts and the Company may be required to forfeit all or a portion of the down payments it made under such contracts and it may also be sued for any outstanding balance. In addition, as a newbuilding vessel must be drydocked within five years of its delivery from a shipyard, with survey cycles of no more than 60 months for the first three surveys, and 30 months thereafter, not including any unexpected repairs, the Company will incur significant maintenance costs for its existing and any newly-acquired vessels. As a result, if the Company does not utilize its vessels as planned, these maintenance costs could have material adverse effects on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
OSG may not be able to renew Time Charters when they expire or enter into new Time Charters. 
OSG&#8217;s ability to renew expiring contracts or obtain new charters will depend on the prevailing market conditions at the time of renewal. As of December 31, 2016, OSG employed 16 vessels on Time Charters, with eight of those charters expiring in 2017, five expiring in 2018, one expiring in 2019, one expiring in 2020 and one expiring in 2025. The Company&#8217;s existing Time Charters may not be renewed at comparable rates or if renewed or entered into, those new contracts may be at less favorable rates. In addition, there may be a gap in employment of vessels between current charters and subsequent charters. If at a time when OSG is seeking to arrange new charters for its vessels, market participants expect that less capacity will be necessary in the future (for example, if it is expected that oil and natural gas prices will decrease in the future, which could suggest that future oil and gas production levels will decline from then-current levels), OSG may not be able to obtain charters at attractive rates or at all. If, upon expiration of the existing Time Charter, OSG is unable to obtain Time Charters or Voyage Charters at desirable rates, the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.
In the highly competitive Jones Act market, OSG may not be able to compete effectively for charters. 
The Company&#8217;s vessels are employed in a highly competitive market. Competition arises from other vessel owners, including major oil companies, which may have substantially greater resources than OSG does. Competition for the transportation of crude oil and other petroleum products depends on price, location, size, age, condition, and the acceptability of the vessel operator to the charterer. To the extent OSG enters into new geographic regions or provides new services, it may not be able to compete profitably. New markets may involve competitive factors that differ from those of the Company&#8217;s current markets, and the competitors in those markets may have greater financial strength and capital resources than OSG does.
OSG may not realize the benefits it expects from past acquisitions or acquisitions or other strategic transactions it may make in the future. 
OSG&#8217;s business strategy includes ongoing efforts to engage in material acquisitions of assets or ownership interests in entities in the tanker industry and of individual tankers. The success of OSG&#8217;s acquisitions will depend upon a number of factors, some of which may not be within its control. These factors include OSG&#8217;s ability to:
OSG intends to finance these acquisitions by using available cash from operations and through incurrence of debt or bridge financing, either of which may increase its leverage ratios, or by issuing equity, which may have a dilutive impact on its existing shareholders. At any given time, OSG may be engaged in a number of discussions that may result in one or more acquisitions, some of which may be material to OSG as a whole. These opportunities require confidentiality and may involve negotiations that require quick responses by OSG. Although there can be no certainty that any of these discussions will result in definitive agreements or the completion of any transactions, the announcement of any such transaction may lead to increased volatility in the trading price of OSG&#8217;s securities.
Acquisitions and other transactions can also involve a number of special risks and challenges, including:
The success of acquisitions or strategic investments depends on the effective integration of newly acquired businesses or assets into OSG&#8217;s current operations. Such integration is subject to risks and uncertainties, including realization of anticipated synergies and cost savings, the ability to retain and attract personnel and clients, the diversion of management&#8217;s attention from other business concerns, risk of non-compliance with internal controls over financial reporting for an acquired company, in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of the acquired company or asset. OSG may not realize the strategic and financial benefits that it expects from any of its past acquisitions, or any future acquisitions. Further, if a portion of the purchase price of a business is attributable to goodwill and if the acquired business does not perform up to expectations at the time of the acquisition some or all of the goodwill may be written off, adversely affecting OSG&#8217;s earnings. OSG has recorded material write-offs of goodwill and intangible assets in prior years related to earlier acquisitions it consummated.
Changes in demand in specialized markets in which the Company currently trades may lead the Company to redeploy certain vessels to other markets. 
The Company deploys its vessels in several specialized markets, including, without limitation, Lightering in the Delaware Bay. The Company conducts those Lightering operations with two ATBs which were constructed using funds withdrawn from the CCF. If there is lower demand in these markets, the Company may have to consider redeploying these two ATBs in other markets. If that occurs, the Company may not be able to compete profitably in the new markets, and the ATBs may not be able to be redeployed to new markets without substantial modification. In addition, we would be required to pay daily liquidated damages to MARAD if those vessels were deployed in the contiguous coastwise trades.
Operating costs and capital expenses will increase as the Company&#8217;s vessels age and may also increase due to unanticipated events relating to secondhand vessels and the consolidation of suppliers. 
In general, capital expenditures and other costs necessary for maintaining a vessel in good operating condition increase as the age of the vessel increases. As of December 31, 2016, the weighted average age of the Company&#8217;s total owned and operated fleet was 9.4 years, which is based on the vessels&#8217; year of rebuild, where applicable. Cargo insurance rates are also expected to increase with the age of a vessel, since older vessels may be less desirable to charterers. Accordingly, it is likely that the operating costs of OSG&#8217;s currently operated vessels will increase. In addition, changes in governmental regulations and compliance with Classification Society standards may restrict the type of activities in which the vessels may engage and/or may require OSG to make additional expenditures for new equipment. Every commercial tanker must pass inspection by a Classification Society authorized by the vessel&#8217;s country of registry. The Classification Society certifies that a tanker is safe and seaworthy in accordance with the applicable rule and regulations of the country of registry of the tanker and the international conventions of which that country is a number. If a Classification Society requires the Company to add equipment, OSG may be required to incur substantial costs or take its vessels out of service. Market conditions may not justify such expenditures or permit OSG to operate its older vessels profitably even if those vessels remain operational. If a vessel in OSG&#8217;s fleet does not maintain its class and/or fails any survey, it will be unemployable and unable to trade between ports. This would negatively impact the Company&#8217;s results of operation.
Furthermore, recent mergers have reduced the number of available suppliers, resulting in fewer alternatives for sourcing key supplies. With respect to certain items, OSG is generally dependent upon the original equipment manufacturer for repair and replacement of the item or its spare parts. Supplier consolidation may result in a shortage of supplies and services, thereby increasing the cost of supplies or potentially inhibiting the ability of suppliers to deliver on time. These cost increases or delays could result in downtime, and delays in the repair and maintenance of the Company&#8217;s vessels and have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
The Company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from a limited number of customers, and the loss of, or reduction in business by, any of these customers could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. 
The Company&#8217;s largest customers account for a significant portion of its revenues. The Company&#8217;s top five customers comprised approximately 59% of the Company&#8217;s revenues during 2016. The loss of, or reduction in business by, any of these customers could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition and results of operations.
The lifting of the U.S. crude oil export ban could adversely impact the Company. 
Over the last four decades, the ability of U.S. producers to export domestic crude oil has been restricted by the U.S. government. In December 2015, the U.S. government enacted the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, which, among other things, removed the restriction on the export of domestic crude oil from the United States. The removal of the crude oil export restrictions may result in a continuing decline in demand for coastwise transportation of crude oil, which may have an adverse impact on the Company.
Certain potential customers will not use vessels older than a specified age, even if they have been subsequently rebuilt. 
All of the Company&#8217;s existing ATBs with the exception of the OSG Vision/OSG 350 and the OSG Horizon/OSG 351 were originally constructed more than 25 years ago. While all of these tug-barge units were rebuilt and double-hulled since 1998 and are &#8220;in-class,&#8221; meaning the vessel has been certified by a Classification Society as being built and maintained in accordance with the rules of that Classification Society and complies with the applicable rules and regulations of the vessel&#8217;s country of registry and applicable international conventions, some potential customers have stated that they will not charter vessels that are more than 20 years old, even if they have been rebuilt. Other customers may not continue to view rebuilt vessels as suitable. With an increase in the supply of newer vessels, customers may become more selective. If more customers differentiate rebuilt vessels, time charter rates for the Company&#8217;s rebuilt ATBs will likely be adversely affected.
The Company&#8217;s significant operating leases could be replaced on less favorable terms or may not be replaced. 
The Company&#8217;s operating fleet includes ten vessels that have been chartered-in under operating leases. The significant operating leases of the Company in its various businesses expire at various points in the future and may not be replaced at all or on as favorable terms, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s future financial position, results of operations and cash flow.
The Company is subject to credit risks with respect to its counterparties on contracts, and any failure by those counterparties to meet their obligations could cause the Company to suffer losses on such contracts, decreasing revenues and earnings. 
The Company has entered into, and in the future will enter into, various contracts, including charter agreements and other agreements associated with the operation of its vessels. The Company charters its vessels to other parties, who pay the company a daily rate of hire. The Company also enters COAs and Voyage Charters. Historically, the Company has not experienced material problems collecting charter hire but the economic downturn of recent years has affected charterers more severely than the prior recessions that have occurred since the Company&#8217;s establishment more than 45 years ago. Additionally, the Company enters into derivative contracts (interest rate swaps and caps) from time to time. As a result, the Company is subject to credit risks. The ability of each of the Company&#8217;s counterparties to perform its obligations under a contract with it will depend on a number of factors that are beyond the Company&#8217;s control and may include, among other things, general economic conditions; availability of debt or equity financing; the condition of the maritime and offshore industries; the overall financial condition of the counterparty; charter rates received for specific types of vessels; and various expenses. Charterers are sensitive to the commodity markets and may be impacted by market forces affecting commodities such as oil. In addition, in depressed market conditions, the Company&#8217;s charterers and customers may no longer need a vessel that is currently under charter or contract or may be able to obtain a comparable vessel at lower rates. As a result, the Company&#8217;s customers may fail to pay charter hire or attempt to renegotiate charter rates. If the counterparties fail to meet their obligations, the Company could suffer losses on such contracts which would decrease revenues, cash flows and earnings.
The Company depends on its key personnel and may have difficulty attracting and retaining skilled employees. 
OSG&#8217;s success depends to a significant extent upon the abilities and efforts of its key personnel. The loss of the services of key personnel or the Company&#8217;s inability to attract, motivate and retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, several of the Company&#8217;s executive officers have served in their current positions for less than one year. Accordingly, the management team has not worked together as a team for a significant period of time and their focus and attention may be diverted while they familiarize themselves with OSG&#8217;s business.
Work stoppages or other labor disruptions by the unionized employees of OSG or other companies in related industries may adversely affect OSG&#8217;s operations. 
As of December 31, 2016, OSG had approximately 882 regular full-time employees, of which 632 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions. See Item 1, &#8220;Business __ Employees.&#8221; OSG could be adversely affected by actions taken by employees of OSG or other companies in related industries (including third parties providing services to OSG) against efforts by management to control labor costs, restrain wage or benefits increases or modify work practices or the failure of OSG or other companies in its industry to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements.
The Company may face unexpected drydock costs for its vessels. 
Vessels must be drydocked periodically. For example, the USCG requires the Company&#8217;s vessels to be drydocked for inspection and maintenance twice every five years. The cost of repairs and renewals required at each drydock are difficult to predict with certainty, can be substantial and the Company&#8217;s insurance does not cover these costs. In addition, vessels may have to be drydocked in the event of accidents or other unforeseen damage, and OSG&#8217;s insurance may not cover all of these costs. Vessels in drydock will generally not generate any income. Large drydocking expenses could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the time when a vessel is out of service for maintenance is determined by a number of factors including regulatory deadlines, market conditions, shipyard availability and customer requirements, and accordingly the length of time that a vessel may be off-hire may be longer than anticipated, which could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Technological innovation could reduce the Company&#8217;s charter income and the value of the Company&#8217;s vessels. 
The charter rates and the value and operational life of a vessel are determined by a number of factors including the vessel&#8217;s efficiency, operational flexibility and physical life. Efficiency includes speed, fuel economy and the ability to load and discharge cargo quickly. Flexibility includes the ability to enter harbors, utilize related docking facilities and pass through canals and straits. The length of a vessel&#8217;s physical life is related to its original design and construction, its maintenance and the impact of the stress of operations. If new tankers are built that are more efficient or more flexible or have longer physical lives than the Company&#8217;s vessels, competition from these more technologically advanced vessels could adversely affect the amount of charter payments the Company receives for its vessels once their initial charters expire and the resale value of the Company&#8217;s vessels could significantly decrease. As a result, the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.
Interruption or failure of OSG&#8217;s information technology and communications systems could impair its ability to operate and adversely affect its business. 
OSG is highly dependent on information technology systems. These dependencies include accounting, billing, disbursement, cargo booking and tracking, vessel scheduling and stowage, equipment tracking, customer service, banking, payroll and communication systems. Information technology and communication systems are subject to reliability issues, integration and compatibility concerns, and security-threatening intrusions. OSG may experience failures caused by the occurrence of a natural disaster, computer hacking or viruses or other unanticipated problems at OSG&#8217;s facilities, aboard its vessels or at third-party locations. Any failure of OSG&#8217;s or third-party systems could result in interruptions in service, reductions in its revenue and profits, damage to its reputation or liability for the release of confidential information.
Effective internal controls are necessary for the Company to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. 
The Company maintains a system of internal controls to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The process of designing and implementing effective internal controls is a continuous effort that requires the Company to anticipate and react to changes in its business and the economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy its reporting obligations as a public company.
The spin-off of INSW involved significant changes to the Company&#8217;s operations and senior management, including those with primary responsibility for maintaining the system of internal controls. The management team has not worked together as a team for a significant amount of time, and their focus and attention may be diverted while they familiarize themselves with OSG&#8217;s business and gain knowledge of the Company&#8217;s financial reporting controls.
Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase the Company&#8217;s operating costs and harm its business. Furthermore, investors&#8217; perceptions that the Company&#8217;s internal controls are inadequate or that the Company is unable to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis may harm its stock price.
Delays or disruptions in implementing new technological and management systems could impair the Company&#8217;s ability to operate and adversely affect its business. 
The Company is currently in the process of transitioning to a new software system for managing ship operations. In addition, from time to time the Company will implement or upgrade certain other technological resources utilized in running its business. The Company could be adversely affected if the new software system it is implementing for managing ship operations or other new or upgraded technological systems are defective, not installed properly, fail to perform as marketed or are not properly integrated into existing operations. In addition, the implementation of a new system may not result in improvements that outweigh the cost of implementation. System implementation failures could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial position, and ability to operate in a complex industry.
We could face significant liability if one or more multiemployer plans in which we participate is reported to have underfunded liabilities and we withdraw from participation in one or more multiemployer pension plans in which we participate. 
Certain of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries are parties to collective-bargaining agreements that require them to make contributions to three jointly managed (Company and union) multiemployer pension plans covering seagoing personnel of U.S. Flag vessels. Our required contributions to these plans could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these plans, the inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability, low interest rates, lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. Certain of these multiemployer plans are currently underfunded. Significantly underfunded pension plans are required to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their under-funding. As a result, our required contributions to these plans may increase in the future. In addition, a termination of, our voluntary withdrawal from or a mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from any underfunded multiemployer pension plan to which we contribute would require us to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of such multiemployer pension plan&#8217;s unfunded vested liabilities. See Note 17, &#8220;Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefit Plans,&#8221; to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8 for additional information. Requirements to pay increased contributions or withdrawal liabilities could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and results of operations.
We may be adversely affected by potential changes in U.S. tax laws. 
The U.S. Congress and the new Administration have indicated an interest in U.S. corporate income tax reform, with possible approaches including lowering the corporate income tax rate and disallowing any deduction for interest expense except to the extent of interest income. We had significant deferred tax assets at December 31, 2016, which consists primarily of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards that are expected to be realized over an extended number of years. Although any reduction in the corporate income tax rate would reduce the amount of taxes we would pay in the future, a reduction in the corporate income tax rate would also result in a decrease in the value of our net operating loss carryforwards and a reduction to our net income and total equity during the period in which the rate reduction is enacted. We also currently benefit from the deduction of interest expense on our indebtedness. Any elimination or modification of that deduction may increase our cash taxes payable, reducing our future cash available for operations and dividend payments.
Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters 
The Company&#8217;s business would be adversely affected if it failed to comply with the Jones Act&#8217;s limitations on U.S. coastwise trade, or if these limitations were waived, modified or repealed, or if changes in international trade agreements were to occur. 
A significant majority of the Company&#8217;s operations are conducted in the U.S. coastwise trade and are governed by U.S. federal laws commonly known as the &#8220;Jones Act&#8221;. The Jones Act restricts waterborne transportation of goods between points in the United States to vessels meeting certain requirements, including ownership and control by &#8220;U.S. Citizens&#8221; as defined thereunder. The Company is responsible for monitoring the foreign ownership of its common stock and other interests to ensure compliance with the Jones Act. The Company could lose the privilege of owning and operating vessels in the Jones Act trade if non-U.S. Citizens were to own or control, in the aggregate, more than 25% of the equity interests in the Company. Such loss would have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business and results of operations. In addition, under certain circumstances failure to comply with the Jones Act may result in the Company being deemed to have violated other U.S. federal laws that prohibit a foreign transfer of U.S. documented vessels without government approval, resulting in severe penalties, including permanent loss of U.S. coastwise trading privileges or forfeiture of the vessels deemed transferred, and fines.
Additionally, maritime transportation services are currently excluded from the General Agreement on Trade in Services (&#8220;GATS&#8221;) and are the subject of reservations by the United States in the North American Free Trade Agreement (&#8220;NAFTA&#8221;) and other international free trade agreements. If maritime transportation services were included in GATS, NAFTA or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise repealed or altered, the transportation of maritime cargo between U.S. ports could be opened to international flag or foreign built vessels. During the past several years, interest groups have lobbied Congress, and legislation has been introduced, to repeal certain provisions of the Jones Act to facilitate international flag competition for trades and cargoes currently reserved for U.S. Flag vessels under the Jones Act. The Company expects that continued efforts will be made to modify or repeal the Jones Act. Because international vessels may have lower construction costs, wage rates and operating costs, this could significantly increase competition in the coastwise trade, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
The U.S. government could requisition the Company&#8217;s vessels during a period of war or emergency, which may negatively impact the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and available cash. 
The U.S. government could requisition one or more of the Company&#8217;s vessels for title or hire. Requisition for title occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and becomes the owner. Requisition for hire occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and effectively becomes the charterer at dictated charter rates. Generally, requisitions occur during a period of war or emergency. In addition, two OSG vessels participate in the U.S. Maritime Security Program, which ensures that militarily useful U.S. Flag vessels are available to the U.S. Department of Defense in the event of war or national emergency. These vessels are required to trade outside the United States but are eligible for government-sponsored business. Under the program, OSG receives an annual fee, subject in each case to annual Congressional appropriations, in exchange for a guarantee that the ships will be made available to the U.S. government in the time of war or national emergency. The U.S. government requisition of one or more of the Company&#8217;s vessels may negatively impact the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and available cash.
Compliance with complex laws, regulations, and, in particular, environmental laws or regulations, including those relating to the emission of greenhouse gases, may adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business. 
The Company&#8217;s operations are affected by extensive and changing international, national and local environmental protection laws, regulations, treaties, conventions and standards. Many of these requirements are designed to reduce the risk of oil spills. They also regulate other water pollution issues, including discharge of ballast water and effluents and air emissions, including emission of greenhouse gases. These requirements impose significant capital and operating costs on OSG, including, without limitation, ones related to engine adjustments and ballast water treatment.
Environmental laws and regulations also can affect the resale value or significantly reduce the useful lives of the Company&#8217;s vessels, require a reduction in carrying capacity, ship modifications or operational changes or restrictions (and related increased operating costs) or retirement of service, lead to decreased availability or higher cost of insurance coverage for environmental matters or result in the denial of access to, or detention in, certain jurisdictional waters or ports. Under local, national and foreign laws, as well as international treaties and conventions, OSG could incur material liabilities, including cleanup obligations, in the event that there is a release of petroleum or other hazardous substances from its vessels or otherwise in connection with its operations. OSG could also become subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to the release of or exposure to hazardous materials associated with its current or historic operations. Violations of or liabilities under environmental requirements also can result in substantial penalties, fines and other sanctions, including in certain instances, seizure or detention of the Company&#8217;s vessels.
OSG could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs, fines, penalties, third-party claims and natural resource damages, as the result of an oil spill or liabilities under environmental laws. The Company is subject to the oversight of several government agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Maritime Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation. OPA 90 affects all vessel owners shipping oil or hazardous material to, from or within the United States. OPA 90 allows for potentially unlimited liability without regard to fault for owners, operators and bareboat charterers of vessels for oil pollution in U.S. waters. Similarly, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, as amended, which has been adopted by most countries outside of the United States, imposes liability for oil pollution in international waters. OPA 90 expressly permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to hazardous materials and oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries. Coastal states in the United States have enacted pollution prevention liability and response laws, many providing for unlimited liability.
In addition, in complying with OPA 90, IMO regulations and other existing laws and regulations and those that may be adopted, shipowners likely will incur substantial additional capital and/or operating expenditures in meeting new regulatory requirements, in developing contingency arrangements for potential spills and in obtaining insurance coverage. Key regulatory initiatives that are anticipated to require substantial additional capital and/or operating expenditures in the next several years include more stringent limits on the sulfur content of fuel oil for vessels operating in certain areas and more stringent requirements for management and treatment of ballast water.
Certain of the Company&#8217;s vessels are subject to more stringent numeric discharge limits of ballast water under the EPA&#8217;s VGP, with additional vessels becoming subject in future years, even though those vessels have obtained a valid extension from the USCG for implementation of treatment technology under the USCG&#8217;s final rules. The EPA has determined that it will not issue extensions under the VGP but has stated that vessels that (i) have received an extension from the USCG (ii) are in compliance with all of the VGP requirements other than numeric discharge limits and (iii) meet certain other requirements will be entitled to &#8220;low enforcement priority&#8221;. While OSG believes that any vessel that is or may become subject to the more stringent numeric discharge limits of ballast water meets the conditions for &#8220;low enforcement priority,&#8221; no assurance can be given that they will do so. If the EPA determines to enforce the limits for such vessels, such action could have a material adverse effect on OSG. See Item 1, &#8220;Business ___ Environmental and Security Matters Relating to Bulk Shipping.&#8221;
Other government regulation of vessels, particularly in the areas of safety and environmental requirements, can be expected to become stricter in the future and require the Company to incur significant capital expenditures on its vessels to keep them in compliance, or even to scrap or sell certain vessels altogether. Such expenditures could result in financial and operational impacts that may be material to OSG&#8217;s financial statements. Additionally, the failure of a shipowner or bareboat charterer to comply with local, domestic and foreign regulations may subject it to increased liability, may invalidate existing insurance or decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports. If any of our vessels are denied access to, or are detained in, certain ports, reputation, business, financial results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.
Accidents involving highly publicized oil spills and other mishaps involving vessels can be expected in the tanker industry, and such accidents or other events could be expected to result in the adoption of even stricter laws and regulations, which could limit the Company&#8217;s operations or its ability to do business and which could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial results and cash flows. In addition, the Company is required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain certain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to its operations. The Company believes its vessels are maintained in good condition in compliance with present regulatory requirements, are operated in compliance with applicable safety and environmental laws and regulations and are insured against usual risks for such amounts as the Company&#8217;s management deems appropriate. The vessels&#8217; operating certificates and licenses are renewed periodically during each vessel&#8217;s required annual survey. However, government regulation of tankers, particularly in the areas of safety and environmental impact may change in the future and require the Company to incur significant capital expenditures with respect to its ships to keep them in compliance.
Due to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries, including the United States, and international organizations, including the IMO and the UN, have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These regulatory measures include, among others, adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. Such actions could result in significant financial and operational impacts on the Company&#8217;s business, including requiring OSG to install new emission controls, acquire allowances or pay taxes related to its greenhouse gas emissions, or administer and manage a greenhouse gas emission program. See Item 1, &#8220;Business ___ Environmental and Security Matters Relating to Bulk Shipping.&#8221; In addition to the added costs, the concern over climate change and regulatory measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may reduce global demand for oil and oil products, which would have an adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial results and cash flows.
The employment of the Company&#8217;s vessels could be adversely affected by an inability to clear the oil majors&#8217; risk assessment process. 
The shipping industry, and especially vessels that transport crude oil and refined petroleum products, is heavily regulated. In addition, the &#8220;oil majors&#8221; such as BP, Chevron Corporation, ConocoPhillips Company, Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell, and Total S.A. have developed a strict due diligence process for selecting their shipping partners out of concerns for the environmental impact of spills. This vetting process has evolved into a sophisticated and comprehensive risk assessment of both the vessel manager and the vessel, including audits of the management office and physical inspections of the ship. Under the terms of the Company&#8217;s charter agreements, the Company&#8217;s charterers require that the Company&#8217;s vessels and the technical managers pass vetting inspections and management audits respectively. The Company&#8217;s failure to maintain any of its vessels to the standards required by the oil majors could put the Company in breach of the applicable charter agreement and lead to termination of such agreement. Should the Company not be able to successfully clear the oil majors&#8217; risk assessment processes on an ongoing basis, the future employment of the Company&#8217;s vessels could be adversely affected since it might lead to the oil majors&#8217; terminating existing charters.
The Company may be subject to litigation and government inquiries or investigations that, if not resolved in the Company&#8217;s favor and not sufficiently covered by insurance, could have a material adverse effect on it. 
The Company has been and is, from time to time, involved in various litigation matters and subject to government inquiries and investigations. These matters may include, among other things, contract disputes, personal injury claims, environmental claims or proceedings, asbestos and other toxic tort claims, employment matters, governmental claims for taxes or duties, and other disputes that arise in the ordinary course of the Company&#8217;s business.
Additionally, there are a number of pending lawsuits alleging injuries related to purported asbestos exposure in various state and federal courts. The Company believes it has insurance coverage for the majority, though not all, of these cases.
Although the Company intends to defend these matters vigorously, it cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any such matter, and the ultimate outcome of these matters or the potential costs to resolve them could involve or result in significant expenditures or losses by the Company, or result in significant changes to OSG&#8217;s rules and practices in dealing with its customers, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s future operating results, including profitability, cash flows, and financial condition. Insurance may not be applicable or sufficient in all cases and/or insurers may not remain solvent which may have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s financial condition. The Company&#8217;s recorded liabilities and estimates of reasonably possible losses for its contingent liabilities are based on its assessment of potential liability using the information available to the Company at the time and, as applicable, any past experience and trends with respect to similar matters. However, because litigation is inherently uncertain, the Company&#8217;s estimates for contingent liabilities may be insufficient to cover the actual liabilities from such claims, resulting in a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See Item 3, &#8220;Legal Proceedings,&#8221; and Note 21, &#8220;Contingencies,&#8221; to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statement and Supplementary Data.&#8221;
The smuggling of drugs or other contraband onto the Company&#8217;s vessels may lead to governmental claims against the Company. 
The Company expects that its vessels will call in ports where smugglers attempt to hide drugs and other contraband on vessels, with or without the knowledge of crew members. To the extent the Company&#8217;s vessels are found with contraband, whether inside or attached to the hull of our vessel and whether with or without the knowledge of any of its crew, we may face governmental or other regulatory claims which could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Maritime claimants could arrest OSG&#8217;s vessels, which could interrupt cash flows. 
Crew members, suppliers of goods and services to a vessel, shippers of cargo and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against that vessel for unsatisfied debts, claims or damages. In many jurisdictions, a maritime lien holder may enforce its lien by arresting a vessel through foreclosure proceedings. The arrest or attachment of one or more of the Company&#8217;s vessels could interrupt OSG&#8217;s cash flow and require it to pay a significant amount of money to have the arrest lifted. Claimants could try to assert &#8220;sister ship&#8221; liability against one vessel in the Company&#8217;s fleet for claims relating to another vessel in its fleet which, if successful, could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
The Company&#8217;s U.S. federal income tax position in respect of certain credit agreement borrowings used by INSW is not free from doubt. 
The Company has taken the position that certain drawdowns by the Company under the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility used solely by INSW should not be taken into account in determining amounts includible in OSG&#8217;s income as deemed dividends under section 951(a)(1)(B) and section 956 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for taxable years 2013 and earlier. Although the Company believes that it has a strong basis for taking this position, there is no authority directly on point and the Company has established a reserve in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 740. If the IRS were to challenge the Company&#8217;s position, the Company&#8217;s total cash exposure could exceed the reserve, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Transfers or issuances of the Company&#8217;s equity may impair or reduce the Company&#8217;s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes in the future. 
Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, contain rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an &#8220;ownership change&#8221; to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change. An &#8220;ownership change&#8221; is generally defined as any change in ownership of more than 50% of a corporation&#8217;s stock over a rolling three-year period by stockholders that own (directly or indirectly) 5% or more of the stock of a corporation, or arising from a new issuance of stock by a corporation. If an ownership change occurs, Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the use of pre-ownership change NOLs, credits and certain other tax attributes to offset taxable income earned after the ownership change. The annual limitation is equal to the product of the applicable long-term tax exempt rate and the value of the company&#8217;s stock immediately before the ownership change. This annual limitation may be adjusted to reflect any unused annual limitation for prior years and certain recognized built-in gains and losses for the year. In addition, Section 383 generally limits the amount of tax liability in any post-ownership change year that can be reduced by pre-ownership change tax credit carryforwards. If the Company were to undergo an &#8220;ownership change,&#8221; it could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Risks Related to the Common Stock and Warrants 
The market price of the Company&#8217;s securities may fluctuate significantly .
The market price of the Company&#8217;s securities may fluctuate substantially. You may not be able to resell your Class A common stock or Class A warrants at or above the price you paid for such securities due to a number of factors, some of which are beyond the Company&#8217;s control. These risks include those described or referred to in this &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section and under &#8220;Forward -Looking Statements,&#8221; as well as, among other things: fluctuations in the Company&#8217;s operating results; activities of and results of operations of the Company&#8217;s competitors; changes in the Company&#8217;s relationships with the Company&#8217;s customers or the Company&#8217;s vendors; changes in business or regulatory conditions; changes in the Company&#8217;s capital structure; any announcements by the Company or its competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic alliances or joint ventures; additions or departures of key personnel; investors&#8217; general perception of the Company; failure to meet market expectations; future sales of the Company&#8217;s securities by it, directors, executives and significant stockholders; changes in domestic and international economic and political conditions; and other events or factors, including those resulting from natural disasters, war, acts of terrorism or responses to these events. Any of the foregoing factors could also cause the price of the Company&#8217;s equity securities to fall and may expose the Company to securities class action litigation. Any securities class action litigation could result in substantial cost and the diversion of management&#8217;s attention and resources.
In addition, the stock market has recently experienced volatility that, in some cases, has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the Company&#8217;s securities, regardless of its actual operating performance.
The Company&#8217;s warrants are thinly traded, and your ability to sell such securities may be limited. 
The Company&#8217;s Class A warrants are currently traded as &#8220;restricted securities&#8221; in the over-the-counter market and in privately negotiated transactions among individual holders pursuant to exemptions from the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Transactions are reported as taking place only sporadically. Certain broker-dealers report quotes for the purchase and sale of Class A warrants. The Company cannot assure you as to the liquidity of any market that may develop for the Class A warrants, your ability to sell your Class A warrants or the price at which you would be able to sell such securities.
The exercise of outstanding warrants may result in substantial dilution to the Company&#8217;s stockholders. 
As of March 3, 2017, the Company had outstanding 89,255,322 Class A warrants with an exercise price of $0.01 per share exercisable into an aggregate of 16,958,511 shares of Class A common stock. If exercised, the shares of Class A common stock underlying these warrants would represent, as of that date, approximately 19% of the Company&#8217;s outstanding Class A common stock following such exercise. Accordingly, any such exercise would result in substantial dilution to the Company&#8217;s stockholders.
The Company&#8217;s common stock is subject to restrictions on foreign ownership, which could have a negative impact on the transferability of the Company&#8217;s common stock, its liquidity and market value, and on a change of control of the Company. 
The Company&#8217;s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws authorize its Board of Directors to establish with respect to any class or series of capital stock of the Company certain rules, policies and procedures, including procedures with respect to transfer of shares, to assist in monitoring and maintaining compliance with the Jones Act ownership restrictions. In order to provide a reasonable margin for compliance with the Jones Act, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors has determined that until further action by it, at least 77% (the &#8220;Minimum Percentage&#8221;) of the outstanding shares of each class of capital stock of the Company must be owned by U.S. Citizens. Moreover, the Company&#8217;s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws provide that any purported transfer of equity interests in the Company that caused the percentage of outstanding shares of a class of capital stock of the Company to fall below the Minimum Percentage will be ineffective to transfer the equity interests or any voting, dividend or other rights associated with such interests.
The percentage of U.S. citizenship ownership of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common stock fluctuates based on daily trading, and at times in the past, including at times in 2015 and 2016, has declined to the Minimum Percentage. At and during such time that the Minimum Percentage is reached with respect to outstanding shares of a class of the Company&#8217;s stock, the Company is unable to issue any further shares of such class of common stock or approve transfers of such class of common stock to non-U.S. Citizens among other things. The existence and enforcement of these ownership restrictions could have an adverse impact on the liquidity or market value of the Company&#8217;s equity securities. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, the ownership restrictions could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of the Company.
The Company&#8217;s outstanding warrants are not subject to the above ownership restrictions, but the warrants include provisions limiting the right of non-U.S. Citizens to exercise warrants if the shares of common stock that would be issued upon exercise would cause the percentage of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common stock held by U.S. Citizens to decline below the Minimum Percentage.
The Company has a limited history of paying cash dividends on its securities. 
The Company has not paid any regular cash dividends since the third quarter of 2011. On February 29, 2016, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.08 per share of common stock paid prior to the end of March 2016. The declaration and timing of future cash dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things, our future operations and earnings, capital requirements, general financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law or the SEC and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant.
OSG is a holding company and depends on the ability of its subsidiaries to distribute funds to it in order to satisfy its financial obligations or pay dividends. 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. is a holding company and its subsidiaries conduct all of its operations and own all of its operating assets. It has no significant assets other than the equity interests in its subsidiaries. As a result, its ability to satisfy its financial obligations or pay dividends is dependent on the ability of its subsidiaries to distribute funds to it. In addition, the terms of the OBS Term Loan and the ABL Facility restrict the ability of OBS and its subsidiaries to distribute funds to Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.
Some provisions of Delaware law and the Company&#8217;s governing documents could influence its ability to effect a change of control. 
Certain provisions of Delaware law and contained in the Company&#8217;s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of the Company. In addition, these provisions could make it more difficult to bring about a change in the composition of the Company&#8217;s board of directors. For example, the Company&#8217;s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws:
These and other provisions of the Company&#8217;s organizational documents and Delaware law may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing changes of control or changes in management, even if such transactions or changes would have significant benefits for its stockholders. As a result, these provisions could limit the price some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock.
Separately, the Company has elected to opt out of Section 203 (&#8220;Section 203&#8221;) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the &#8220;DGCL&#8221;), which restricts certain business combinations between a Delaware corporation and an &#8220;interested stockholder.&#8221; Accordingly, the Company will be able to enter into such transactions with its principal stockholders without complying with the requirements of Section 203. The election to opt out of Section 203 could deprive certain stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of the Company, particularly if it enters into a transaction with an &#8220;interested stockholder.&#8221;

The following important risk factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements made in this report or presented elsewhere by management from time to time. If any of the circumstances or events described below actually arise or occur, the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Actual dollar amounts are used in this Item 1 A. &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section.
Risks Related to Our Industry 
The highly cyclical nature of the industry may lead to volatile changes in charter rates and vessel values, which could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s earnings and available cash. 
The tanker industry is both cyclical and volatile in terms of charter rates and profitability. Fluctuations in charter rates and vessel values result from changes in supply and demand both for tanker capacity and for oil and oil products. Factors affecting these changes in supply and demand are generally outside of the Company&#8217;s control. The nature, timing and degree of changes in industry conditions are unpredictable and could adversely affect the values of the Company&#8217;s vessels or result in significant fluctuations in the amount of charter revenues the Company earns, which could result in significant volatility in OSG&#8217;s quarterly results and cash flows. Factors influencing the demand for tanker capacity include:
Factors influencing the supply of vessel capacity include: 
Many of the factors that influence the demand for tanker capacity will also, in the longer term, effectively influence the supply of tanker capacity, since decisions to build new capacity, invest in capital repairs, or to retain in service older obsolescent capacity are influenced by the general state of the marine transportation industry from time to time.
The market value of vessels fluctuates significantly, which could adversely affect OSG&#8217;s liquidity or otherwise adversely affect its financial condition. 
The market value of vessels has fluctuated over time. The fluctuation in market value of vessels over time is based upon various factors, including:
Worldwide vessel market values have, on average, generally declined over the past several years. In addition, as vessels grow older, they generally decline in value. These factors will affect the value of the Company&#8217;s vessels at the time of any vessel sale. If OSG sells a vessel at a sale price that is less than the vessel&#8217;s carrying amount on the Company&#8217;s financial statements, OSG will incur a loss on the sale and a reduction in earnings and surplus. In addition, declining values of the Company&#8217;s vessels could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s liquidity by limiting its ability to raise cash by refinancing vessels.
Declines in charter rates and other market deterioration could cause OSG to incur impairment charges. 
The Company evaluates the carrying amounts of its vessels to determine if events have occurred that would require an impairment of those vessels&#8217; carrying amounts. The recoverable amount of vessels is reviewed to determine whether there have been any events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recovered. This review for potential impairment indicators and projection of future cash flows related to the vessels is complex and requires the Company to make various estimates, including future freight rates, earnings from the vessels and discount rates. All of these items have historically been volatile. The Company evaluates the recoverable amount as the higher of either fair value less costs to sell or value in use. If the recoverable amount is less than the vessel&#8217;s carrying amount of the vessel, the vessel is deemed impaired. The carrying values of the Company&#8217;s vessels may differ significantly from their fair market value.
An increase in the supply of vessels without a commensurate increase in demand for such vessels could cause charter rates to decline, which could adversely affect OSG&#8217;s revenues, profitability and cash flows, as well as the value of its vessels. 
OSG depends on short term duration or &#8220;spot&#8221;, charters, for a significant portion of its revenues, which exposes OSG to fluctuations in market conditions. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, OSG derived approximately 54%, 49% and 52%, respectively, of its TCE revenues in the spot market.
The marine transportation industry has historically been highly cyclical, as the profitability and asset values of companies in the industry have fluctuated based on changes in the supply and demand of vessels. If the number of new ships of a particular class delivered exceeds the number of vessels of that class being scrapped, available capacity in that class will increase. The newbuilding order book (representing vessels in various stages of planning or construction) equaled 19%, 13% and 12% of the existing world tanker fleet as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
In the U.S. domestic market, as of December 31, 2015, there were firm orders to build 13 tankers and seven ATBs, representing approximately 25% of the existing Jones Act fleet of Product Carriers and large ATBs (defined as vessels having carrying capacities of between 0.14 million barrels and 0.35 million barrels, which excludes numerous tank barges below 0.14 million barrel capacity and 11 much larger tankers dedicated exclusively to the Alaskan crude oil trade). Given the smaller number of tankers operating in the U.S. domestic market, even a limited increase in capacity supply may negatively impact the market.
Vessel supply is also affected by the number of vessels being used for floating storage, since vessels used for storage are not available to transport crude oil or petroleum products. Utilization of vessels for storage is affected by expectations of changes in the price of oil and petroleum products, with utilization generally increasing if prices are expected to increase more than storage costs and generally decreasing if they are not. A reduction in vessel utilization for storage will generally increase vessel supply. In 2010, for example, 81 vessels were released from storage and reentered the trading fleet. Since the 2010 release until near the end of 2014, storage on vessels at sea has been low, in part because then-current prices of crude oil have generally exceeded the future prices, a condition that allows companies to replace inventories at lower prices, which encourages the drawdown of commercial inventories. Supply has exceeded demand during the past five years, resulting in lower charter rates across the International Flag fleet. Since December 2014, current prices of crude oil have generally been below future prices, resulting in an increase in vessels used for storage. However, the duration of this trend of higher future prices cannot be predicted. If this trend ceases or reverses, the charter rates for the Company&#8217;s International Flag vessels could decrease to levels experienced from 2010-2014, which were well below historical averages. Any such development would have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s revenues, profitability and cash flows if sustained over a long period of time.
Shipping is a business with inherent risks, and OSG&#8217;s insurance may not be adequate to cover its losses. 
OSG&#8217;s vessels and their cargoes are at risk of being damaged or lost because of events including, but not limited to:
In addition, transporting crude oil creates a risk of business interruptions due to political circumstances in foreign countries, hostilities, labor strikes, port closings and boycotts. These hazards may result in death or injury to persons; loss of revenues or property; the payment of ransoms; environmental damage; higher insurance rates; damage to OSG&#8217;s customer relationships; and market disruptions, delay or rerouting, which may also subject OSG to litigation. In addition, the operation of tankers has unique operational risks associated with the transportation of oil. An oil spill may cause significant environmental damage and the associated costs could exceed the insurance coverage available to the Company. Compared to other types of vessels, tankers are also exposed to a higher risk of damage and loss by fire, whether ignited by a terrorist attack, collision, or other cause, due to the high flammability and high volume of the oil transported in tankers. Furthermore, any such incident could seriously damage OSG&#8217;s reputation and cause OSG either to lose business or to be less likely to enter into new business (either because of customer concerns or changes in customer vetting processes). Any of these events could result in loss of revenues, decreased cash flows and increased costs.
While the Company carries insurance to protect against certain risks involved in the conduct of its business, risks may arise against which the Company is not adequately insured. For example, a catastrophic spill could exceed OSG&#8217;s $1 billion per vessel insurance coverage and have a material adverse effect on its operations. In addition, OSG may not be able to procure adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates in the future, and OSG cannot guarantee that any particular claim will be paid by its insurers. In the past, new and stricter environmental regulations have led to higher costs for insurance covering environmental damage or pollution, and new regulations could lead to similar increases or even make this type of insurance unavailable. Furthermore, even if insurance coverage is adequate to cover the Company&#8217;s losses, OSG may not be able to timely obtain a replacement ship in the event of a loss. OSG may also be subject to calls, or premiums, in amounts based not only on its own claim records but also the claim records of all other members of the protection and indemnity associations through which OSG obtains insurance coverage for tort liability. OSG&#8217;s payment of these calls could result in significant expenses which would reduce its profits and cash flows or cause losses.
Constraints on capital availability have adversely affected the tanker industry and OSG&#8217;s business. 
Constraints on capital that have occurred during recent years have adversely affected the financial condition of certain of the Company&#8217;s customers, joint venture partners, financial lenders and suppliers. Entities that suffer a material adverse impact on their financial condition may be unable or unwilling to comply with their contractual commitments to OSG including the refusal or inability of customers to pay charter hire to OSG or the inability or unwillingness of joint venture partners or financial lenders to honor their commitments to contribute funds to a joint venture or lend funds. While OSG seeks to monitor the financial condition of its customers, joint venture partners, financial lenders and suppliers, the availability and accuracy of information about the financial condition of such entities and the actions that OSG may take to reduce possible losses resulting from the failure of such entities to comply with their contractual obligations may be limited. Any such failure could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s revenues, profitability and cash flows. In addition, adverse financial conditions may inhibit these entities from entering into new commitments with OSG, which could also have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s revenues, profitability and cash flows.
The Company also faces other potential constraints on capital relating to counterparty credit risk and constraints on OSG&#8217;s ability to borrow funds. See also &#8220;Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Company ___ The Company is subject to credit risks with respect to its counterparties on contracts and failure of such counterparties to meet their obligations could cause the Company to suffer losses on such contracts, decreasing revenues and earnings&#8221; and &#8220; ___ Risks Related to Our Company ___ OSG has incurred significant indebtedness which could affect its ability to finance its operations, pursue desirable business opportunities and successfully run its business in the future, all of which could affect OSG&#8217;s ability to fulfill its obligations under that indebtedness.&#8221;
The current state of the global financial markets and current economic conditions may adversely impact the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms and otherwise negatively impact the Company&#8217;s business. 
Global financial markets and economic conditions have been, and continue to be, volatile. In recent years, businesses in the global economy have faced tightening credit, weakening demand for goods and services, deteriorating international liquidity conditions, volatile interest rates, and declining markets. There has been a general decline in the willingness of banks and other financial institutions to extend credit, particularly in the shipping industry, due to the historically volatile asset values of vessels. As the shipping industry is highly dependent on the availability of credit to finance and expand operations, it has been negatively affected by this decline.
Also, as a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets generally and the solvency of counterparties specifically, the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets has increased as many lenders have increased interest rates, enacted tighter lending standards, refused to refinance existing debt at all or on terms similar to current debt and reduced, and in some cases ceased to provide, funding to borrowers. Due to these factors, additional financing may not be available if needed and to the extent required, on acceptable terms or at all. If additional financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, the Company may be unable to meet its obligations as they come due or the Company may be unable to execute its business strategy, complete additional vessel acquisitions, or otherwise take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.
OSG conducts its operations internationally, which subjects the Company to changing economic, political and governmental conditions abroad that may adversely affect its business. 
The Company conducts its operations internationally, and its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected by changing economic, political and government conditions in the countries and regions where its vessels are employed, including:
The occurrence of such events could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business. In addition, OSG&#8217;s international operations subject it to certain risks regarding taxation of foreign subsidiary income, see &#8220; ____ Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters ___ OSG&#8217;s financial condition would be materially adversely affected if the shipping income of OSG&#8217;s foreign subsidiaries becomes subject to current taxation in the United States.&#8221;
OSG must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, anti-money laundering laws; and anti-competition regulations. Moreover, the shipping industry is generally considered to present elevated risks in these areas. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on the Company&#8217;s business operations and on the Company&#8217;s ability to transport cargo to one or more countries, and could also materially affect the Company&#8217;s brand, ability to attract and retain employees, international operations, business and operating results. Although OSG has policies and procedures designed to achieve compliance with these laws and regulations, OSG cannot be certain that its employees, contractors, joint venture partners or agents will not violate these policies and procedures. OSG&#8217;s operations may also subject its employees and agents to extortion attempts.
Changes in fuel prices may adversely affect profits. 
Fuel is a significant, if not the largest, expense in the Company&#8217;s shipping operations when vessels are under voyage charter. Accordingly, an increase in the price of fuel may adversely affect the Company&#8217;s profitability if these increases cannot be passed onto customers. The price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside the Company&#8217;s control, including geopolitical developments; supply and demand for oil and gas; actions by OPEC, and other oil and gas producers; war and unrest in oil producing countries and regions; regional production patterns; and environmental concerns. Fuel may become much more expensive in the future, which could reduce the profitability and competitiveness of the Company&#8217;s business compared to other forms of transportation.
Acts of piracy on ocean-going vessels could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business. 
The frequency of pirate attacks on seagoing vessels remains high, particularly in the western part of the Indian Ocean, off the west coast of Africa and in the South China Sea. If piracy attacks result in regions in which the Company&#8217;s vessels are deployed being characterized by insurers as &#8220;war risk&#8221; zones, as the Gulf of Aden has been, or Joint War Committee &#8220;war and strikes&#8221; listed areas, premiums payable for insurance coverage could increase significantly, and such insurance coverage may become difficult to obtain. Crew costs could also increase in such circumstances due to risks of piracy attacks.
In addition, while OSG believes the charterer remains liable for charter payments when a vessel is seized by pirates, the charterer may dispute this and withhold charter hire until the vessel is released. A charterer may also claim that a vessel seized by pirates was not &#8220;on-hire&#8221; for a certain number of days and it is therefore entitled to cancel the charter party, a claim the Company would dispute. The Company may not be adequately insured to cover losses from these incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, hijacking as a result of an act of piracy against the Company&#8217;s vessels, or an increase in the cost (or unavailability) of insurance for those vessels, could have a material adverse impact on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Such attacks may also impact the Company&#8217;s customers, which could impair their ability to make payments to the Company under its charters.
Terrorist attacks and international hostilities and instability can affect the tanker industry, which could adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business. 
Terrorist attacks, the outbreak of war, or the existence of international hostilities could damage the world economy, adversely affect the availability of and demand for crude oil and petroleum products and adversely affect both the Company&#8217;s ability to charter its vessels and the charter rates payable under any such charters. In addition, OSG operates in a sector of the economy that is likely to be adversely impacted by the effects of political instability, terrorist or other attacks, war or international hostilities. In the past, political instability has also resulted in attacks on vessels, mining of waterways and other efforts to disrupt international shipping, particularly in the Arabian Gulf region. These factors could also increase the costs to the Company of conducting its business, particularly crew, insurance and security costs, and prevent or restrict the Company from obtaining insurance coverage, all of which could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Public health threats could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s operations and financial results. 
Public health threats and other highly communicable diseases, outbreaks of which have already occurred in various parts of the world near where OSG operates, could adversely impact the Company&#8217;s operations, the operations of the Company&#8217;s customers and the global economy, including the worldwide demand for crude oil and the level of demand for OSG&#8217;s services. Any quarantine of personnel, restrictions on travel to or from countries in which OSG operates, or inability to access certain areas could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s operations. Travel restrictions, operational problems or large-scale social unrest in any part of the world in which OSG operates, or any reduction in the demand for tanker services caused by public health threats in the future, may impact OSG&#8217;s operations and adversely affect the Company&#8217;s financial results.
Risks Related to Our Company 
OSG has incurred significant indebtedness which could affect its ability to finance its operations, pursue desirable business opportunities and successfully run its business in the future, all of which could affect OSG&#8217;s ability to fulfill its obligations under that indebtedness. 
As of December 31, 2015, OSG had $1.33 billion of outstanding indebtedness. OSG&#8217;s substantial indebtedness and interest expense could have important consequences, including:
OSG&#8217;s ability to continue to fund its obligations and to reduce debt may be affected by general economic, financial market, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, among other things. An inability to fund the Company&#8217;s debt requirements or reduce debt could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Additionally, the actual or perceived credit quality of the Company&#8217;s charterers (as well as any defaults by them) could materially affect the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain the additional capital resources that it will require to purchase additional vessels or significantly increase the costs of obtaining such capital. The Company&#8217;s inability to obtain additional financing at a higher-than-anticipated cost, or at all, could materially affect the Company&#8217;s results of operation and its ability to implement its business strategy.
The Company may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of its indebtedness, and could in the future breach covenants in its credit facilities and term loans. 
The Company&#8217;s earnings, cash flow and the market value of its vessels vary significantly over time due to the cyclical nature of the tanker industry, as well as general economic and market conditions affecting the industry. As a result, the amount of debt that OSG can manage in some periods may not be appropriate in other periods and its ability to meet the financial covenants to which it is subject or may be subject in the future may vary. Additionally, future cash flow may be insufficient to meet the Company&#8217;s debt obligations and commitments. Any insufficiency could negatively impact OSG&#8217;s business.
Each Exit Financing Facility contains certain restrictions relating to new borrowings and, the movement of funds between the borrowers thereunder and OSG, as set forth in the respective loan agreements. In addition, the OIN Facilities have a covenant to maintain the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Collateral Vessels (each as defined in that loan agreement) at greater than or equal to $500.0 million at the end of the each fiscal quarter. None of the other Exit Financing Facilities have financial covenants. Furthermore, drawdowns under the OBS ABL Facility borrowings are limited based upon the available borrowing base, as defined in that loan agreement and, if availability falls below a certain amount for a specified period of time, the administrative agent could exercise cash dominion rights permitting it to invoke control rights over certain of our accounts. While the Company was in compliance with these requirements as of December 31, 2015, a decrease in vessel values or a failure to meet this ratio could cause the Company to breach certain covenants in its existing credit facilities and term loans, or in future financing agreements that the Company may enter into from time to time. If the Company breaches such covenants and is unable to remedy the relevant breach or obtain a waiver, the Company&#8217;s lenders could accelerate its debt and foreclose on the Company&#8217;s owned vessels.
A range of economic, competitive, financial, business, industry and other factors will affect future financial performance, and, accordingly, the Company&#8217;s ability to generate cash flow from operations and to pay debt and to meet the financial covenants under the OIN Facilities. Many of these factors, such as charter rates, economic and financial conditions in the tanker industry and the global economy or competitive initiatives of competitors, are beyond the Company&#8217;s control. If OSG does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy its debt obligations, it may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as:
Undertaking alternative financing plans, if necessary, might not allow OSG to meet its debt obligations. The Company&#8217;s ability to restructure or refinance its debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets, its access to such markets and its financial condition at that time. Any refinancing of debt could be at higher interest rates and might require the Company to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict OSG&#8217;s business operations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict OSG from adopting some of certain alternatives. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit OSG to meet its scheduled debt service obligations. The Company&#8217;s inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its debt obligations, to meet the covenants of its credit agreements and term loans and/or to obtain alternative financing in such circumstances, could materially and adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
The Company will be required to make additional capital expenditures to expand the number of vessels in its fleet and to maintain all of its vessels, which depend on additional financing. 
The Company completed the construction of eight International Flag vessels, one U.S. Flag ATB and two U.S. Flag tug boats during the five years ended December 31, 2015. The Company&#8217;s business strategy is based in part upon the expansion of its fleet through the purchase of additional vessels at attractive points. If OSG is unable to fulfill its obligations under any memorandum of agreement or newbuilding construction contract for future vessel acquisitions, the sellers of such vessels may be permitted to terminate such contracts and the Company may be required to forfeit all or a portion of the down payments it made under such contracts and it may also be sued for any outstanding balance. In addition, as a newbuilding vessel must be drydocked within five years of its delivery from a shipyard, with survey cycles of no more than 60 months for the first three surveys, and 30 months thereafter, not including any unexpected repairs, the Company will incur significant maintenance costs for its existing and any newly-acquired vessels. As a result, if the Company does not utilize its vessels as planned, these maintenance costs could have material adverse effects on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
The Company depends on third party service providers for technical and commercial management of its International Flag fleet. 
The Company currently outsources to third party service providers certain management services of its International Flag fleet, including technical management, certain aspects of commercial management and crew management. In particular, the Company has entered into ship management agreements with V.Ships that assign technical management responsibilities to V.Ships for each vessel in the Company&#8217;s owned or bareboat chartered-in International Flag conventional tanker fleet (collectively, the &#8220;Ship Management Agreements&#8221;). The Company has also transferred commercial management of its International Flag conventional tanker fleet to certain other third party service providers, principally Commercial Pools.
In such outsourcing arrangements, the Company has transferred direct control over technical and commercial management of the relevant vessels, while maintaining significant oversight and audit rights, and must rely on third party service providers to, among other things:
The failure of third-party service providers to meet such commitments could lead to legal liability or other damages to the Company. The third-party service providers the Company has selected may not provide a standard of service comparable to that the Company provided for such vessels prior to any outsourcing. The Company relies on its third-party service providers to comply with applicable law, and a failure by such providers to comply with such laws may subject the Company to liability or damage its reputation even if the Company did not engage in the conduct itself. Furthermore, damage to any such third party&#8217;s reputation, relationships or business may reflect on the Company directly or indirectly, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s reputation and business.
V.Ships has the right to terminate the Ship Management Agreements at any time with 90 days&#8217; notice. If V.Ships exercises that right, the Company will be required either to enter into substitute agreements with other third parties or to assume those management duties. The Company may not succeed in negotiating and entering into such agreements with other third parties and, even if it does so, the terms and conditions of such agreements may be less favorable to the Company. Furthermore, if the Company is required to dedicate internal resources to managing the International Flag conventional tanker fleet (including, but not limited to, hiring additional qualified personnel or diverting existing resources), that could result in increased costs and reduced efficiency and profitability. Any such changes could disrupt the Company&#8217;s business and have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition.
The contribution of the Company&#8217;s joint ventures to its profits and losses may fluctuate, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. 
The Company currently owns an interest in six of its vessels through two joint ventures, one in which the Company has a 50% ownership interest and the second in which the Company has a 49.9% ownership interest, together with other third-party vessel owners and operators in the Company&#8217;s industry. See Item 1, &#8220;Business ___ Fleet Operations.&#8221; The Company&#8217;s ownership in these joint ventures is accounted for using the equity method, which means that the Company&#8217;s allocation of profits and losses of the applicable joint venture is included in its consolidated financial statements. The contribution of the Company&#8217;s joint ventures to the Company&#8217;s profits and losses may fluctuate, including the distributions that it may receive from such entities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
A joint venture involves certain risks such as:
In addition, the charters under which OSG&#8217;s two FSO joint venture vessels currently operate expire in 2017 and may not be renewed or may not be renewed at comparable rates. The carrying amount of the Company&#8217;s investment in and advances to the FSO joint venture was $269,727 as of December 31, 2015. If events relating to any of these risks were to come to pass, that could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s participation in the relevant joint venture, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
OSG&#8217;s business depends on Voyage charters, and any future decrease in spot charter rates could adversely affect its earnings. 
Voyage Charters, including vessels operating in Commercial Pools that predominantly operate in the spot market, constituted 54% of OSG&#8217;s aggregate TCE revenues in 2015, 49% in 2014 and 52% in 2013. Accordingly, OSG&#8217;s shipping revenues are significantly affected by prevailing spot rates for Voyage Charters in the markets in which the Company&#8217;s vessels operate. The spot charter market may fluctuate significantly from time to time based upon tanker and oil supply and demand. For example, over the past five years, VLCC spot market rates (expressed as a time charter equivalent) have ranged from a high of $115,780 per day to negative values, and in December 2015 were $101,923 per day on the benchmark route between the Middle East Gulf and Japan. The successful operation of OSG&#8217;s vessels in the competitive spot charter market depends on, among other things, obtaining profitable spot charters and minimizing, to the extent possible, time spent waiting for charters and time spent traveling unladen to pick up cargo. The spot market is very volatile, and, in the past, there have been periods when spot charter rates have declined below the operating cost of vessels. If spot charter rates decline in the future, then OSG may be unable to operate its vessels trading in the spot market profitably, or meet its other obligations, including payments on indebtedness. Furthermore, as charter rates for spot charters are fixed for a single voyage, which may last up to several weeks during periods in which spot charter rates are rising or falling, OSG will generally experience delays in realizing the benefits from, or experiencing the detriments of those changes. See also Item 1, &#8220;Business-Operations-Charter Types.&#8221;
OSG may not be able to renew Time Charters when they expire or enter into new Time Charters. 
OSG&#8217;s ability to renew expiring contracts or obtain new charters will depend on the prevailing market conditions at the time of renewal. As of December 31, 2015, OSG employed 28 vessels on Time Charters, with 11 of those charters expiring in 2016, 10 expiring in 2017, five expiring in 2018, one expiring in 2020 and one expiring in 2025. The Company&#8217;s existing Time Charters may not be renewed at comparable rates or if renewed or entered into, those new contracts may be at less favorable rates. In addition, there may be a gap in employment of vessels between current charters and subsequent charters. If at a time when OSG is seeking to arrange new charters for its vessels, market participants expect that less capacity will be necessary in the future (for example, if it is expected that oil and natural gas prices will decrease in the future, which could suggest that future oil and gas production levels will decline from then-current levels), OSG may not be able to obtain charters at attractive rates or at all. If, upon expiration of the existing Time Charter, OSG is unable to obtain Time Charters or Voyage Charters at desirable rates, the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.
Termination of, or a change in the nature of, OSG&#8217;s relationship with any of the Commercial Pools in which it participates could adversely affect its business. 
As of December 31, 2015, six of the Company&#8217;s eight VLCCs participate in the TI pool; all seven Aframaxes participate in the SIGMA pool; four of the Company&#8217;s eight crude Panamaxes and one of its four Panamax Product Carriers participate directly in the PI pool; its only LR2 participates in the Navig8 pool; 14 of its MRs participate in the CPTA pool; and five of its MRs participate in the HDT pool (an aggregate of 19 MRs out of a total of 20). OSG&#8217;s participation in these pools is intended to enhance the financial performance of the Company&#8217;s vessels through higher vessel utilization. Any participant in any of these pools has the right to withdraw upon notice in accordance with the relevant pool agreement. Changes in the management of, and the terms of, these pools, decreases in the number of vessels participating in these pools, or the termination of these pools, could result in increased costs and reduced efficiency and profitability for the Company.
In addition, in recent years the EU has published guidelines on the application of the EU antitrust rules to traditional agreements for maritime services such as Commercial Pools. While the Company believes that all the Commercial Pools it participates in comply with EU rules, there has been limited administrative and judicial interpretation of the rules. Restrictive interpretations of the guidelines could adversely affect the ability to commercially market the respective types of vessels in Commercial Pools.
In the highly competitive international market, OSG may not be able to compete effectively for charters. 
The Company&#8217;s vessels are employed in a highly competitive market. Competition arises from other vessel owners, including major oil companies, which may have substantially greater resources than OSG does. Competition for the transportation of crude oil and other petroleum products depends on price, location, size, age, condition, and the acceptability of the vessel operator to the charterer. The Company believes that because ownership of the world tanker fleet is highly fragmented, no single vessel owner is able to influence charter rates. To the extent OSG enters into new geographic regions or provides new services, it may not be able to compete profitably. New markets may involve competitive factors that differ from those of the Company&#8217;s current markets, and the competitors in those markets may have greater financial strength and capital resources than OSG does.
OSG may not realize the benefits it expects from past acquisitions or acquisitions or other strategic transactions it may make in the future. 
OSG&#8217;s business strategy includes ongoing efforts to engage in material acquisitions of ownership interests in entities in the tanker industry and of individual tankers. The success of OSG&#8217;s acquisitions will depend upon a number of factors, some of which may not be within its control. These factors include OSG&#8217;s ability to:
OSG intends to finance these acquisitions by using available cash from operations and through incurrence of debt or bridge financing, either of which may increase its leverage ratios, or by issuing equity, which may have a dilutive impact on its existing shareholders. At any given time OSG may be engaged in a number of discussions that may result in one or more acquisitions, some of which may be material to OSG as a whole. These opportunities require confidentiality and may involve negotiations that require quick responses by OSG. Although there can be no certainty that any of these discussions will result in definitive agreements or the completion of any transactions, the announcement of any such transaction may lead to increased volatility in the trading price of OSG&#8217;s securities.
In addition, the Company is currently considering various strategic alternatives that may result in a separation of its U.S. Flag and international businesses. The Company&#8217;s Board of Directors and management are reviewing various complex factors in connection with that process, and no assurance can be given as to whether or when any such transaction will occur or what form it might take. Any such transaction would be subject to similar risks and uncertainties.
Acquisitions and other transactions can also involve a number of special risks and challenges, including:
The success of acquisitions or strategic investments depends on the effective integration of newly acquired businesses or assets into OSG&#8217;s current operations. Such integration is subject to risks and uncertainties, including realization of anticipated synergies and cost savings, the ability to retain and attract personnel and clients, the diversion of management&#8217;s attention from other business concerns, and undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of the acquired company or asset. OSG may not realize the strategic and financial benefits that it expects from any of its past acquisitions, or any future acquisitions. Further, if a portion of the purchase price of a business is attributable to goodwill and if the acquired business does not perform up to expectations at the time of the acquisition some or all of the goodwill may be written off, adversely affecting OSG&#8217;s earnings. OSG has recorded material write-offs of goodwill and intangible assets in prior years related to earlier acquisitions it consummated.
Changes in demand in specialized markets in which the Company currently trades may lead the Company to redeploy certain vessels to other markets. 
The Company deploys its vessels in several specialized markets, including, without limitation, Lightering in the Delaware Bay. The Company conducts those Lightering operations with two ATBs which were constructed using funds withdrawn from the Company&#8217;s CCF. If there is lower demand in these markets, which adversely affects the Company&#8217;s financial position, the Company may have to consider redeploying these two ATBs in other markets. If that occurs, the Company may not be able to compete profitably in the new markets, and the ATBs may not be able to be redeployed to new markets without substantial modification.
Operating costs and capital expenses will increase as the Company&#8217;s vessels age and may also increase due to unanticipated events relating to secondhand vessels and the consolidation of suppliers. 
In general, capital expenditures and other costs necessary for maintaining a vessel in good operating condition increase as the age of the vessel increases. As of December 31, 2015, the weighted average age of the Company&#8217;s total owned and operated fleet was 10.6 years. In addition, older vessels are typically less fuel-efficient than more recently constructed vessels due to improvements in engine technology. Cargo insurance rates are also expected to increase with the age of a vessel, since older vessels may be less desirable to charterers. Accordingly, it is likely that the operating costs of OSG&#8217;s currently operated vessels will increase. In addition, changes in governmental regulations and compliance with Classification Society standards may restrict the type of activities in which the vessels may engage and/or may require OSG to make additional expenditures for new equipment. Every commercial tanker must pass inspection by a Classification Society authorized by the vessel&#8217;s country of registry. The Classification Society certifies that a tanker is safe and seaworthy in accordance with the applicable rule and regulations of the country of registry of the tanker and the international conventions of which that country is a number. If a Classification Society requires the Company to add equipment, OSG may be required to incur substantial costs or take its vessels out of service. Market conditions may not justify such expenditures or permit OSG to operate its older vessels profitably even if those vessels remain operational. If a vessel in OSG&#8217;s fleet does not maintain its class and/or fails any survey, it will be unemployable and unable to trade between ports. This would negatively impact the Company&#8217;s results of operation.
In addition, the Company&#8217;s fleet includes a number of secondhand vessels. While the Company typically inspects secondhand vessels before it purchases them, those inspections do not necessarily provide OSG with the same level of knowledge about those vessels&#8217; condition that OSG would have had if these vessels had been built for and operated exclusively by it. The Company may not discover defects or other problems with such vessels before purchase, which may lead to expensive, unanticipated repairs, and could even result in accidents or other incidents for which the Company could be liable.
Furthermore, recent mergers have reduced the number of available suppliers, resulting in fewer alternatives for sourcing key supplies. With respect to certain items, OSG is generally dependent upon the original equipment manufacturer for repair and replacement of the item or its spare parts. Supplier consolidation may result in a shortage of supplies and services, thereby increasing the cost of supplies or potentially inhibiting the ability of suppliers to deliver on time. These cost increases or delays could result in downtime, and delays in the repair and maintenance of the Company&#8217;s vessels and FSOs and have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
The Company derives a substantial portion of its U.S. Flag segment&#8217;s revenue from a limited number of customers, and the loss of, or reduction in business by, any of these customers could materially adversely affect the U.S. Flag segment&#8217;s business, financial condition and results of operations. 
The U.S. Flag segment&#8217;s largest customers account for a significant portion of its revenues. The U.S. Flag segment&#8217;s top five customers comprised approximately 61% of the U.S. Flag segment&#8217;s revenues during 2015. The loss of, or reduction in business by, any of these customers could materially adversely affect the U.S. Flag segment&#8217;s business, financial condition and results of operations.
The lifting of the U.S. crude oil export ban could adversely impact the Company&#8217;s U.S. Flag Fleet. 
Over the last four decades, the ability of U.S. producers to export domestic crude oil has been restricted by the U.S. government. In December 2015, the U.S. government enacted the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, which, among other things, removed the restriction on the export of domestic crude oil from the United States. Although the impact of the lifting of the ban on the Company&#8217;s U.S. Flag fleet&#8217;s operations is not determinable, the removal of the crude oil export restrictions could result in reduced coastwise transportation of crude oil, which may have an adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s U.S. Flag segment.
Certain potential customers will not use vessels older than a specified age, even if they have been subsequently rebuilt. 
All of the Company&#8217;s existing ATBs with the exception of the OSG Vision/OSG 350 and the OSG Horizon/OSG 351 were originally constructed more than 25 years ago. While all of these tug-barge units were rebuilt and double-hulled since 1998 and are &#8220;in-class,&#8221; meaning the vessel has been certified by a Classification Society as being built and maintained in accordance with the rules of that Classification Society and complies with the applicable rules and regulations of the vessel&#8217;s country of registry and applicable international conventions, some potential customers have stated that they will not charter vessels that are more than 20 years old, even if they have been rebuilt. Other customers may not continue to view rebuilt vessels as suitable. If more customers differentiate rebuilt vessels, time charter rates for the Company&#8217;s rebuilt ATBs will likely be adversely affected or they may not be employable.
The Company&#8217;s significant operating leases could be replaced on less favorable terms or may not be replaced. 
The Company&#8217;s operating fleet includes 17 vessels that have been chartered-in under operating leases. The significant operating leases of the Company in its various businesses expire at various points in the future and may not be replaced at all or on as favorable terms, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s future financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
The Company is subject to credit risks with respect to its counterparties on contracts, and any failure by those counterparties to meet their obligations could cause the Company to suffer losses on such contracts, decreasing revenues and earnings. 
The Company has entered into, and in the future will enter into, various contracts, including charter agreements, joint venture agreements and other agreements associated with the operation of its vessels. The Company charters its vessels to other parties, who pay the Company a daily rate of hire. The Company also enters COAs and Voyage Charters. Historically, the Company has not experienced material problems collecting charter hire but the global economic downturn of recent years has affected charterers more severely than the prior recessions that have occurred since the Company&#8217;s establishment more than 45 years ago. The Company also Time Charters or Bareboat Charters some of its vessels from other parties and its continued use and operation of such vessels depends on the vessel owners&#8217; compliance with the terms of the time charter or bareboat charter. Additionally, the Company enters into derivative contracts (interest rate swaps and caps) from time to time. As a result, the Company is subject to credit risks. The ability of each of the Company&#8217;s counterparties to perform its obligations under a contract with it will depend on a number of factors that are beyond the Company&#8217;s control and may include, among other things, general economic conditions; availability of debt or equity financing; the condition of the maritime and offshore industries; the overall financial condition of the counterparty; charter rates received for specific types of vessels; and various expenses. Charterers are sensitive to the commodity markets and may be impacted by market forces affecting commodities such as oil. In addition, in depressed market conditions, the Company&#8217;s charterers and customers may no longer need a vessel that is currently under charter or contract or may be able to obtain a comparable vessel at lower rates. As a result, the Company&#8217;s customers may fail to pay charter hire or attempt to renegotiate charter rates. If the counterparties fail to meet their obligations, the Company could suffer losses on such contracts which would decrease revenues, cash flows and earnings.
The counterparty to OSG&#8217;s largest Delaware Bay Lightering contract has approached the Company about restructuring the contract to lower the minimum volumes contained therein and has indicated that the termination or reduction payment that they would be required to make under the terms of the underlying contract would pose an unreasonable economic burden. If the counterparty fails to comply with the terms of the existing long-term contract, including provisions requiring that compensation be paid to the Company under certain circumstances, and OSG is unable to obtain replacement time charters at desirable rates, the Company&#8217;s profitability and cash flows may be adversely affected.
The Company depends on its key personnel and may have difficulty attracting and retaining skilled employees. 
OSG&#8217;s success depends to a significant extent upon the abilities and efforts of its key personnel. The loss of the services of key personnel or the Company&#8217;s inability to attract, motivate and retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, all of the Company&#8217;s seven executive officers have served in their current positions for less than two years and all ten members of the Board were first elected in or after August 2014 (three directors were first elected in August 2015).
Work stoppages or other labor disruptions by the unionized employees of OSG or other companies in related industries may adversely affect OSG&#8217;s operations. 
As of December 31, 2015, OSG had approximately 890 regular full-time employees, of which 632 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions. See Item 1, &#8220;Business ___ Employees.&#8221; In addition, OSG relies on the services of third parties who employ persons covered by collective bargaining agreements. OSG could be adversely affected by actions taken by employees of OSG or other companies in related industries (including third parties providing services to OSG) against efforts by management to control labor costs, restrain wage or benefits increases or modify work practices or the failure of OSG or other companies in its industry to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements.
The Company may face unexpected drydock costs for its vessels. 
Vessels must be drydocked periodically. For example, the USCG requires the Company&#8217;s vessels to be drydocked for inspection and maintenance twice every five years. The cost of repairs and renewals required at each drydock are difficult to predict with certainty, can be substantial and the Company&#8217;s insurance does not cover these costs. In addition, vessels may have to be drydocked in the event of accidents or other unforeseen damage, and OSG&#8217;s insurance may not cover all of these costs. Vessels in drydock will generally not generate any income. Large drydocking expenses could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the time when a vessel is out of service for maintenance is determined by a number of factors including regulatory deadlines, market conditions, shipyard availability and customer requirements, and accordingly the length of time that a vessel may be off-hire may be longer than anticipated, which could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Technological innovation could reduce the Company&#8217;s charter income and the value of the Company&#8217;s vessels. 
The charter rates and the value and operational life of a vessel are determined by a number of factors including the vessel&#8217;s efficiency, operational flexibility and physical life. Efficiency includes speed, fuel economy and the ability to load and discharge cargo quickly. Flexibility includes the ability to enter harbors, utilize related docking facilities and pass through canals and straits. The length of a vessel&#8217;s physical life is related to its original design and construction, its maintenance and the impact of the stress of operations. If new tankers are built that are more efficient or more flexible or have longer physical lives than the Company&#8217;s vessels, competition from these more technologically advanced vessels could adversely affect the amount of charter payments the Company receives for its vessels once their initial charters expire and the resale value of the Company&#8217;s vessels could significantly decrease. As a result, the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.
Interruption or failure of OSG&#8217;s information technology and communications systems could impair its ability to operate and adversely affect its business. 
OSG is highly dependent on information technology systems. These dependencies include accounting, billing, disbursement, cargo booking and tracking, vessel scheduling and stowage, equipment tracking, customer service, banking, payroll and communication systems. Information technology and communication systems are subject to reliability issues, integration and compatibility concerns, and security-threatening intrusions. OSG may experience failures caused by the occurrence of a natural disaster, computer hacking or viruses or other unanticipated problems at OSG&#8217;s facilities, aboard its vessels or at third-party locations. Any failure of OSG&#8217;s or third-party systems could result in interruptions in service, reductions in its revenue and profits, damage to its reputation or liability for the release of confidential information.
A portion of OSG&#8217;s revenues are subject to seasonal variations. 
OSG operates its tankers in markets that have historically exhibited seasonal variations in demand for tanker capacity, and therefore, charter rates. Peaks in tanker demand quite often precede seasonal oil consumption peaks, as refiners and suppliers anticipate consumer demand. Charter rates for tankers are typically higher in the fall and winter months as a result of increased oil consumption in the Northern Hemisphere. Unpredictable weather patterns and variations in oil reserves disrupt tanker scheduling. Because a majority of the Company&#8217;s vessels trade in the spot market, seasonality has affected OSG&#8217;s operating results on a quarter-to-quarter basis and could continue to do so in the future. Such seasonality may be outweighed in any period by then current economic conditions or tanker industry fundamentals.
Effective internal controls are necessary for the Company to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. 
The Company maintains a system of internal controls to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The process of designing and implementing effective internal controls is a continuous effort that requires the Company to anticipate and react to changes in its business and the economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy its reporting obligations as a public company.
Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase the Company&#8217;s operating costs and harm its business. Furthermore, investors&#8217; perceptions that the Company&#8217;s internal controls are inadequate or that the Company is unable to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis may harm its stock price.
Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters 
The Company&#8217;s business would be adversely affected if it failed to comply with the Jones Act&#8217;s limitations on U.S. coastwise trade, or if these limitations were waived, modified or repealed, or if changes in international trade agreements were to occur. 
Certain of the Company&#8217;s U.S. Flag operations are conducted in the U.S. coastwise trade and are governed by U.S. federal laws commonly known as the &#8220;Jones Act&#8221;. The Jones Act restricts waterborne transportation of goods between points in the United States to vessels meeting certain requirements, including ownership and control by &#8220;U.S. Citizens&#8221; as defined thereunder. The Company is responsible for monitoring the foreign ownership of its common stock and other interests to ensure compliance with the Jones Act. The Company could lose the privilege of owning and operating vessels in the Jones Act trade if non-U.S. Citizens were to own or control, in the aggregate, more than 25% of the equity interests in the Company. Such loss would have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business and results of operations. In addition, under certain circumstances failure to comply with the Jones Act may result in the Company being deemed to have violated other U.S. federal laws that prohibit a foreign transfer of U.S. documented vessels without government approval, resulting in severe penalties, including permanent loss of U.S. coastwise trading privileges or forfeiture of the vessels deemed transferred, and fines.
Additionally, maritime transportation services are currently excluded from the General Agreement on Trade in Services (&#8220;GATS&#8221;) and are the subject of reservations by the United States in the North American Free Trade Agreement (&#8220;NAFTA&#8221;) and other international free trade agreements. If maritime transportation services were included in GATS, NAFTA or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise repealed or altered, the transportation of maritime cargo between U.S. ports could be opened to international flag or foreign built vessels. During the past several years, interest groups have lobbied Congress, and legislation has been introduced, to repeal certain provisions of the Jones Act to facilitate international flag competition for trades and cargoes currently reserved for U.S. Flag vessels under the Jones Act. The Company expects that continued efforts will be made to modify or repeal the Jones Act. Because international vessels may have lower construction costs, wage rates and operating costs, this could significantly increase competition in the coastwise trade, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
Governments could requisition the Company&#8217;s vessels during a period of war or emergency, which may negatively impact the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and available cash. 
A government could requisition one or more of the Company&#8217;s vessels for title or hire. Requisition for title occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and becomes the owner. Requisition for hire occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and effectively becomes the charterer at dictated charter rates. Generally, requisitions occur during a period of war or emergency. In addition, two OSG vessels participate in the U.S. Maritime Security Program, which ensures that militarily useful U.S. Flag vessels are available to the U.S. Department of Defense in the event of war or national emergency. These vessels are required to trade outside the United States but are eligible for government-sponsored business. Under the program, OSG receives an annual fee, subject in each case to annual Congressional appropriations, in exchange for a guarantee that the ships will be made available to the U.S. government in the time of war or national emergency. Government requisition of one or more of the Company&#8217;s vessels may negatively impact the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and available cash.
The Company&#8217;s vessels may be directed to call on ports located in countries that are subject to restrictions imposed by the U.S. government, which could negatively affect the trading price of the Company&#8217;s common shares. 
From time to time, certain of the Company&#8217;s vessels, on the instructions of the charterers or pool manager responsible for the commercial management of such vessels, have called and may again call on ports located in countries or territories, and/or operated by persons, subject to sanctions and embargoes imposed by the U.S. government, the United Nations (&#8220;UN&#8221;) or the EU and countries identified by the U.S. government, the UN or the EU as state sponsors of terrorism. The U.S., UN and EU sanctions and embargo laws and regulations vary in their application, as they do not all apply to the same covered persons or proscribe the same activities, and such sanctions and embargo laws and regulations may be amended or expanded over time. Some sanctions may also apply to transportation of goods (including crude oil) originating in sanctioned countries (particularly Iran), even if the vessel does not travel to those countries, or otherwise acting on behalf of sanctioned persons. Sanctions may include the imposition of penalties and fines against companies violating national law or companies acting outside the jurisdiction of the sanctioning power themselves becoming the target of sanctions.
Although OSG believes that it is in compliance with all applicable sanctions and embargo laws and regulations and intends to maintain such compliance, and OSG does not, and does not intend to, engage in sanctionable activity, OSG might fail to comply or may engage in a sanctionable activity in the future, particularly as the scope of certain laws may be unclear and may be subject to changing interpretations. Any such violation or sanctionable activity could result in fines or other penalties, or the imposition of sanctions against the Company, and could result in some investors deciding, or being required, to divest their interest, or not to invest, in the Company and negatively affect OSG&#8217;s reputation and investor perception of the value of OSG&#8217;s common stock.
Compliance with complex laws, regulations, and, in particular, environmental laws or regulations, including those relating to the emission of greenhouse gases, may adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business. 
The Company&#8217;s operations are affected by extensive and changing international, national and local environmental protection laws, regulations, treaties, conventions and standards in force in international waters, the jurisdictional waters of the countries in which OSG&#8217;s vessels operate, as well as the countries of its vessels&#8217; registration. Many of these requirements are designed to reduce the risk of oil spills. They also regulate other water pollution issues, including discharge of ballast water and effluents and air emissions, including emission of greenhouse gases. These requirements impose significant capital and operating costs on OSG, including, without limitation, ones related to engine adjustments and ballast water treatment.
Environmental laws and regulations also can affect the resale value or significantly reduce the useful lives of the Company&#8217;s vessels, require a reduction in carrying capacity, ship modifications or operational changes or restrictions (and related increased operating costs) or retirement of service, lead to decreased availability or higher cost of insurance coverage for environmental matters or result in the denial of access to, or detention in, certain jurisdictional waters or ports. Under local, national and foreign laws, as well as international treaties and conventions, OSG could incur material liabilities, including cleanup obligations, in the event that there is a release of petroleum or other hazardous substances from its vessels or otherwise in connection with its operations. OSG could also become subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to the release of or exposure to hazardous materials associated with its current or historic operations. Violations of or liabilities under environmental requirements also can result in substantial penalties, fines and other sanctions, including in certain instances, seizure or detention of the Company&#8217;s vessels.
OSG could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs, fines, penalties, third-party claims and natural resource damages, as the result of an oil spill or liabilities under environmental laws. The Company is subject to the oversight of several government agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Maritime Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation. OPA 90 affects all vessel owners shipping oil or hazardous material to, from or within the United States. OPA 90 allows for potentially unlimited liability without regard to fault for owners, operators and bareboat charterers of vessels for oil pollution in U.S. waters. Similarly, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, as amended, which has been adopted by most countries outside of the United States, imposes liability for oil pollution in international waters. OPA 90 expressly permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to hazardous materials and oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries. Coastal states in the United States have enacted pollution prevention liability and response laws, many providing for unlimited liability. Similarly, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, as amended, which has been adopted by most countries outside of the United States, imposes liability for oil pollution in international waters.
In addition, in complying with OPA 90, IMO regulations, EU directives and other existing laws and regulations and those that may be adopted, shipowners likely will incur substantial additional capital and/or operating expenditures in meeting new regulatory requirements, in developing contingency arrangements for potential spills and in obtaining insurance coverage. Key regulatory initiatives that are anticipated to require substantial additional capital and/or operating expenditures in the next several years include more stringent limits on the sulfur content of fuel oil for vessels operating in certain areas and more stringent requirements for management and treatment of ballast water.
Beginning in 2016, OSG believes that one of its vessels will become subject to more stringent numeric discharge limits of ballast water under the EPA&#8217;s VGP, with additional vessels becoming subject in future years, even though that vessel has obtained a valid extension from the USCG for implementation of treatment technology under the USCG&#8217;s final rules. The EPA has determined that it will not issue extensions under the VGP but has stated that vessels that (i) have received an extension from the USCG (ii) are in compliance with all of the VGP requirements other than numeric discharge limits and (iii) meeting certain other requirements will be entitled to &#8220;low enforcement priority&#8221;. While OSG believes that any vessel that is or may become subject to the more stringent numeric discharge limits of ballast water meets the conditions for &#8220;low enforcement priority,&#8221; no assurance can be given that they will do so. If the EPA determines to enforce the limits for such vessels, such action could have a material adverse effect on OSG. See Item 1, &#8220;Business ___ Environmental and Security Matters Relating to Bulk Shipping.&#8221;
Other government regulation of vessels, particularly in the areas of safety and environmental requirements, can be expected to become more strict in the future and require the Company to incur significant capital expenditures on its vessels to keep them in compliance, or even to scrap or sell certain vessels altogether. Such expenditures could result in financial and operational impacts that may be material to OSG&#8217;s financial statements. Additionally, the failure of a shipowner or bareboat charterer to comply with local, domestic and foreign regulations may subject it to increased liability, may invalidate existing insurance or decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports. For example, in February 2015, the USCG personnel detained the tanker Overseas Jademar in Port Angeles, Washington for violation of safety regulations, which included non-functioning distress signaling equipment and fire safety systems. If any of our vessels are denied access to, or are detained in, certain ports, reputation, business, financial results and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
Accidents involving highly publicized oil spills and other mishaps involving vessels can be expected in the tanker industry, and such accidents or other events could be expected to result in the adoption of even stricter laws and regulations, which could limit the Company&#8217;s operations or its ability to do business and which could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial results and cash flows. In addition, the Company is required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain certain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to its operations. The Company believes its vessels are maintained in good condition in compliance with present regulatory requirements, are operated in compliance with applicable safety and environmental laws and regulations and are insured against usual risks for such amounts as the Company&#8217;s management deems appropriate. The vessels&#8217; operating certificates and licenses are renewed periodically during each vessel&#8217;s required annual survey. However, government regulation of tankers, particularly in the areas of safety and environmental impact may change in the future and require the Company to incur significant capital expenditures with respect to its ships to keep them in compliance.
Due to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries, including the United States, and international organizations, including the EU, the IMO and the UN, have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These regulatory measures include, among others, adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. Such actions could result in significant financial and operational impacts on the Company&#8217;s business, including requiring OSG to install new emission controls, acquire allowances or pay taxes related to its greenhouse gas emissions, or administer and manage a greenhouse gas emission program. See Item 1, &#8220;Business ___ Environmental and Security Matters Relating to Bulk Shipping.&#8221; In addition to the added costs, the concern over climate change and regulatory measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may reduce global demand for oil and oil products, which would have an adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial results and cash flows.
The employment of the Company&#8217;s vessels could be adversely affected by an inability to clear the oil majors&#8217; risk assessment process. 
The shipping industry, and especially vessels that transport crude oil and refined petroleum products, is heavily regulated. In addition, the &#8220;oil majors&#8221; such as BP, Chevron Corporation, ConocoPhillips Company, Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell, and Total S.A. have developed a strict due diligence process for selecting their shipping partners out of concerns for the environmental impact of spills. This vetting process has evolved into a sophisticated and comprehensive risk assessment of both the vessel manager and the vessel, including audits of the management office and physical inspections of the ship. Under the terms of the Company&#8217;s charter agreements, the Company&#8217;s charterers require that the Company&#8217;s vessels and the technical managers pass vetting inspections and management audits respectively. The Company&#8217;s failure to maintain any of its vessels to the standards required by the oil majors could put the Company in breach of the applicable charter agreement and lead to termination of such agreement. Should the Company not be able to successfully clear the oil majors&#8217; risk assessment processes on an ongoing basis, the future employment of the Company&#8217;s vessels could be adversely affected since it might lead to the oil majors&#8217; terminating existing charters.
The Company may be subject to litigation and government inquiries or investigations that, if not resolved in the Company&#8217;s favor and not sufficiently covered by insurance, could have a material adverse effect on it. 
The Company has been and is, from time to time, involved in various litigation matters and subject to government inquiries and investigations. These matters may include, among other things, regulatory proceedings and litigation arising out of or relating to matters related to the restatement of the Company&#8217;s financial statements in 2012, contract disputes, personal injury claims, environmental claims or proceedings, asbestos and other toxic tort claims, employment matters, governmental claims for taxes or duties, and other disputes that arise in the ordinary course of the Company&#8217;s business. In particular, the Company is subject to an investigation by the SEC&#8217;s Division of Enforcement related to tax issues raised in the Company&#8217;s October 22, 2012 Form 8-K, and the SEC filed a proof of claim against the Company in the Bankruptcy Court in connection with that investigation. To the extent this claim is allowed by the Bankruptcy Court, the Equity Plan provides a maximum reserve of up to $5 million as the exclusive source from which to satisfy any liabilities on account of that claim. In the event that the SEC asserts separate claims against individuals affiliated with the Company, liabilities associated with such claims are not included in this reserve, and any such liabilities not covered by insurance may be subject to reimbursement by the Company, subject to the terms of the Equity Plan. Additionally, there are a number of pending lawsuits alleging injuries related to purported asbestos exposure in various state and federal courts, as well as certain proofs of claim alleging such exposure pending before the Bankruptcy Court. The Company believes it has insurance coverage for the majority, though not all, of these cases.
Although the Company intends to defend these matters vigorously, it cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any such matter, and the ultimate outcome of these matters or the potential costs to resolve them could involve or result in significant expenditures or losses by the Company, or result in significant changes to OSG&#8217;s tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s future operating results, including profitability, cash flows, and financial condition. Insurance may not be applicable or sufficient in all cases and/or insurers may not remain solvent which may have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s financial condition. The Company&#8217;s recorded liabilities and estimates of reasonably possible losses for its contingent liabilities are based on its assessment of potential liability using the information available to the Company at the time and, as applicable, any past experience and trends with respect to similar matters. However, because litigation is inherently uncertain, the Company&#8217;s estimates for contingent liabilities may be insufficient to cover the actual liabilities from such claims, resulting in a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See Item 3, &#8220;Legal Proceedings,&#8221; and Note 21, &#8220;Contingencies,&#8221; to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 __ &#8220;Financial Statement and Supplementary Data.&#8221;
The smuggling of drugs or other contraband onto the Company&#8217;s vessels may lead to governmental claims against the Company. 
The Company expects that its vessels will call in ports where smugglers attempt to hide drugs and other contraband on vessels, with or without the knowledge of crew members. To the extent the Company&#8217;s vessels are found with contraband, whether inside or attached to the hull of our vessel and whether with or without the knowledge of any of its crew, we may face governmental or other regulatory claims which could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Maritime claimants could arrest OSG&#8217;s vessels, which could interrupt cash flows. 
Crew members, suppliers of goods and services to a vessel, shippers of cargo and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against that vessel for unsatisfied debts, claims or damages. In many jurisdictions, a maritime lien holder may enforce its lien by arresting a vessel through foreclosure proceedings. The arrest or attachment of one or more of the Company&#8217;s vessels could interrupt OSG&#8217;s cash flow and require it to pay a significant amount of money to have the arrest lifted. In addition, in some jurisdictions, such as South Africa, under the &#8220;sister ship&#8221; theory of liability, a claimant may arrest both the vessel that is subject to the claimant&#8217;s maritime lien and any &#8220;associated&#8221; vessel, meaning any vessel owned or controlled by the same owner. Claimants could try to assert &#8220;sister ship&#8221; liability against one vessel in the Company&#8217;s fleet for claims relating to another vessel in its fleet which, if successful, could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
The Company&#8217;s U.S. federal income tax position in respect of certain credit agreement borrowings used by OIN is not free from doubt. 
The Company has taken the position that certain drawdowns by the Company under the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility used solely by OIN should not be taken into account in determining amounts includible in OSG&#8217;s income as deemed dividends under section 951(a)(1)(B) and section 956 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for taxable years 2013 and earlier. Although the Company believes that it has a strong basis for taking this position, there is no authority directly on point and the Company has established a reserve in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 740. If the IRS were to challenge the Company&#8217;s position, the Company&#8217;s total cash exposure could exceed the reserve, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Transfers or issuances of the Company&#8217;s equity may impair or reduce the Company&#8217;s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes in the future. 
Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, contain rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an &#8220;ownership change&#8221; to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change. An &#8220;ownership change&#8221; is generally defined as any change in ownership of more than 50% of a corporation&#8217;s stock over a rolling three-year period by stockholders that own (directly or indirectly) 5% or more of the stock of a corporation, or arising from a new issuance of stock by a corporation. If an ownership change occurs, Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the use of pre-ownership change NOLs, credits and certain other tax attributes to offset taxable income earned after the ownership change. The annual limitation is equal to the product of the applicable long-term tax exempt rate and the value of the company&#8217;s stock immediately before the ownership change. This annual limitation may be adjusted to reflect any unused annual limitation for prior years and certain recognized built-in gains and losses for the year. In addition, Section 383 generally limits the amount of tax liability in any post-ownership change year that can be reduced by pre-ownership change tax credit carryforwards. If the Company were to undergo an &#8220;ownership change,&#8221; it could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
OSG&#8217;s financial condition would be materially adversely affected if the shipping income of OSG&#8217;s foreign subsidiaries becomes subject to current taxation in the United States. 
As a result of changes made by the American Jobs Creations Act of 2004 (&#8220;2004 Act&#8221;), the Company does not include in its U.S. tax return on a current basis the unrepatriated shipping income earned by its international flag vessels, which in recent years represented substantially all of the Company&#8217;s pre-tax income. These changes in the 2004 Act were made to make U.S.-controlled shipping companies competitive with foreign-controlled shipping companies, which are generally incorporated in jurisdictions in which they either do not pay income taxes or pay minimal income taxes. The taxation of OSG&#8217;s foreign subsidiaries under U.S. laws is a complex area and is subject to ongoing analysis and recalculation, which can have a material impact on the Company. See Note 13, &#8220;Taxes,&#8221; to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statement and Supplementary Data.&#8221;
The President and several Congressmen and Senators have announced support for repealing certain tax provisions that purportedly incentivize companies to move jobs from the United States to foreign countries. While the Company believes that the changes made in the 2004 Act with respect to foreign shipping income do not &#8220;incentivize moving jobs offshore,&#8221; and, in fact, have enabled the Company to expand its U.S. Flag fleet and create jobs in the United States, Congress may decide to repeal the changes made in the 2004 Act with respect to taxation of foreign shipping income for the aforementioned reason or as part of initiatives to reduce the U.S. budget deficit or to reform the U.S. corporate tax regime. Such repeal, either directly or indirectly by limiting or reducing benefits received under the 2004 Act, could have a materially adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial results and cash flows.
Risks Related to the Common Stock and Warrants 
The market price of the Company&#8217;s securities may fluctuate significantly .
The market price of the Company&#8217;s securities may fluctuate substantially. You may not be able to resell your Class A or Class B common stock or Class A or Class B warrants at or above the price you paid for such securities due to a number of factors, some of which are beyond the Company&#8217;s control. These risks include those described or referred to in this &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section and under &#8220;Forward -Looking Statements,&#8221; as well as, among other things: fluctuations in the Company&#8217;s operating results; activities of and results of operations of the Company&#8217;s competitors; changes in the Company&#8217;s relationships with the Company&#8217;s customers or the Company&#8217;s vendors; changes in business or regulatory conditions; changes in the Company&#8217;s capital structure; any announcements by the Company or its competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic alliances or joint ventures; additions or departures of key personnel; investors&#8217; general perception of the Company; failure to meet market expectations; future sales of the Company&#8217;s securities by it, directors, executives and significant stockholders; changes in domestic and international economic and political conditions; and other events or factors, including those resulting from natural disasters, war, acts of terrorism or responses to these events. Any of the foregoing factors could also cause the price of the Company&#8217;s equity securities to fall and may expose the Company to securities class action litigation. Any securities class action litigation could result in substantial cost and the diversion of management&#8217;s attention and resources.
In addition, the stock market has recently experienced volatility that, in some cases, has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the Company&#8217;s securities, regardless of its actual operating performance.
The Company&#8217;s stock and warrants are thinly traded, and your ability to sell such securities may be limited. 
The Company&#8217;s Class A warrants and Class B warrants are currently traded as &#8220;restricted securities&#8221; in the over-the-counter market and in privately negotiated transactions among individual holders pursuant to exemptions from the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Transactions are reported as taking place only sporadically. Certain broker-dealers report quotes for the purchase and sale of Class A warrants and Class B warrants. The Company cannot assure you as to the liquidity of any market that may develop for the Class A warrants or Class B warrants, your ability to sell your Class A warrants or Class B warrants or the price at which you would be able to sell such securities.
The Company&#8217;s Class A common stock and the Company&#8217;s Class B common stock is listed on New York Stock Exchange MKT system. However, trading volume has been relatively low. Low levels of liquidity may make it difficult for you to sell your Class A common stock or your Class B common stock at any particular time.
The exercise of outstanding warrants may result in substantial dilution to the Company&#8217;s stockholders. 
As of February 24, 2016, the Company had outstanding:
Collectively, if exercised, the shares of common stock underlying these warrants would represent, as of that date, approximately 36% of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common stock following such exercise. Accordingly, any such exercise would result in substantial dilution to the Company&#8217;s stockholders.
The Company&#8217;s common stock is subject to restrictions on foreign ownership, which could have a negative impact on the transferability of the Company&#8217;s common stock, its liquidity and market value, and on a change of control of the Company. 
The Company&#8217;s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws authorize its Board of Directors to establish with respect to any class or series of capital stock of the Company certain rules, policies and procedures, including procedures with respect to transfer of shares, to assist in monitoring and maintaining compliance with the Jones Act ownership restrictions. In order to provide a reasonable margin for compliance with the Jones Act, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors has determined that until further action by it, at least 77% (the &#8220;Minimum Percentage&#8221;) of the outstanding shares of each class of capital stock of the Company must be owned by U.S. Citizens. Moreover, the Company&#8217;s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws provide that any purported transfer of equity interests in the Company that caused the percentage of outstanding shares of a class of capital stock of the Company to fall below the Minimum Percentage will be ineffective to transfer the equity interests or any voting, dividend or other rights associated with such interests.
The percentage of U.S. citizenship ownership of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common stock fluctuates based on daily trading, and at times in the past, including at times in 2015 and 2016, has declined to the Minimum Percentage. At and during such time that the Minimum Percentage is reached with respect to outstanding shares of a class of the Company&#8217;s stock, the Company is unable to issue any further shares of such class of common stock or approve transfers of such class of common stock to non-U.S. Citizens among other things. The existence and enforcement of these ownership restrictions could have an adverse impact on the liquidity or market value of the Company&#8217;s equity securities. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, the ownership restrictions could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of the Company.
The Company&#8217;s outstanding warrants are not subject to the above ownership restrictions, but the warrants include provisions limiting the right of non-U.S. Citizens to exercise warrants if the shares of common stock that would be issued upon exercise would cause the percentage of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common stock held by U.S. Citizens to decline below the Minimum Percentage.
The Company has a limited history of paying cash dividends on its securities. 
The Company has not paid any regular cash dividends since the third quarter of 2011. On February 29, 2016, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.08 per share of common stock payable prior to the end of March 2016. The declaration and timing of future cash dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things, our future operations and earnings, capital requirements, general financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law or the SEC and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant.
OSG is a holding company and depends on the ability of its subsidiaries to distribute funds to it in order to satisfy its financial obligations or pay dividends. 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. is a holding company and its subsidiaries conduct all of its operations and own all of its operating assets. It has no significant assets other than the equity interests in its subsidiaries. As a result, its ability to satisfy its financial obligations or pay dividends is dependent on the ability of its subsidiaries to distribute funds to it. In addition, the terms of the Exit Financing Facilities restrict the ability of OIN, OBS and their respective subsidiaries to distribute funds to Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc.
Some provisions of Delaware law and the Company&#8217;s governing documents could influence its ability to effect a change of control. 
Certain provisions of Delaware law and contained in the Company&#8217;s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of the Company. In addition, these provisions could make it more difficult to bring about a change in the composition of the Company&#8217;s board of directors. For example, the Company&#8217;s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws:
These and other provisions of the Company&#8217;s organizational documents and Delaware law may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing changes of control or changes in management, even if such transactions or changes would have significant benefits for its stockholders. As a result, these provisions could limit the price some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock.
Separately, the Company has elected to opt out of Section 203 (&#8220;Section 203&#8221;) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the &#8220;DGCL&#8221;), which restricts certain business combinations between a Delaware corporation and an &#8220;interested stockholder.&#8221; Accordingly, the Company will be able to enter into such transactions with its principal stockholders without complying with the requirements of Section 203. The election to opt out of Section 203 could deprive certain stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of the Company, particularly if it enters into a transaction with an &#8220;interested stockholder.&#8221;

The following important risk factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements made in this report or presented elsewhere by management from time to time. If any of the circumstances or events described below actually arise or occur, the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Actual dollar amounts are used in this Item 1 A. &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section.
Risks Related to Our Industry 
The highly cyclical nature of the industry may lead to volatile changes in charter rates and vessel values, which could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s earnings and available cash. 
The tanker industry is both cyclical and volatile in terms of charter rates and profitability. Fluctuations in charter rates and vessel values result from changes in supply and demand both for tanker capacity and for oil and oil products. Factors affecting these changes in supply and demand are generally outside of the Company&#8217;s control. The nature, timing and degree of changes in industry conditions are unpredictable and could adversely affect the values of the Company&#8217;s vessels or result in significant fluctuations in the amount of charter revenues the Company earns, which could result in significant volatility in OSG&#8217;s quarterly results and cash flows. Factors influencing the demand for tanker capacity include:
Factors influencing the supply of vessel capacity include:
Many of the factors that influence the demand for tanker capacity will also, in the longer term, effectively influence the supply of tanker capacity, since decisions to build new capacity, invest in capital repairs, or to retain in service older obsolescent capacity are influenced by the general state of the marine transportation industry from time to time.
The market value of vessels fluctuates significantly, which could adversely affect OSG&#8217;s liquidity or otherwise adversely affect its financial condition. 
The market value of vessels has fluctuated over time. The fluctuation in market value of vessels over time is based upon various factors, including:
Worldwide vessel market values have, on average, generally declined over the past several years. In addition, as vessels grow older, they generally decline in value. These factors will affect the value of the Company&#8217;s vessels at the time of any vessel sale. If OSG sells a vessel at a sale price that is less than the vessel&#8217;s carrying amount on the Company&#8217;s financial statements, OSG will incur a loss on the sale and a reduction in earnings and surplus. In addition, declining values of the Company&#8217;s vessels could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s liquidity by limiting its ability to raise cash by refinancing vessels.
Declines in charter rates and other market deterioration could cause OSG to incur impairment charges. 
The Company evaluates the carrying amounts of its vessels to determine if events have occurred that would require an impairment of those vessels&#8217; carrying amounts. The recoverable amount of vessels is reviewed to determine whether there have been any events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recovered. This review for potential impairment indicators and projection of future cash flows related to the vessels is complex and requires the Company to make various estimates, including future freight rates, earnings from the vessels and discount rates. All of these items have historically been volatile. The Company evaluates the recoverable amount as the higher of either fair value less costs to sell or value in use. If the recoverable amount is less than the vessel&#8217;s carrying amount of the vessel, the vessel is deemed impaired. The carrying values of the Company&#8217;s vessels may differ significantly from their fair market value.
An increase in the supply of vessels without a commensurate increase in demand for such vessels could cause charter rates to remain at depressed levels or to further decline, which could adversely affect OSG&#8217;s revenues, profitability and cash flows, as well as the value of its vessels. 
OSG depends on short term duration or &#8220;spot&#8221;, charters, for a significant portion of its revenues, which exposes OSG to fluctuations in market conditions. In 2014, 2013 and 2012, OSG derived approximately 51%, 52% and 64% respectively, of its TCE revenues in the spot market.
The marine transportation industry has historically been highly cyclical, as the profitability and asset values of companies in the industry have fluctuated based on changes in the supply and demand of vessels. If the number of new ships of a particular class delivered exceeds the number of vessels of that class being scrapped, available capacity in that class will increase The newbuilding order book (representing vessels in various stages of planning or construction) equaled 13%, 12% and 11% of the existing world tanker fleet as of December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
In the U.S. domestic market, since the first quarter of 2013, firm orders to build 14 tankers and nine ATBs have been announced, representing approximately 31% of the existing Jones Act fleet of Product Carriers and large ATBs (defined as vessels having carrying capacities of between 0.14 million barrels and 0.35 million barrels, which excludes numerous tank barges below 0.14 million barrel capacity and 11 much larger tankers dedicated exclusively to the Alaskan crude oil trade), which exceeds the anticipated levels of scrapping. Delivery of those tankers is expected to take place between 2015 and 2017. Given the smaller number of tankers operating in the U.S. domestic market, even a limited increase in capacity supply may negatively impact the market.
Vessel supply is also affected by the number of vessels being used for floating storage, since vessels used for storage are not available to transport crude oil or petroleum products. Utilization of vessels for storage is affected by expectations of changes in the price of oil and petroleum products, with utilization generally increasing if prices are expected to increase more than storage costs and generally decreasing if they are not. A reduction in vessel utilization for storage will generally increase vessel supply. In 2010, for example, 81 vessels were released from storage and reentered the trading fleet. Since the 2010 release until near the end of 2014, storage on vessels at sea has been low, in part because then-current prices of crude oil have generally exceeded the future prices, a condition that allows companies to replace inventories at lower prices, which encourages the drawdown of commercial inventories. Supply has exceeded demand during the past five years, resulting in lower charter rates across the International Flag fleet. Since December 2014, current prices of crude oil have generally been below future prices, resulting in an increase in vessels used for storage. However, the duration of this trend of higher future prices cannot be predicted. If this trend ceases or reverses, the charter rates for the Company&#8217;s International Flag vessels could decrease to levels experienced during the past five years, which were well below historical averages. Any such development would have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s revenues, profitability and cash flows if sustained over a long period of time. 
Shipping is a business with inherent risks, and OSG&#8217;s insurance may not be adequate to cover its losses. 
OSG&#8217;s vessels and their cargoes are at risk of being damaged or lost because of events including, but not limited to:
In addition, transporting crude oil creates a risk of business interruptions due to political circumstances in foreign countries, hostilities, labor strikes, port closings and boycotts. These hazards may result in death or injury to persons; loss of revenues or property; the payment of ransoms; environmental damage; higher insurance rates; damage to OSG&#8217;s customer relationships; and market disruptions, delay or rerouting, which may also subject OSG to litigation. In addition, the operation of tankers has unique operational risks associated with the transportation of oil. An oil spill may cause significant environmental damage and the associated costs could exceed the insurance coverage available to the Company. Compared to other types of vessels, tankers are also exposed to a higher risk of damage and loss by fire, whether ignited by a terrorist attack, collision, or other cause, due to the high flammability and high volume of the oil transported in tankers. Any of these events could result in loss of revenues, decreased cash flows and increased costs.
While the Company carries insurance to protect against certain risks involved in the conduct of its business, risks may arise against which the Company is not adequately insured. For example, a catastrophic spill could exceed OSG&#8217;s $1 billion per vessel insurance coverage and have a material adverse effect on its operations. In addition, OSG may not be able to procure adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates in the future, and OSG cannot guarantee that any particular claim will be paid by its insurers. In the past, new and stricter environmental regulations have led to higher costs for insurance covering environmental damage or pollution, and new regulations could lead to similar increases or even make this type of insurance unavailable. Furthermore, even if insurance coverage is adequate to cover the Company&#8217;s losses, OSG may not be able to timely obtain a replacement ship in the event of a loss. OSG may also be subject to calls, or premiums, in amounts based not only on its own claim records but also the claim records of all other members of the protection and indemnity associations through which OSG obtains insurance coverage for tort liability. OSG&#8217;s payment of these calls could result in significant expenses which would reduce its profits and cash flows or cause losses.
Constraints on capital availability have adversely affected the tanker industry and OSG&#8217;s business. 
Constraints on capital that have occurred during recent years have adversely affected the financial condition of certain of the Company&#8217;s customers, joint venture partners, financial lenders and suppliers. Entities that suffer a material adverse impact on their financial condition may be unable or unwilling to comply with their contractual commitments to OSG including the refusal or inability of customers to pay charter hire to OSG or the inability or unwillingness of joint venture partners or financial lenders to honor their commitments to contribute funds to a joint venture or lend funds. While OSG seeks to monitor the financial condition of its customers, joint venture partners, financial lenders and suppliers, the availability and accuracy of information about the financial condition of such entities and the actions that OSG may take to reduce possible losses resulting from the failure of such entities to comply with their contractual obligations may be limited. Any such failure could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s revenues, profitability and cash flows. In addition, adverse financial conditions may inhibit these entities from entering into new commitments with OSG, which could also have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s revenues, profitability and cash flows.
The Company also faces other potential constraints on capital relating to counterparty credit risk and constraints on OSG&#8217;s ability to borrow funds. See also Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Company&#8212;The Company is subject to credit risks with respect to its counterparties on contracts and failure of such counterparties to meet their obligations could cause the Company to suffer losses on such contracts, decreasing revenues and earnings&#8221; and Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Company&#8212;OSG has incurred significant indebtedness which could affect its ability to finance its operations, pursue desirable business opportunities and successfully run its business in the future, all of which could affect OSG&#8217;s ability to fulfill its obligations under that indebtedness.&#8221;
OSG conducts its operations internationally, which subjects the Company to changing economic, political and governmental conditions abroad that may adversely affect its business. 
The Company conducts its operations internationally, and its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected by changing economic, political and government conditions in the countries and regions where its vessels are employed, including:
The occurrence of such events could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business. In addition, OSG&#8217;s international operations subject it to certain risks regarding taxation of foreign subsidiary income, see &#8220;&#8212;Risks related to our Company&#8212; OSG&#8217;s financial condition would be materially adversely affected if the shipping income of OSG&#8217;s foreign subsidiaries becomes subject to current taxation in the United States.&#8221;
OSG must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, anti-money laundering laws; and anti-competition regulations. Moreover, the shipping industry is generally considered to present elevated risks in these areas. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on the Company&#8217;s business operations and on the Company&#8217;s ability to transport cargo to one or more countries, and could also materially affect the Company&#8217;s brand, ability to attract and retain employees, international operations, business and operating results. Although OSG has policies and procedures designed to achieve compliance with these laws and regulations, OSG cannot be certain that its employees, contractors, joint venture partners or agents will not violate these policies and procedures.
Changes in fuel prices may adversely affect profits. 
Fuel is a significant, if not the largest, expense in the Company&#8217;s shipping operations when vessels are under voyage charter. Accordingly, an increase in the price of fuel may adversely affect the Company&#8217;s profitability if these increases cannot be passed onto customers. The price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside the Company&#8217;s control, including geopolitical developments; supply and demand for oil and gas; actions by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, and other oil and gas producers; war and unrest in oil producing countries and regions; regional production patterns; and environmental concerns. Fuel may become much more expensive in the future, which could reduce the profitability and competitiveness of the Company&#8217;s business compared to other forms of transportation.
Acts of piracy on ocean-going vessels could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business. 
The frequency of pirate attacks on seagoing vessels remains high, particularly in the western part of the Indian Ocean, off the west coast of Africa and in the South China Sea. If piracy attacks result in regions in which the Company&#8217;s vessels are deployed being characterized by insurers as &#8220;war risk&#8221; zones, as the Gulf of Aden has been, or Joint War Committee &#8220;war and strikes&#8221; listed areas, premiums payable for insurance coverage could increase significantly, and such insurance coverage may become difficult to obtain. Crew costs could also increase in such circumstances due to risks of piracy attacks.
In addition, while OSG believes the charterer remains liable for charter payments when a vessel is seized by pirates, the charterer may dispute this and withhold charter hire until the vessel is released. A charterer may also claim that a vessel seized by pirates was not &#8220;on-hire&#8221; for a certain number of days and it is therefore entitled to cancel the charter party, a claim the Company would dispute. The Company may not be adequately insured to cover losses from these incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, hijacking as a result of an act of piracy against the Company&#8217;s vessels, or an increase in the cost (or unavailability) of insurance for those vessels, could have a material adverse impact on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Such attacks may also impact the Company&#8217;s customers, which could impair their ability to make payments to the Company under its charters.
Terrorist attacks and international hostilities and instability can affect the tanker industry, which could adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business. 
Terrorist attacks, the outbreak of war, or the existence of international hostilities could damage the world economy, adversely affect the availability of and demand for crude oil and petroleum products and adversely affect both the Company&#8217;s ability to charter its vessels and the charter rates payable under any such charters. In addition, OSG operates in a sector of the economy that is likely to be adversely impacted by the effects of political instability, terrorist or other attacks, war or international hostilities. In the past, political instability has also resulted in attacks on vessels, mining of waterways and other efforts to disrupt international shipping, particularly in the Arabian Gulf region. These factors could also increase the costs to the Company of conducting its business, particularly crew, insurance and security costs, and prevent or restrict the Company from obtaining insurance coverage, all of which could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Risks Related to Our Company 
OSG has incurred significant indebtedness which could affect its ability to finance its operations, pursue desirable business opportunities and successfully run its business in the future, all of which could affect OSG&#8217;s ability to fulfill its obligations under that indebtedness. 
As of December 31, 2014, OSG had $1.67 billion of outstanding indebtedness. OSG&#8217;s substantial indebtedness and interest expense could have important consequences, including:
OSG&#8217;s ability to continue to fund its obligations and to reduce debt may be affected by general economic, financial market, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, among other things. An inability to fund the Company&#8217;s debt requirements or reduce debt could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Additionally, the actual or perceived credit quality of the Company&#8217;s charterers (as well as any defaults by them) could materially affect the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain the additional capital resources that it will require to purchase additional vessels or significantly increase the costs of obtaining such capital. The Company&#8217;s inability to obtain additional financing at a higher-than-anticipated cost, or at all, could materially affect the Company&#8217;s results of operation and its ability to implement its business strategy.
The Company may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of its indebtedness, and could in the future breach covenants in its credit facilities and term loans. 
The Company&#8217;s earnings, cash flow and the market value of its vessels vary significantly over time due to the cyclical nature of the tanker industry, as well as general economic and market conditions affecting the industry. As a result, the amount of debt that OSG can manage in some periods may not be appropriate in other periods and its ability to meet the financial covenants to which it is subject or may be subject in the future may vary. Additionally, future cash flow may be insufficient to meet the Company&#8217;s debt obligations and commitments. Any insufficiency could negatively impact OSG&#8217;s business.
Each Exit Financing Facility contains certain restrictions relating to new borrowings and, the movement of funds between the borrowers thereunder and OSG, as set forth in the respective loan agreements. In addition, the OIN Revolver Facility has a covenant to maintain the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Collateral Vessels (each as defined in that loan agreement) at greater than or equal to $500.0 million at the end of the each fiscal quarter. None of the other Exit Financing Facilities have financial covenants. Furthermore, drawdowns under the OBS ABL Facility borrowings are limited based upon the available borrowing base, as defined in that loan agreement and, if availability falls below a certain amount for a specified period of time, the administrative agent could exercise cash dominion rights permitting it to invoke control rights over certain of our accounts. While the Company was in compliance with these requirements as of December 31, 2014, a decrease in vessel values or a failure to meet this ratio could cause the Company to breach certain covenants in its existing credit facilities and term loans, or in future financing agreements that the Company may enter into from time to time. If the Company breaches such covenants and is unable to remedy the relevant breach or obtain a waiver, the Company&#8217;s lenders could accelerate its debt and foreclose on the Company&#8217;s owned vessels.
A range of economic, competitive, financial, business, industry and other factors will affect future financial performance, and, accordingly, the Company&#8217;s ability to generate cash flow from operations and to pay debt and to meet the financial covenants under the OIN Revolver Facility. Many of these factors, such as charter rates, economic and financial conditions in the tanker industry and the global economy or competitive initiatives of competitors, are beyond the Company&#8217;s control. If OSG does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy its debt obligations, it may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as:
Undertaking alternative financing plans, if necessary, might not allow OSG to meet its debt obligations. The Company&#8217;s ability to restructure or refinance its debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets, its access to such markets and its financial condition at that time. Any refinancing of debt could be at higher interest rates and might require the Company to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict OSG&#8217;s business operations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict OSG from adopting some of certain alternatives. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit OSG to meet its scheduled debt service obligations. The Company&#8217;s inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its debt obligations, to meet the covenants of its credit agreements and term loans and/or to obtain alternative financing in such circumstances, could materially and adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
The Company will be required to make additional capital expenditures to expand the number of vessels in its fleet and to maintain all of its vessels, which depend on additional financing. 
The Company&#8217;s business strategy is based in part upon the expansion of its fleet through the purchase of additional vessels at attractive points. If OSG is unable to fulfill its obligations under any memorandum of agreement or newbuilding construction contract for future vessel acquisitions, the sellers of such vessels may be permitted to terminate such contracts and the Company may be required to forfeit all or a portion of the down payments it made under such contracts and it may also be sued for any outstanding balance. In addition, as a newbuilding vessel must be drydocked within five years of its delivery from a shipyard, with survey cycles of no more than 60 months for the first three surveys, and 30 months thereafter, not including any unexpected repairs, the Company will incur significant maintenance costs for its existing and any newly-acquired vessels. As a result, if the Company does not utilize its vessels as planned, these maintenance costs could have material adverse effects on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
The Company depends on third party service providers for technical and commercial management of its International Flag fleet. 
The Company currently outsources to third party service providers certain management services of its International Flag fleet, including technical management, certain aspects of commercial management and crew management. In particular, the Company has entered into ship management agreements with V.Ships that assign technical management responsibilities to V.Ships for each vessel in the Company&#8217;s owned or bareboat chartered-in International Flag conventional tanker fleet (collectively, the &#8220;Ship Management Agreements&#8221;). The Company has also transferred commercial management of its International Flag conventional tanker fleet to certain other third party service providers, principally shipping pools.
In such outsourcing arrangements, the Company has transferred direct control over technical and commercial management of the relevant vessels and must rely on third party service providers to, among other things:
The third-party service providers the Company has selected may not provide a standard of service comparable to that the Company provided for such vessels prior to any outsourcing. Furthermore, damage to any such third party&#8217;s reputation, relationships or business may reflect on the Company directly or indirectly, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s reputation and business.
V.Ships has the right to terminate the Ship Management Agreements at any time with 90 days&#8217; notice. If V.Ships exercises that right, the Company will be required either to enter into substitute agreements with other third parties or to assume those management duties. The Company may not succeed in negotiating and entering into such agreements with other third parties and, even if it does so, the terms and conditions of such agreements may be less favorable to the Company. Furthermore, if the Company is required to dedicate internal resources to managing the International Flag conventional tanker fleet (including, but not limited to, hiring additional qualified personnel or diverting existing resources), that could result in increased costs and reduced efficiency and profitability. Any such changes could disrupt the Company&#8217;s business and have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition.
The contribution of the Company&#8217;s joint ventures to its profits and losses may fluctuate, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. 
The Company currently owns an interest in six of its vessels through two 50%-owned joint ventures, together with other third-party vessel owners and operators in the Company&#8217;s industry. See Item 1, &#8220;Business &#8211; Fleet Operations.&#8221; The Company&#8217;s ownership in these joint ventures is accounted for using the equity method, which means that the Company&#8217;s allocation of profits and losses of the applicable joint venture is included in its consolidated financial statements. The contribution of the Company&#8217;s joint ventures to the Company&#8217;s profits and losses may fluctuate, including the distributions that it may receive from such entities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
A joint venture involves certain risks such as:
If events relating to any of these risks were to come to pass, that could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s participation in the relevant joint venture, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
OSG&#8217;s business depends on spot charters, and any future decrease in spot charter rates could adversely affect its earnings. 
Voyage charters, including vessels operating in Commercial Pools that predominantly operate in the spot market, constituted 51% of OSG&#8217;s aggregate TCE revenues in 2014, 52% in 2013 and 64% in 2012. Accordingly, OSG&#8217;s shipping revenues are significantly affected by prevailing spot rates for voyage charters in the markets in which the Company&#8217;s vessels operate. The spot charter market may fluctuate significantly from time to time based upon tanker and oil supply and demand. For example, over the past five years, VLCC spot market rates (expressed as a time charter equivalent) have ranged from a high of $87,500 per day to negative values, and in December 2014 were $87,500 per day on the benchmark route between the Middle East Gulf and Japan. The successful operation of OSG&#8217;s vessels in the competitive spot charter market depends on, among other things, obtaining profitable spot charters and minimizing, to the extent possible, time spent waiting for charters and time spent traveling unladen to pick up cargo. The spot market is very volatile, and, in the past, there have been periods when spot charter rates have declined below the operating cost of vessels. If spot charter rates decline in the future, then OSG may be unable to operate its vessels trading in the spot market profitably, or meet its other obligations, including payments on indebtedness. Furthermore, as charter rates for spot charters are fixed for a single voyage, which may last up to several weeks during periods in which spot charter rates are rising or falling, OSG will generally experience delays in realizing the benefits from, or experiencing the detriments of those changes. See also Item 1, &#8220;Business&#8212;Operations&#8212;Charter Types.&#8221;
OSG may not be able to renew time charters when they expire or enter into new time charters for newbuilds. 
OSG&#8217;s ability to renew expiring contracts or obtain new charters will depend on the prevailing market conditions at the time of renewal. As of December 31, 2014, OSG employed 20 vessels on time charters, with four of those charters expiring in 2015, nine expiring in 2016, three expiring in 2017, three expiring in 2018 and two expiring in 2020 or thereafter. The Company&#8217;s existing time charters may not be renewed at comparable rates or if renewed or entered into, those new contracts may be at less favorable rates. In addition, there may be a gap in employment of vessels between current charters and subsequent charters. If at a time when OSG is seeking to arrange new charters for its vessels, market participants expect that less capacity will be necessary in the future (for example, if it is expected that oil and natural gas prices will decrease in the future, which could suggest that future oil and gas production levels will decline from then-current levels), OSG may not be able to obtain charters at attractive rates or at all. If, upon expiration of the existing time charters or delivery of newbuilds, OSG is unable to obtain time charters or voyage charters at desirable rates, the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.
Termination of, or a change in the nature of, OSG&#8217;s relationship with any of the pools in which it participates could adversely affect its business. 
As of December 31, 2014, all six of the Company&#8217;s VLCCs participate in the TI pool; four of OSG&#8217;s seven Aframaxes participate in the SIGMA pool; four of the Company&#8217;s eight crude Panamaxes and one of its two Panamax Product Carriers participate directly in the PI pool; nine of its MRs participate in the CPTA pool; five of its MRs participate in the HDT pool; and five of its MRs participate in the CPI pool (an aggregate of 19 MRs out of a total of 22). OSG&#8217;s participation in these pools is intended to enhance the financial performance of the Company&#8217;s vessels through higher vessel utilization. Any participant in any of these pools has the right to withdraw upon notice in accordance with the relevant pool agreement. Changes in the management of, and the terms of, these pools, decreases in the number of vessels participating in these pools, or the termination of these pools, could result in increased costs and reduced efficiency and profitability for the Company.
In addition, in recent years the EU has published guidelines on the application of the EU antitrust rules to traditional agreements for maritime services such as pools. While the Company believes that all the pools it participates in comply with EU rules, there has been limited administrative and judicial interpretation of the rules. Restrictive interpretations of the guidelines could adversely affect the ability to commercially market the respective types of vessels in pools.
In the highly competitive international market, OSG may not be able to compete effectively for charters. 
The Company&#8217;s vessels are employed in a highly competitive market. Competition arises from other vessel owners, including major oil companies, which may have substantially greater resources than OSG does. Competition for the transportation of crude oil and other petroleum products depends on price, location, size, age, condition, and the acceptability of the vessel operator to the charterer. The Company believes that because ownership of the world tanker fleet is highly fragmented, no single vessel owner is able to influence charter rates. To the extent OSG enters into new geographic regions or provides new services, it may not be able to compete profitably. New markets may involve competitive factors that differ from those of the Company&#8217;s current markets, and the competitors in those markets may have greater financial strength and capital resources than OSG does.
OSG may not realize the benefits it expects from past acquisitions or acquisitions it may make in the future. 
OSG&#8217;s business strategy includes ongoing efforts to engage in material acquisitions of ownership interests in entities in the tanker industry and of individual tankers. The success of OSG&#8217;s acquisitions will depend upon a number of factors, some of which may not be within its control. These factors include OSG&#8217;s ability to:
OSG intends to finance these acquisitions by using available cash from operations and through incurrence of debt or bridge financing, either of which may increase its leverage ratios, or by issuing equity, which may have a dilutive impact on its existing shareholders. At any given time OSG may be engaged in a number of discussions that may result in one or more acquisitions, some of which may be material to OSG as a whole. These opportunities require confidentiality and may involve negotiations that require quick responses by OSG. Although there can be no certainty that any of these discussions will result in definitive agreements or the completion of any transactions, the announcement of any such transaction may lead to increased volatility in the trading price of OSG&#8217;s securities.
Acquisitions can also involve a number of special risks and challenges, including:
The success of acquisitions or strategic investments depends on the effective integration of newly acquired businesses or assets into OSG&#8217;s current operations. Such integration is subject to risks and uncertainties, including realization of anticipated synergies and cost savings, the ability to retain and attract personnel and clients, the diversion of management&#8217;s attention from other business concerns, and undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of the acquired company or asset. OSG may not realize the strategic and financial benefits that it expects from any of its past acquisitions, or any future acquisitions. Further, if a portion of the purchase price of a business is attributable to goodwill and if the acquired business does not perform up to expectations at the time of the acquisition some or all of the goodwill may be written off, adversely affecting OSG&#8217;s earnings. We have recorded material write-offs of goodwill and intangible assets in prior years related to earlier acquisitions consummated by us.
Changes in demand in specialized markets in which the Company currently trades may lead the Company to redeploy certain vessels to other markets. 
The Company deploys its vessels in several specialized markets, including, without limitation, Lightering in the Delaware Bay. The Company conducts those Lightering operations with two articulated tug barges (&#8220;ATBs&#8221;) which were constructed using funds withdrawn from the Company&#8217;s CCF. If lower demand in these markets adversely affects the Company&#8217;s financial position, the Company may have to consider redeploying these two ATBs in other markets. If that occurs, the Company may not be able to compete profitably in the new markets, and the ATBs may not be able to be redeployed to new markets without substantial modification.
Operating costs and capital expenses will increase as the Company&#8217;s vessels age and may also increase due to unanticipated events relating to secondhand vessels and the consolidation of suppliers. 
In general, capital expenditures and other costs necessary for maintaining a vessel in good operating condition increase as the age of the vessel increases. As of December 31, 2014, the weighted average age of the Company&#8217;s total owned and operated fleet was 10.2 years. In addition, older vessels are typically less fuel-efficient than more recently constructed vessels due to improvements in engine technology. Cargo insurance rates are also expected to increase with the age of a vessel, since older vessels may be less desirable to charterers. Accordingly, it is likely that the operating costs of OSG&#8217;s currently operated vessels will increase. In addition, changes in governmental regulations and compliance with Classification Society standards may restrict the type of activities in which the vessels may engage and/or may require OSG to make additional expenditures for new equipment. In order to add such equipment, OSG may be required to take its vessels out of service. Market conditions may not justify such expenditures or permit OSG to operate its older vessels profitably even if those vessels remain operational.
In addition, the Company&#8217;s fleet includes a number of secondhand vessels. While the Company typically inspects secondhand vessels before it purchases them, those inspections do not necessarily provide OSG with the same level of knowledge about those vessels&#8217; condition that OSG would have had if these vessels had been built for and operated exclusively by it. The Company may not discover defects or other problems with such vessels before purchase, which may lead to expensive, unanticipated repairs, and could even result in accidents or other incidents for which the Company could be liable.
Furthermore, recent mergers have reduced the number of available suppliers, resulting in fewer alternatives for sourcing key supplies. With respect to certain items, OSG is generally dependent upon the original equipment manufacturer for repair and replacement of the item or its spare parts. Supplier consolidation may result in a shortage of supplies and services, thereby increasing the cost of supplies or potentially inhibiting the ability of suppliers to deliver on time. These cost increases or delays could result in downtime, and delays in the repair and maintenance of the Company&#8217;s vessels and FSOs and have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
The Company derives a substantial portion of its U.S. Flag segment&#8217;s revenue from a limited number of customers, and the loss of, or reduction in business by, any of these customers could materially adversely affect the U.S. Flag segment&#8217;s business, financial condition and results of operations. 
The U.S. Flag segment&#8217;s largest customers account for a significant portion of its revenues. The U.S. Flag segment&#8217;s top five customers comprised approximately 56% of the U.S. Flag segment&#8217;s revenues during 2014. The loss of, or reduction in business by, any of these customers could materially adversely affect the U.S. Flag segment&#8217;s business, financial condition and results of operations.
Certain potential customers will not use vessels older than a specified age, even if they have been subsequently rebuilt. 
All of the Company&#8217;s existing ATBs with the exception of the OSG Vision/OSG 350 and the OSG Horizon/OSG 351were originally constructed more than 25 years ago. While all of these tug-barge units were rebuilt and double-hulled since 1998 and are &#8220;in-class,&#8221; meaning the vessel has been certified by a Classification Society as being built and maintained in accordance with the rules of that Classification Society and complies with the applicable rules and regulations of the vessel&#8217;s country of registry and applicable international conventions, some potential customers have stated that they will not charter vessels that are more than 20 years old, even if they have been rebuilt. Other customers may not continue to view rebuilt vessels as suitable. If more customers differentiate rebuilt vessels, time charter rates for the Company&#8217;s rebuilt ATBs will likely be adversely affected or they may not be employable.
The Company&#8217;s significant operating leases could be replaced on less favorable terms or may not be replaced. 
The Company&#8217;s operating fleet includes 18 vessels that have been chartered-in under operating leases. The significant operating leases of the Company in its various businesses expire at various points in the future and may not be replaced at all or on as favorable terms, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s future financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
The Company is subject to credit risks with respect to its counterparties on contracts, and any failure by those counterparties to meet their obligations could cause the Company to suffer losses on such contracts, decreasing revenues and earnings. 
The Company has entered into, and in the future will enter into, various contracts, including charter agreements, joint venture agreements and other agreements associated with the operation of its vessels. The Company charters its vessels to other parties, who pay the Company a daily rate of hire. The Company also enters COAs and Voyage Charters. Historically, the Company has not experienced material problems collecting charter hire but the global economic downturn of recent years has affected charterers more severely than the prior recessions that have occurred since the Company&#8217;s establishment more than 45 years ago. The Company also time charters or bareboat charters some of its vessels from other parties and its continued use and operation of such vessels depends on the vessel owners&#8217; compliance with the terms of the time charter or bareboat charter. Additionally, the Company enters into derivative contracts (interest rate swaps and caps) from time to time. As a result, the Company is subject to credit risks. The ability of each of the Company&#8217;s counterparties to perform its obligations under a contract with it will depend on a number of factors that are beyond the Company&#8217;s control and may include, among other things, general economic conditions; availability of debt or equity financing; the condition of the maritime and offshore industries; the overall financial condition of the counterparty; charter rates received for specific types of vessels; and various expenses. Charterers are sensitive to the commodity markets and may be impacted by market forces affecting commodities such as oil. In addition, in depressed market conditions, the Company&#8217;s charterers and customers may no longer need a vessel that is currently under charter or contract or may be able to obtain a comparable vessel at lower rates. As a result, the Company&#8217;s customers may fail to pay charter hire or attempt to renegotiate charter rates. If the counterparties fail to meet their obligations, the Company could suffer losses on such contracts which would decrease revenues, cash flows and earnings.
The counterparty to OSG&#8217;s largest Delaware Bay Lightering contract has approached the Company about restructuring the contract to lower the minimum volumes contained therein and has indicated that the termination or reduction payment that they would be required to make under the terms of the underlying contract would pose an unreasonable economic burden. If the counterparty fails to comply with the terms of the existing long-term contract, including provisions requiring that compensation be paid to the Company under certain circumstances, and OSG is unable to obtain replacement time charters at desirable rates, the Company&#8217;s profitability and cash flows may be adversely affected.
We cannot be certain that the bankruptcy proceedings will not adversely affect our operations going forward. 
We emerged from bankruptcy on August 5, 2014. The full extent to which our bankruptcy will impact our business operations, reputation and relationships with our customers, employees, regulators and agents may not be known for some time and could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition and results of operations.
The Company depends on its key personnel and may have difficulty attracting and retaining skilled employees. 
OSG&#8217;s success depends to a significant extent upon the abilities and efforts of its key personnel. The loss of the services of key personnel or the Company&#8217;s inability to attract, motivate and retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, all of the Company&#8217;s seven executive officers have served in their current positions for less than nine months and all the members of the Board were first elected in August 2014.
Work stoppages or other labor disruptions by the unionized employees of OSG or other companies in related industries may adversely affect OSG&#8217;s operations. 
As of December 31, 2014, OSG had 890 regular full-time employees, of which 632 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions. See Item 1, &#8220;Business &#8211; Employees.&#8221; In addition, OSG relies on the services of third parties who employ persons covered by collective bargaining agreements. OSG could be adversely affected by actions taken by employees of OSG or other companies in related industries (including third parties providing services to OSG) against efforts by management to control labor costs, restrain wage or benefits increases or modify work practices or the failure of OSG or other companies in its industry to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements.
The Company may face unexpected drydock costs for its vessels. 
Vessels must be drydocked periodically. For example, the U.S. Coast Guard requires the Company&#8217;s vessels to be drydocked for inspection and maintenance twice every five years. The cost of repairs and renewals required at each drydock are difficult to predict with certainty, can be substantial and the Company&#8217;s insurance does not cover these costs. In addition, vessels may have to be drydocked in the event of accidents or other unforeseen damage, and OSG&#8217;s insurance may not cover all of these costs. Vessels in drydock will generally not generate any income. Large drydocking expenses could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the time when a vessel is out of service for maintenance is determined by a number of factors including regulatory deadlines, market conditions, shipyard availability and customer requirements, and accordingly the length of time that a vessel may be off-hire may be longer than anticipated, which could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Technological innovation could reduce the Company&#8217;s charter income and the value of the Company&#8217;s vessels. 
The charter rates and the value and operational life of a vessel are determined by a number of factors including the vessel&#8217;s efficiency, operational flexibility and physical life. Efficiency includes speed, fuel economy and the ability to load and discharge cargo quickly. Flexibility includes the ability to enter harbors, utilize related docking facilities and pass through canals and straits. The length of a vessel&#8217;s physical life is related to its original design and construction, its maintenance and the impact of the stress of operations. If new tankers are built that are more efficient or more flexible or have longer physical lives than the Company&#8217;s vessels, competition from these more technologically advanced vessels could adversely affect the amount of charter payments the Company receives for its vessels once their initial charters expire and the resale value of the Company&#8217;s vessels could significantly decrease. As a result, the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.
Interruption or failure of OSG&#8217;s information technology and communications systems could impair its ability to operate and adversely affect its business. 
OSG is highly dependent on information technology systems. These dependencies include accounting, billing, disbursement, cargo booking and tracking, vessel scheduling and stowage, equipment tracking, customer service, banking, payroll and communication systems. Information technology and communication systems are subject to reliability issues, integration and compatibility concerns, and security-threatening intrusions. OSG may experience failures caused by the occurrence of a natural disaster, computer hacking or viruses or other unanticipated problems at OSG&#8217;s facilities, aboard its vessels or at third-party locations. Any failure of OSG&#8217;s or third-party systems could result in interruptions in service, reductions in its revenue and profits, damage to its reputation or liability for the release of confidential information.
A portion of OSG&#8217;s revenues are subject to seasonal variations. 
OSG operates its tankers in markets that have historically exhibited seasonal variations in demand for tanker capacity, and therefore, charter rates. Peaks in tanker demand quite often precede seasonal oil consumption peaks, as refiners and suppliers anticipate consumer demand. Charter rates for tankers are typically higher in the fall and winter months as a result of increased oil consumption in the Northern Hemisphere. Unpredictable weather patterns and variations in oil reserves disrupt tanker scheduling. Because a majority of the Company&#8217;s vessels trade in the spot market, seasonality has affected OSG&#8217;s operating results on a quarter-to-quarter basis and could continue to do so in the future. Such seasonality may be outweighed in any period by then current economic conditions or tanker industry fundamentals.
Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters 
The Company&#8217;s business would be adversely affected if it failed to comply with the Jones Act&#8217;s limitations on U.S. coastwise trade, or if these limitations were waived, modified or repealed, or if changes in international trade agreements were to occur. 
Certain of the Company&#8217;s U.S. Flag operations are conducted in the U.S. coastwise trade and are governed by U.S. federal laws commonly known as the &#8220;Jones Act&#8221;. The Jones Act restricts waterborne transportation of goods between points in the United States to vessels meeting certain requirements, including ownership and control by &#8220;U.S. Citizens&#8221; as defined thereunder (as so defined, &#8220;U.S. Citizens&#8221;). The Company is responsible for monitoring the foreign ownership of its common stock and other interests to ensure compliance with the Jones Act. The Company could lose the privilege of owning and operating vessels in the Jones Act trade if non-U.S. Citizens were to own or control, in the aggregate, more than 25% of the equity interests in the Company. Such loss would have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business and results of operations. In addition, under certain circumstances failure to comply with the Jones Act may result in the Company being deemed to have violated other U.S. federal laws that prohibit a foreign transfer of U.S. documented vessels without government approval, resulting in severe penalties, including permanent loss of U.S. coastwise trading privileges or forfeiture of the vessels deemed transferred, and fines.
Additionally, maritime transportation services are currently excluded from the General Agreement on Trade in Services (&#8220;GATS&#8221;) and are the subject of reservations by the United States in the North American Free Trade Agreement (&#8220;NAFTA&#8221;) and other international free trade agreements. If maritime transportation services were included in GATS, NAFTA or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise repealed or altered, the transportation of maritime cargo between U.S. ports could be opened to international flag or foreign built vessels. During the past several years, interest groups have lobbied Congress, and legislation has been introduced, to repeal certain provisions of the Jones Act to facilitate international flag competition for trades and cargoes currently reserved for U.S. Flag vessels under the Jones Act. The Company expects that continued efforts will be made to modify or repeal the Jones Act. Because international vessels may have lower construction costs, wage rates and operating costs, this could significantly increase competition in the coastwise trade, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
Governments could requisition the Company&#8217;s vessels during a period of war or emergency, which may negatively impact the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and available cash. 
A government could requisition one or more of the Company&#8217;s vessels for title or hire. Requisition for title occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and becomes the owner. Requisition for hire occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and effectively becomes the charterer at dictated charter rates. Generally, requisitions occur during a period of war or emergency. In addition, two OSG vessels participate in the U.S. Maritime Security Program, which ensures that militarily useful U.S. Flag vessels are available to the U.S. Department of Defense in the event of war or national emergency. These vessels are required to trade outside the United States but are eligible for government-sponsored business. Under the program, OSG receives an annual fee, subject in each case to annual Congressional appropriations, in exchange for a guarantee that the ships will be made available to the U.S. government in the time of war or national emergency. Government requisition of one or more of the Company&#8217;s vessels may negatively impact the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and available cash.
The Company&#8217;s vessels may be directed to call on ports located in countries that are subject to restrictions imposed by the U.S. government, which could negatively affect the trading price of the Company&#8217;s common shares. 
From time to time, certain of the Company&#8217;s vessels, on the instructions of the charterers or pool manager responsible for the commercial management of such vessels, have called and may again call on ports located in countries or territories, and/or operated by persons, subject to sanctions and embargoes imposed by the U.S. government, the United Nations (&#8220;UN&#8221;) or the EU and countries identified by the U.S. government, the UN or the EU as state sponsors of terrorism. The U.S., UN and EU sanctions and embargo laws and regulations vary in their application, as they do not all apply to the same covered persons or proscribe the same activities, and such sanctions and embargo laws and regulations may be amended or expanded over time. Some sanctions may also apply to transportation of goods (including crude oil) originating in sanctioned countries (particularly Iran), even if the vessel does not travel to those countries, or otherwise acting on behalf of sanctioned persons. Sanctions may include the imposition of penalties and fines against companies violating national law or companies acting outside the jurisdiction of the sanctioning power themselves becoming the target of sanctions.
Although OSG believes that it is in compliance with all applicable sanctions and embargo laws and regulations and intends to maintain such compliance, and OSG does not, and does not intend to, engage in sanctionable activity, OSG might fail to comply or may engage in a sanctionable activity in the future, particularly as the scope of certain laws may be unclear and may be subject to changing interpretations. Any such violation or sanctionable activity could result in fines or other penalties, or the imposition of sanctions against the Company, and could result in some investors deciding, or being required, to divest their interest, or not to invest, in the Company and negatively affect OSG&#8217;s reputation and investor perception of the value of OSG&#8217;s common stock.
Compliance with complex laws, regulations, and, in particular, environmental laws or regulations, including those relating to the emission of greenhouse gases, may adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business. 
The Company&#8217;s operations are affected by extensive and changing international, national and local environmental protection laws, regulations, treaties, conventions and standards in force in international waters, the jurisdictional waters of the countries in which OSG&#8217;s vessels operate, as well as the countries of its vessels&#8217; registration. Many of these requirements are designed to reduce the risk of oil spills. They also regulate other water pollution issues, including discharge of ballast water and effluents and air emissions, including emission of greenhouse gases. These requirements impose significant capital and operating costs on OSG, including, without limitation, ones related to engine adjustments and ballast water treatment.
Environmental laws and regulations also can affect the resale value or significantly reduce the useful lives of the Company&#8217;s vessels, require a reduction in carrying capacity, ship modifications or operational changes or restrictions (and related increased operating costs) or retirement of service, lead to decreased availability or higher cost of insurance coverage for environmental matters or result in the denial of access to, or detention in, certain jurisdictional waters or ports. Under local, national and foreign laws, as well as international treaties and conventions, OSG could incur material liabilities, including cleanup obligations, in the event that there is a release of petroleum or other hazardous substances from its vessels or otherwise in connection with its operations. OSG could also become subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to the release of or exposure to hazardous materials associated with its current or historic operations. Violations of or liabilities under environmental requirements also can result in substantial penalties, fines and other sanctions, including in certain instances, seizure or detention of the Company&#8217;s vessels.
OSG could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs, fines, penalties, third-party claims and natural resource damages, as the result of an oil spill or liabilities under environmental laws. The Company is subject to the oversight of several government agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Maritime Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation. OPA 90 affects all vessel owners shipping oil or hazardous material to, from or within the United States. OPA 90 allows for potentially unlimited liability without regard to fault for owners, operators and bareboat charterers of vessels for oil pollution in U.S. waters. Similarly, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, as amended, which has been adopted by most countries outside of the United States, imposes liability for oil pollution in international waters. OPA 90 expressly permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to hazardous materials and oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries. Coastal states in the United States have enacted pollution prevention liability and response laws, many providing for unlimited liability. Similarly, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, as amended, which has been adopted by most countries outside of the United States, imposes liability for oil pollution in international waters.
In addition, in complying with OPA 90, IMO regulations, EU directives and other existing laws and regulations and those that may be adopted, shipowners likely will incur substantial additional capital and/or operating expenditures in meeting new regulatory requirements, in developing contingency arrangements for potential spills and in obtaining insurance coverage. Key regulatory initiatives that are anticipated to require substantial additional capital and/or operating expenditures in the next several years include more stringent limits on the sulfur content of fuel oil for vessels operating in certain areas and more stringent requirements for management and treatment of ballast water. See Item 1, &#8220;Business &#8212; Environmental and Security Matters Relating to Bulk Shipping.&#8221; Other government regulation of vessels, particularly in the areas of safety and environmental requirements, can be expected to become more strict in the future and require the Company to incur significant capital expenditures on its vessels to keep them in compliance, or even to scrap or sell certain vessels altogether. Such expenditures could result in financial and operational impacts that may be material to OSG&#8217;s financial statements. Additionally, the failure of a shipowner or bareboat charterer to comply with local, domestic and foreign regulations may subject it to increased liability, may invalidate existing insurance or decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports. For example, in February 2015, the U.S. Coast Guard personnel detained the tanker Overseas Jademar in Port Angeles, Washington for violation of safety regulations, which included non-functioning distress signaling equipment and fire safety systems. If any of our vessels are denied access to, or are detained in, certain ports, reputation, business, financial results and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.
Accidents involving highly publicized oil spills and other mishaps involving vessels can be expected in the tanker industry, and such accidents or other events could be expected to result in the adoption of even stricter laws and regulations, which could limit the Company&#8217;s operations or its ability to do business and which could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial results and cash flows. In addition, the Company is required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain certain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to its operations. The Company believes its vessels are maintained in good condition in compliance with present regulatory requirements, are operated in compliance with applicable safety and environmental laws and regulations and are insured against usual risks for such amounts as the Company&#8217;s management deems appropriate. The vessels&#8217; operating certificates and licenses are renewed periodically during each vessel&#8217;s required annual survey. However, government regulation of tankers, particularly in the areas of safety and environmental impact may change in the future and require the Company to incur significant capital expenditures with respect to its ships to keep them in compliance.
Due to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries, including the United States, and international organizations, including the EU, the IMO and the UN, have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These regulatory measures include, among others, adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. Such actions could result in significant financial and operational impacts on the Company&#8217;s business, including requiring OSG to install new emission controls, acquire allowances or pay taxes related to its greenhouse gas emissions, or administer and manage a greenhouse gas emission program. See Item 1, &#8220;Business &#8212; Environmental and Security Matters Relating to Bulk Shipping.&#8221; In addition to the added costs, the concern over climate change and regulatory measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may reduce global demand for oil and oil products, which would have an adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial results and cash flows.
The Company may be subject to litigation and government inquiries or investigations that, if not resolved in the Company&#8217;s favor and not sufficiently covered by insurance, could have a material adverse effect on it. 
The Company has been and is, from time to time, involved in various litigation matters and subject to government inquiries and investigations. These matters may include, among other things, regulatory proceedings and litigation arising out of or relating to matters related to the restatement of the Company&#8217;s financial statements in 2012, contract disputes, personal injury claims, environmental claims or proceedings, asbestos and other toxic tort claims, employment matters, governmental claims for taxes or duties, and other disputes that arise in the ordinary course of the Company&#8217;s business. In particular, the Company is subject to an investigation by the SEC&#8217;s Division of Enforcement related to tax issues raised in the Company&#8217;s October 22, 2012 Form 8-K, and the SEC filed a proof of claim against the Company in the Bankruptcy Court in connection with that investigation. To the extent this claim is allowed by the Bankruptcy Court, the Equity Plan provides a maximum reserve of up to $5 million as the exclusive source from which to satisfy any liabilities on account of that claim. In the event that the SEC asserts separate claims against individuals affiliated with the Company, liabilities associated with such claims are not included in this reserve, and any such liabilities not covered by insurance may be subject to reimbursement by the Company, subject to the terms of the Equity Plan. Additionally, there are a number of pending lawsuits alleging injuries related to purported asbestos exposure in various state and federal courts, as well as certain proofs of claim alleging such exposure pending before the Bankruptcy Court. The Company believes it has insurance coverage for the majority, though not all, of these cases.
Although the Company intends to defend these matters vigorously, it cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any such matter, and the ultimate outcome of these matters or the potential costs to resolve them could involve or result in significant expenditures or losses by the Company, or result in significant changes to OSG&#8217;s tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s future operating results, including profitability, cash flows, and financial condition. Insurance may not be applicable or sufficient in all cases and/or insurers may not remain solvent which may have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s financial condition. The Company&#8217;s recorded liabilities and estimates of reasonably possible losses for its contingent liabilities are based on its assessment of potential liability using the information available to the Company at the time and, as applicable, any past experience and trends with respect to similar matters. However, because litigation is inherently uncertain, the Company&#8217;s estimates for contingent liabilities may be insufficient to cover the actual liabilities from such claims, resulting in a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See &#8220;Item 3 &#8212; Legal Proceedings&#8221; and Note 21, &#8220;Contingencies,&#8221; to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements included in &#8220;Item 8 &#8212; Financial Statement and Supplementary Data.&#8221;
We may be subject to claims that were not discharged in the Chapter 11 Petitions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability .
Substantially all of the claims against us that arose prior to our emergence from bankruptcy were resolved during our Chapter 11 Petitions or are in the process of being resolved in the Bankruptcy Court as part of the claims reconciliation process. Although we anticipate that the remaining claims will be handled in due course with no material adverse effect to our business, financial operations or financial conditions, we cannot assure you that this will be the case or that the resolution of such claims will occur in a timely manner or at all. Subject to certain exceptions, and as set forth in the Plan, all claims against and interests in us and our subsidiaries that filed for Chapter 11 and which arose prior to our emergence from bankruptcy are (1) subject to the compromise and/or treatment provided for in the Plan and/or (2) discharged in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code, the terms of the Plan, and the Bankruptcy Court&#8217;s order confirming the Plan (the &#8220;Confirmation Order&#8221;). Pursuant to the terms of the Plan, the provisions of the Plan constitute a good faith compromise or settlement, or resolution of all such claims and the Confirmation Order, as well as other orders resolving objections to claims, constitute the Bankruptcy Court&#8217;s approval of the compromise settlement, or resolution arrived at with respect to all such claims. Circumstances in which claims and other obligations that arose prior to our emergence from bankruptcy may not have been discharged include instances where the Plan provides for reinstatement of such claims, or where a claimant had inadequate notice of the bankruptcy filing. As such, some parties whose claims were expunged during the bankruptcy or discharged by the Plan and Confirmation Order may seek to re-assert their claims in state or federal court. While the terms of the Plan and the Bankruptcy Court&#8217;s orders generally foreclose that reassertion, there are limited instances, such as where a court finds an insufficient notice of the bankruptcy, in which a plaintiff may be able to proceed despite an expungement or discharge. In that event, the continuation of such a lawsuit could have a material adverse effect.
The smuggling of drugs or other contraband onto the Company&#8217;s vessels may lead to governmental claims against the Company. 
The Company expects that its vessels will call in ports where smugglers attempt to hide drugs and other contraband on vessels, with or without the knowledge of crew members. To the extent the Company&#8217;s vessels are found with contraband, whether inside or attached to the hull of our vessel and whether with or without the knowledge of any of its crew, we may face governmental or other regulatory claims which could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Maritime claimants could arrest OSG&#8217;s vessels, which could interrupt cash flows. 
Crew members, suppliers of goods and services to a vessel, shippers of cargo and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against that vessel for unsatisfied debts, claims or damages. In many jurisdictions, a maritime lien holder may enforce its lien by arresting a vessel through foreclosure proceedings. The arrest or attachment of one or more of the Company&#8217;s vessels could interrupt OSG&#8217;s cash flow and require it to pay a significant amount of money to have the arrest lifted. In addition, in some jurisdictions, such as South Africa, under the &#8220;sister ship&#8221; theory of liability, a claimant may arrest both the vessel that is subject to the claimant&#8217;s maritime lien and any &#8220;associated&#8221; vessel, meaning any vessel owned or controlled by the same owner. Claimants could try to assert &#8220;sister ship&#8221; liability against one vessel in the Company&#8217;s fleet for claims relating to another vessel in its fleet which, if successful, could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
The Company&#8217;s U.S. federal income tax position in respect of certain credit agreement borrowings used by OIN is not free from doubt. 
The Company has taken the position that certain drawdowns by the Company under the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility used solely by OIN should not be taken into account in determining amounts includible in OSG&#8217;s income as deemed dividends under section 951(a)(1)(B) and section 956 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for taxable years 2013 and earlier. Although the Company believes that it has a strong basis for taking this position, there is no authority directly on point and the Company has established a reserve in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 740. If the IRS were to challenge the Company&#8217;s position, the Company&#8217;s total cash exposure could exceed the reserve, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
The Company has recognized tax benefits but certain of these items may be subject to audit and material adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service. 
The Company currently plans to treat certain payments made by Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. in connection with the Company&#8217;s emergence from bankruptcy as having been made in its capacity as guarantor of the obligations of subsidiaries of OSG International, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company incorporated in the Marshall Islands, arising under certain loan agreements and deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. In connection with these payments, the Company has recorded a tax benefit; however, due to significant uncertainty as to whether the IRS will agree with the Company&#8217;s position on the deductibility of those payments, or instead take the position that those payments gave rise to a non-deductible capital contribution, the Company has established a reserve in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 740 to fully offset the benefit. Certain of these items may be subject to audit and material adjustment by the IRS.
Transfers or issuances of the Company&#8217;s equity may impair or reduce the Company&#8217;s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes in the future. 
Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, contain rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an &#8220;ownership change&#8221; to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change. An &#8220;ownership change&#8221; is generally defined as any change in ownership of more than 50% of a corporation&#8217;s stock over a rolling three-year period by stockholders that own (directly or indirectly) 5% or more of the stock of a corporation, or arising from a new issuance of stock by a corporation. If an ownership change occurs, Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the use of pre-ownership change NOLs, credits and certain other tax attributes to offset taxable income earned after the ownership change. The annual limitation is equal to the product of the applicable long-term tax exempt rate and the value of the company&#8217;s stock immediately before the ownership change. This annual limitation may be adjusted to reflect any unused annual limitation for prior years and certain recognized built-in gains and losses for the year. In addition, Section 383 generally limits the amount of tax liability in any post-ownership change year that can be reduced by pre-ownership change tax credit carryforwards. If the Company were to undergo an &#8220;ownership change,&#8221; it could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
OSG&#8217;s financial condition would be materially adversely affected if the shipping income of OSG&#8217;s foreign subsidiaries becomes subject to current taxation in the United States. 
As a result of changes made by the American Jobs Creations Act of 2004 (&#8220;2004 Act&#8221;), the Company does not include in its U.S. tax return on a current basis the unrepatriated shipping income earned by its international flag vessels, which in recent years represented substantially all of the Company&#8217;s pre-tax income. These changes in the 2004 Act were made to make U.S.-controlled shipping companies competitive with foreign-controlled shipping companies, which are generally incorporated in jurisdictions in which they either do not pay income taxes or pay minimal income taxes. The taxation of OSG&#8217;s foreign subsidiaries under U.S. laws is a complex area and is subject to ongoing analysis and recalculation, which can have a material impact on the Company. See Note 13, &#8220;Taxes,&#8221; to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statement and Supplementary Data.&#8221;
The President and several Congressmen and Senators have announced support for repealing certain tax provisions that purportedly incentivize companies to move jobs from the United States to foreign countries. While the Company believes that the changes made in the 2004 Act with respect to foreign shipping income do not &#8220;incentivize moving jobs offshore,&#8221; and, in fact, have enabled the Company to expand its U.S. Flag fleet and create jobs in the United States, Congress may decide to repeal the changes made in the 2004 Act with respect to taxation of foreign shipping income for the aforementioned reason or as part of initiatives to reduce the U.S. budget deficit or to reform the U.S. corporate tax regime. Such repeal, either directly or indirectly by limiting or reducing benefits received under the 2004 Act, could have a materially adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial results and cash flows.
Risks Related to the Common Stock and Warrants 
The market price of the Company&#8217;s securities may fluctuate significantly .
The market price of the Company&#8217;s securities may fluctuate substantially. You may not be able to resell your Class A or Class B Common Stock or Class A or Class B Warrants at or above the price you paid for such securities due to a number of factors, some of which are beyond the Company&#8217;s control. These risks include those described or referred to in this &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section and under &#8220;Forward &#8211;Looking Statements,&#8221; as well as, among other things: fluctuations in the Company&#8217;s operating results; activities of and results of operations of the Company&#8217;s competitors; changes in the Company&#8217;s relationships with the Company&#8217;s customers or the Company&#8217;s vendors; changes in business or regulatory conditions; changes in the Company&#8217;s capital structure; any announcements by the Company or its competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic alliances or joint ventures; additions or departures of key personnel; investors&#8217; general perception of the Company; failure to meet market expectations; future sales of the Company&#8217;s securities by it, directors, executives and significant stockholders; changes in domestic and international economic and political conditions; and other events or factors, including those resulting from natural disasters, war, acts of terrorism or responses to these events.
In addition, the stock market has recently experienced volatility that, in some cases, has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the Company&#8217;s securities, regardless of its actual operating performance. 
The Company&#8217;s stock and warrants are thinly traded, and your ability to sell such securities may be limited. 
The Company&#8217;s Class A Common Stock and Class A Warrants are currently traded as &#8220;restricted securities&#8221; in the over-the-counter market and in privately negotiated transactions among individual holders pursuant to exemptions from the Securities Act of 1933. Transactions are reported as taking place only sporadically. Certain broker-dealers report quotes for the purchase and sale of Class A Common Stock and Class A Warrants. While the Company intends to apply for listing of the Class A Common Stock and Class A Warrants on the New York Stock Exchange (&#8220;NYSE&#8221;) at such time as it meets the NYSE&#8217;s listing requirements, the Company may not be able to qualify for listing, and a more liquid market may never be developed or maintained. The Company cannot assure you as to the liquidity of any market that may develop for the Class A Common Stock and Class A Warrants, your ability to sell your Class A Common Stock and Class A Warrants or the price at which you would be able to sell such securities.
In addition, the Company&#8217;s Class B Common Stock is listed on NYSE MKT. However, trading volume has been relatively low. Low levels of liquidity may make it difficult for you to sell your Class B Common Stock at any particular time.
The exercise of outstanding warrants may result in substantial dilution to the Company&#8217;s stockholders. 
As of March 2, 2015, the Company had outstanding:
Collectively, if exercised, the shares of common stock underlying these warrants would represent approximately 40.3% of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common stock following such exercise. Accordingly, any such exercise would result in substantial dilution to the Company&#8217;s stockholders.
The Company&#8217;s common stock is subject to restrictions on foreign ownership, which could have a negative impact on the transferability of the Company&#8217;s common stock, its liquidity and market value, and on a change of control of the Company. 
The Company&#8217;s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws authorize its Board of Directors to establish with respect to any class or series of capital stock of the Company certain rules, policies and procedures, including procedures with respect to transfer of shares, to assist in monitoring and maintaining compliance with the Jones Act ownership restrictions. In order to provide a reasonable margin for compliance with the Jones Act, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors has determined that until further action by it, at least 77% (the &#8220;Minimum Percentage&#8221;) of the outstanding shares of each class of capital stock of the Company must be owned by U.S. Citizens. Moreover, the Company&#8217;s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws provide that any purported transfer of equity interests in the Company that caused the percentage of outstanding shares of a class of capital stock of the Company to fall below the Minimum Percentage will be ineffective to transfer the equity interests or any voting, dividend or other rights associated with such interests.
The percentage of U.S. citizenship ownership of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common stock fluctuates based on daily trading, and at times in the past has declined to the Minimum Percentage. At and during such time that the Minimum Percentage is reached with respect to outstanding shares of a class of the Company&#8217;s stock, the Company is unable to issue any further shares of such class of common stock or approve transfers of such class of common stock to non-U.S. Citizens among other things. The existence and enforcement of these ownership restrictions could have an adverse impact on the liquidity or market value of the Company&#8217;s equity securities. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, the ownership restrictions could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of the Company.
The Company&#8217;s outstanding warrants are not subject to the above ownership restrictions, but the warrants include provisions limiting the right of non-U.S. Citizens to exercise warrants if the shares of common stock that would be issued upon exercise would cause the percentage of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common stock held by U.S. Citizens to decline below the Minimum Percentage.
The Company does not currently intend to pay cash dividends on its securities for the foreseeable future . 
The Company currently does not intend to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of the Company&#8217;s board of directors and will depend on, among other things, its results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law or the SEC and other factors that the Company&#8217;s board of directors may deem relevant.
Some provisions of Delaware law and the Company&#8217;s governing documents could influence its ability to effect a change of control. 
Certain provisions of Delaware law and contained in the Company&#8217;s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of the Company. In addition, these provisions could make it more difficult to bring about a change in the composition of the Company&#8217;s board of directors. For example, the Company&#8217;s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws:
These and other provisions of the Company&#8217;s organizational documents and Delaware law may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing changes of control or changes in management, even if such transactions or changes would have significant benefits for its stockholders. As a result, these provisions could limit the price some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock.
Separately, the Company has elected to opt out of Section 203 (&#8220;Section 203&#8221;) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the &#8220;DGCL&#8221;), which restricts certain business combinations between a Delaware corporation and an &#8220;interested stockholder.&#8221; Accordingly, the Company will be able to enter into such transactions with its principal stockholders without complying with the requirements of Section 203. The election to opt out of Section 203 could deprive certain stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of the Company, particularly if it enters into a transaction with an &#8220;interested stockholder.&#8221;

The following important risk factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements made in this report or presented elsewhere by management from time to time. If any of the circumstances or events described below actually arise or occur, the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Actual dollar amounts are used in this Item 1 A. &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section. 
Chapter 11 Cases specific risk factors: 
On November 14, 2012, the Company and 180 of its direct and indirect subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the &#8220;Bankruptcy Code&#8221; or &#8220;Chapter 11&#8221;) in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the &#8220;Bankruptcy Court&#8221;), which are being jointly administered under docket number 12-20000 (the &#8220;Chapter 11 Cases&#8221;). The Company and its filing subsidiaries will continue to operate as &#8220;debtors in possession&#8221; in the ordinary course under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. See Note 2, &#8220;Bankruptcy Filing and Going Concern,&#8221; and Note 11, &#8220;Debt,&#8221; to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; for a further discussion regarding the impact of the Chapter 11 filing on the Company&#8217;s debt agreements. 
The Chapter 11 Cases are intended to permit the Company to reorganize and improve liquidity, resolve material tax and other claims and emerge with a stronger balance sheet. On March 7, 2014, the Company filed with the Bankruptcy Court a plan of reorganization of the Company (the &#8220;Plan&#8221;) that the Company believes meets the standards for confirmation under the Bankruptcy Code. On the effective date of the Plan, the reorganized Company will emerge from bankruptcy in its present corporate structure (the &#8220;Reorganized OSG&#8221;). Confirmation of the Plan could materially alter the classifications and amounts reported in the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements, which do not give effect to any adjustments to the carrying values of assets or amounts of liabilities that might be necessary as a consequence of confirmation of the Plan or the effect of any operational changes that may be implemented. 
The Plan provides, among other things, that creditors&#8217; allowed non-subordinated claims against the Company other than claims under (i) the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility and (ii) the 2018 and 2024 Unsecured Senior Notes will be paid in full, in cash, including post-petition interest. Holders of shares of common stock and allowed claims subordinated pursuant to section 510(b) of the Bankruptcy Code would receive a combination of Reorganized OSG Stock and Reorganized OSG Jones Act Warrants valued at $61.4 million subject to dilution on account of a management and director incentive program (under which Reorganized OSG may issue up to 10% of the Reorganized OSG Stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis) and a $300 million rights offering of Reorganized OSG Stock and Reorganized OSG Jones Act Warrants. Holders of claims under the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility will receive their pro rata share of the Reorganized OSG Stock and Reorganized OSG Jones Act Warrants. The 2018 and 2024 Unsecured Senior Notes will be reinstated following payment of outstanding interest. 
The Company and the Consenting Lenders holding an aggregate of approximately 72% of amounts outstanding under the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility have entered into a plan support agreement dated February 12, 2014 (the &#8220;Plan Support Agreement&#8221;) under which the Consenting Lenders have agreed to support and vote in favor of the Plan. 
The Company&#8217;s filing of the Chapter 11 Cases and the Company&#8217;s ability to successfully emerge as a stronger, leaner company may be affected by a number of risks and uncertainties. 
The Company is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties associated with the filing of voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, which may lead to potential adverse effects on the Company&#8217;s liquidity, results of operations or business prospects. While the Company has filed the Plan with the Bankruptcy Court, no assurance can be given as to the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases. Risks associated with the Chapter 11 filing may impact all entities, including non-filing entities, and include the following: 
the ability of OSG to continue as a going concern; &#160; 
the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval with respect to motions in the Chapter 11 Cases and the outcomes of Bankruptcy Court rulings of the case in general; &#160; 
the length of time OSG will operate under the Chapter 11 Cases and its ability to successfully emerge; &#160; 
the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to obtain confirmation of or consummate the Plan or another plan of reorganization with respect to the Chapter 11 cases; &#160; 
OSG&#8217;s ability to obtain Bankruptcy Court and creditor approval of the Plan and the impact of alternative proposals, views and objections of creditor committees and representatives, which may make it difficult to develop and consummate a reorganization plan in a timely manner; &#160; 
risks associated with third party motions in the Chapter 11 Cases, which may interfere with the Company&#8217;s operations and/or the Plan; &#160; 
the ability to maintain sufficient liquidity throughout the Chapter 11 proceedings including operating the Company&#8217;s cash management system; &#160; 
material increased costs related to the bankruptcy filing and other litigation; &#160; 
the Company&#8217;s ability to manage contracts that are critical to its operation and to obtain and maintain appropriate terms with customers, suppliers and service providers; &#160; 
OSG&#8217;s success in obtaining &#8220;exit financing&#8221; as may be required to fund the implementation cost of the Company&#8217;s Plan and emergence from bankruptcy, including obtaining $735 million of secured exit financing as provided in the Plan; &#160; 
the Company&#8217;s ability to preserve the benefits of the automatic stay imposed by the Bankruptcy Code and defend against any efforts to lift the automatic stay; &#160; 
the Company&#8217;s ability to fairly resolve legacy liabilities in alignment with the Company&#8217;s Plan; &#160; 
the outcome of all pre-petition claims against the Company; and &#160; 
the Company&#8217;s ability to maintain existing customers, vendors relationships, employees, joint venturers and pool participants and expand sales to new customers. 
Continued investment, capital needs, restructuring payments and servicing the Company&#8217;s debt require a significant amount of cash and the Company&#8217;s ability to generate cash may be affected by factors beyond the Company&#8217;s control. 
The Company&#8217;s business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable OSG to fund the Company&#8217;s liquidity needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, investments and alliances, professional fees in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases and other general corporate requirements. 
The Company&#8217;s ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, litigation, regulatory and other factors that are beyond the Company&#8217;s control. No assurance can be given that: 
the Company&#8217;s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations; &#160; 
OSG&#8217;s plans to generate cash proceeds through the sale of non-core assets will be successful; &#160; 
the Company will be able to repatriate or move cash to locations where and when it is needed; &#160; 
OSG will realize cost savings, earnings growth and operating improvements resulting from the execution of the Plan; or &#160; 
future sources of funding will be available to the Company in amounts sufficient to enable the Company to fund its liquidity needs. 
If the Company cannot fund its liquidity needs, the Company will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, and investments and alliances; selling additional assets; restructuring or refinancing the Company&#8217;s debt; or seeking additional equity capital. These actions may be restricted as a result of the Company&#8217;s Chapter 11 filing. Such actions could increase OSG&#8217;s debt, negatively impact customer confidence in the Company&#8217;s ability to provide services, reduce the Company&#8217;s ability to raise additional capital, and delay emergence from Chapter 11 protection and sustained profitability. No assurance can be given that any of these remedies could be implemented on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that they would permit the Company to meet its adequate protection obligations. 
The Company may seek to raise cash proceeds from the sale of non-core assets, however, such efforts may not be successful in raising sufficient cash, may be negatively impacted by factors beyond the Company&#8217;s control and may harm the perception of the Company among customers, suppliers and service providers. 
A number of factors could influence the Company&#8217;s ability to successfully raise cash through asset sales, including the approval of the Bankruptcy Court, the process utilized to sell these assets, the number of potential buyers for these assets, the purchase price such buyers are willing to offer for these assets and their capacity to fund the purchase, or the ability of potential buyers to conclude transactions and potential issues in the closing of transactions due to regulatory or governmental review process. One or more of these or other factors could negatively affect the timing of planned asset sales and the level of cash proceeds derived from the sales, which could adversely impact the Company&#8217;s cash generation and liquidity. As a result, the Company may be unable to receive adequate consideration for any vessel or other asset disposition in the International Flag business, which dispositions may result in significant losses. Further, there is no assurance that these plans will be successful in raising sufficient cash proceeds or that the sale of certain of the Company&#8217;s assets will not harm the Company&#8217;s customers&#8217;, suppliers&#8217; and service providers&#8217; perception of the Company. 
If the Company is unsuccessful with its strategic investment decisions, the Company&#8217;s financial performance could be adversely affected. 
Historically, the Company has focused its investments on International Flag Crude Tankers, International Flag Product Carriers and U.S. Flag vessels. While the Company believes that each of these businesses has significant growth potential, they require potentially significant additional investments. Investment in these businesses may not be successful. If the Company is unsuccessful in managing and growing the Company&#8217;s businesses as planned, the Company&#8217;s financial performance and cash flows could be adversely affected. 
The Company&#8217;s failure to implement plans to reduce the Company&#8217;s cost structure could negatively affect the Company&#8217;s consolidated results of operations, financial position and liquidity. 
The Company recognizes the need to continually rationalize the Company&#8217;s workforce and streamline the Company&#8217;s operations to remain competitive in the face of a difficult business and economic climate. In 2012, the Company consolidated technical management of its International Flag conventional tanker fleet and in 2013, the Company reduced its corporate services workforce. In 2014, OSG announced plans to outsource technical and commercial management of its International Flag conventional tanker fleet. No assurance can be given that such outsourcing will be implemented successfully. If the Company fails to implement successfully cost rationalization plans, the Company&#8217;s operational results, financial position and liquidity could be negatively impacted. Additionally, if reorganization plans are not effectively managed the Company may experience a loss of customers, reduced business opportunities and other unanticipated effects, causing harm to the Company&#8217;s business and customer relationships. The business plan that may be adopted in connection with the Company&#8217;s Chapter 11 reorganization will be subject to a number of assumptions, projections, and analyses. If any of these assumptions prove to be incorrect, the Company may be unsuccessful in executing the Company&#8217;s plan, which could adversely impact its financial results and liquidity. Additionally, the Company&#8217;s ability to execute restructuring with the entities filing for Chapter 11 is subject to the approval by the Bankruptcy Court. Finally, the timing and implementation of these plans require compliance with numerous laws and regulations, and the failure to comply with such requirements may result in damages, fines and penalties which could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s cost structure and cash flows. 
Any plan of reorganization that the Company may implement will be based in large part upon assumptions and analyses developed by the Company. If these assumptions and analyses prove to be incorrect, the Company&#8217;s plan may be unsuccessful in its execution. 
The Plan, if implemented, would affect both OSG&#8217;s capital structure and the ownership, structure and operation of its businesses and reflects assumptions and analyses based on the Company&#8217;s experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors that are considered appropriate under the circumstances. Whether actual future results and developments will be consistent with the Company&#8217;s expectations and assumptions depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to (i) OSG&#8217;s ability to change substantially its capital structure; (ii) the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain adequate liquidity and financing sources; (iii) the Company&#8217;s ability to maintain customers&#8217; confidence in OSG&#8217;s viability as a continuing entity and to attract and retain sufficient business from such customers; (iv) the Company&#8217;s ability to retain key employees; and (v) the overall strength and stability of general economic conditions of the financial and shipping industries, both in the U.S. and in global markets. The failure of any of these factors could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s successful reorganization. 
In addition, the Plan relies upon financial projections, including with respect to revenues, EBITDA, debt service and cash flow. Financial forecasts are inherently speculative, and it is likely that one or more of the assumptions and estimates that are the basis of these financial forecasts will not be accurate. In the Company&#8217;s case, the forecasts are even more speculative than normal because they involve fundamental changes in the Company&#8217;s capital structure. Accordingly, the Company expects that its actual financial condition and results of operations will differ, possibly materially, from what such forecasts anticipate. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the results or developments contemplated by any plan of reorganization the Company may implement will occur or, even if they do occur, that they will have the anticipated effects on the Company and its subsidiaries or businesses or operations. The failure of any such results or developments to materialize as anticipated could materially adversely affect the successful execution of any plan of reorganization. 
If the Company cannot attract, retain and motivate key employees, the Company&#8217;s revenue and earnings could be harmed. 
In order for the Company to be successful, the Company must continue to attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, including maritime professionals is critical to the Company&#8217;s future. If the Company cannot attract qualified individuals, retain key executives and employees or motivate the Company&#8217;s employees, the Company&#8217;s business could be harmed. The Company&#8217;s filing for Chapter 11 creates uncertainty for employees and may impact OSG&#8217;s ability to retain key employees and effectively recruit new employees. The Company&#8217;s ability to take measures to motivate and retain key employees is also subject to restrictions while operating under Chapter 11. The outsourcing of the technical and commercial management of the International Flag conventional tankers will result in the termination of employment of those employees who performed those duties. Pending completion of such outsourcing, the Company needs to retain and motivate those employees to perform their responsibilities. While the Company had adopted certain compensation programs to retain and motivate such employees, including a cash incentive compensation program and a transitional incentive program for non-executive employees, no assurance can be given that such programs will be successful in keeping such employees until completion of outsourcing. 
The Company may be required to recognize additional impairments in the value of the Company&#8217;s goodwill and/or other long-lived assets, which would increase expenses and reduce profitability . 
Goodwill represents the excess of the amount the Company paid to acquire businesses over the fair value of their net assets at the date of the acquisition. The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Additionally, the Company&#8217;s other long-lived assets, such as intangible assets and vessels, are evaluated for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Either of these situations may occur for various reasons including changes in actual or expected income or cash. The Company&#8217;s newly focused strategy resulted in a triggering event warranting an interim test for the impairment of both goodwill and intangible assets. Impairment charges of $9,589 and $6,625 were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013, relating to the International Crude Lightering business goodwill and intangible assets, respectively. Additionally, impairment charges of $365,976 and $279,382 were recorded in the fourth quarters of 2013 and 2012, respectively, relating to International Flag vessels. Impairments could occur in the future if market or interest rate environments deteriorate, expected future cash flows of the Company&#8217;s vessels decline, or if reporting unit carrying values change materially compared with changes in respective fair values. 
Even if a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization is consummated, continued weakness or worsening of economic conditions could continue to adversely affect the Company&#8217;s financial performance and the Company&#8217;s liquidity. 
The global economic recession affecting the international tanker industry adversely affected the Company&#8217;s operating results and financial condition and was a primary factor leading to the Company filing for voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Further, global financial markets have been experiencing contraction and volatility, especially with respect to key lenders to shipping companies. Economic conditions could also accelerate the continuing decline in demand for vessels, placing pressure on the Company&#8217;s results of operations and liquidity. If the global economic weakness and tightness in the credit markets continue for a greater period of time than anticipated or worsen, the Company&#8217;s profitability and related cash generation capability could be adversely affected and, therefore, affect the Company&#8217;s ability to meet the Company&#8217;s anticipated cash needs, impair the Company&#8217;s liquidity or increase the Company&#8217;s costs of borrowing. 
As the Company streamlines its operations and reduces its general and administrative expenses, it needs to upgrade its management infrastructure and systems to maintain the quality of its operations and satisfaction of its customers. 
In connection with its Chapter 11 Cases, the Company has embarked on several initiatives to streamline its operations and reduce its general and administrative expenses, including reducing levels of management, increasing responsibilities of key personnel and centralizing its financial data operations. As a result of the Company&#8217;s decision to outsource certain management services relating to its International Flag conventional tankers, additional reductions in corporate services management and non-executive employees will occur during 2014. These initiatives have the inherent risk that implementation adversely impacts the Company&#8217;s control of the quality of its operations. Although it is impossible to predict what errors might occur as the result of inadequate controls or reduced staff, it is harder to manage a sizable operation, especially one undergoing transition, with fewer personnel and, accordingly, it is more likely that errors will occur unless management infrastructure and systems are upgraded in line with the evolving facts and circumstances and monitored. 
The commencement and prosecution of the Chapter 11 Cases has consumed and will continue to consume a substantial portion of the time and attention of the Company&#8217;s management and will impact how its business is conducted, which may have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business and results of operations. 
The requirements of the Chapter 11 Cases have consumed and will continue to consume a substantial portion of the Company&#8217;s management&#8217;s time and attention and leave them with less time to devote to the operation of the Company&#8217;s business. This diversion of attention may materially adversely affect the conduct of OSG&#8217;s business, and, as a result, have an adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations. 
As a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, OSG&#8217;s historical financial information may not be indicative of OSG&#8217;s future financial performance. 
The Company&#8217;s capital structure will likely be significantly altered under any plan of reorganization ultimately confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court. Under fresh-start reporting rules that may apply to the Company upon the effective date of any reorganization plan the Company may adopt, the Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities would be adjusted to fair values and the Company&#8217;s retained earnings would be restated to zero. Accordingly, if fresh-start reporting rules apply, the Company&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations following its emergence from Chapter 11 would not be comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in the Company&#8217;s historical financial statements. In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, it is also possible that additional restructuring and related charges may be identified and recorded in future periods. Such charges could be material to OSG&#8217;s consolidated financial position and results of operations in any given period. Finally, the structure of any reorganization may cause the Company&#8217;s financial conditions and results of operations following its emergence from Chapter 11 not to be comparable to the Company&#8217;s historical financial information. 
The Company&#8217;s common stock is no longer listed on a national securities exchange and is quoted only in the over-the-counter market, which could negatively affect the stock price and liquidity. 
Until the Company&#8217;s voluntary Chapter 11 filing on November 14, 2012, the shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock were listed on the NYSE under the symbol &#8220;OSG.&#8221; Upon the announcement of the Chapter 11 filing, the NYSE suspended the trading of the Company&#8217;s shares and the common stock commenced trading on the OTC market under the trading symbol &#8220;OSGIQ.&#8221; However, the extent of the public market for the common stock and the continued availability of quotations depend upon such factors as the aggregate market value of the common stock, the interest in maintaining a market in OSG&#8217;s common stock on the part of securities firms and other factors. The over-the-counter market is a significantly more limited market than the NYSE, and the quotation of OSG&#8217;s common stock in the over-the-counter market may result in a less liquid market available for existing and potential stockholders to trade shares of OSG&#8217;s common stock. This could further depress the trading price of the common stock and could also have a long-term adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s ability to raise capital. There can be no assurance that any public market for the common stock will exist in the future. 
Trading in the Company&#8217;s securities during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. While the Plan specifies the distributions that will be made to holders of the Company&#8217;s equity and debt securities it is impossible to predict at this time whether or when the holders of such securities will receive under any final plan of reorganization confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court any distribution with respect to, or be able to recover any portion of, their investments. 
Under the priority scheme established by the Bankruptcy Code, unless creditors agree otherwise, post-petition liabilities and pre-petition liabilities must be satisfied in full before stockholders are entitled to receive any distribution or retain any property under a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization. The ultimate recovery to creditors and/or stockholders, if any, will not be determined until confirmation of such a plan. While the Plan provides that holders of shares of common stock and allowed claims subordinated pursuant to section 510(b) of the Bankruptcy Code would receive Reorganized OSG Stock and Reorganized OSG Jones Act Warrants valued at $61.4 million, subject to dilution on account of a management and director incentive program and a $300 million rights offering, no assurance can be given as to what types or amounts of distributions, if any, holders of common stock would receive or what values, if any, will be ascribed to such distributions, in a final plan of reorganization confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court. If certain requirements of the Bankruptcy Code are met, the Plan can be confirmed notwithstanding its rejection by the class comprising the interests of Company equity security holders. 
In the event of cancellation of the Company&#8217;s equity or debt securities, amounts invested by the holders of such securities will not be recoverable and such securities would have no value. Trading prices for the Company&#8217;s equity or debt securities may bear little or no relationship to the actual recovery, if any, by the holders thereof in the Chapter 11 Cases. Accordingly, the Company urges extreme caution with respect to existing and future investments in OSG&#8217;s equity or other securities. 
In addition, the Bankruptcy Court has entered two orders that place certain limitations on trading in certain of OSG&#8217;s securities to protect the Company&#8217;s net operating loss (&#8220;NOL&#8221;) carryforwards, a tax asset of the Company, both prior to and potentially in connection with a bankruptcy plan of reorganization. For this reason, under one such order, investors need the Company&#8217;s consent or court approval before effecting any transactions in common stock of the Company if they hold, or would as a result of the transaction hold, at least 4.7% of the outstanding shares of such common stock. Under the other order, any person or entity that beneficially own claims against the Company totaling more than either (i) $25 million in aggregate of the 8.75% Debentures due 2013, the 8.125% Senior Notes due 2018, or the 7.5% Senior Notes due 2024, (ii) $67.5 million under the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, or (iii) $90 million of any unsecured claims against the Company including those in the previous two categories, where each dollar amount is subject to revision by further notice from the Company (each, a &#8220;Substantial Claimholder&#8221;), may be required, pursuant to a subsequent motion of the Company and Bankruptcy Court order, either to seek the Company&#8217;s consent before effecting any further acquisition of claims against the Company, or to &#8220;sell down&#8221; a portion of its claims against the Company prior to a bankruptcy reorganization. 
Transfers or issuances of our equity, or a debt restructuring, may impair or reduce our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes in the future. 
Pursuant to U.S. tax rules, a corporation is generally permitted to deduct from taxable income in any year NOLs carried forward from prior years. Our ability to utilize these NOL carryforwards could be subject to a significant limitation if we were to undergo an &#8220;ownership change&#8221; for purposes of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, during or as a result of our Chapter 11 Cases. The Bankruptcy Court has entered orders that place certain restrictions on trading in OSG common shares, and other procedures relating to trading in claims against OSG, during the Chapter 11 Cases. However, OSG can provide no assurances that these limitations will prevent an &#8220;ownership change&#8221; or that OSG&#8217;s ability to utilize its NOL carryforwards may not be significantly limited as a result of its reorganization. 
A restructuring of OSG&#8217;s debt pursuant to the Chapter 11 Cases may give rise to cancellation of debt, i.e. debt forgiveness (&#8220;COD&#8221;), which if it occurs would generally be non-taxable. If the COD is non-taxable, and we have remaining NOL carryforwards at the end of the tax year in which such COD arises, we will be required to reduce our NOL carryforwards and other attributes such as capital loss carryforwards and tax basis in assets, by an amount equal to the non-recognized COD. Therefore, it is possible that, as a result of the successful completion of plans for the conclusion of the Chapter 11 Cases, we will have a reduction of NOL carryforwards and/or other tax attributes in an amount that cannot be determined at this time and that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. While the Plan does not contemplate COD, no assurance can be given that the Bankruptcy Court will confirm the Plan or that conditions precedent to effectiveness of the Plan will occur. 
Any changes to the Company&#8217;s capital structure may have a material adverse effect on existing debt and security holders. 
Any reorganization of the Company&#8217;s capital structure may include exchanges of new debt or equity securities for existing securities, and such new debt or equity securities may be issued at different interest rates, payment schedules, and maturities than our existing securities. The Company may also modify or amend its existing securities to the same effect. Such exchanges or modifications are inherently complex to implement. The success of a reorganization, through any such exchanges or modifications will depend on approval by the Bankruptcy Court and the willingness of existing security holders to agree to the exchange or modification, and there can be no guarantee of success. If such exchanges or modifications are successful, holders of debt may find their holdings no longer have any value or are materially reduced in value, or they may be converted to equity and be diluted or receive debt with a principal amount that is less than the outstanding principal amount, longer maturities, and reduced interest rates. There can be no assurance that any new debt or equity securities will maintain their value at the time of issuance. Also, if the existing debt or equity security holders are adversely affected by a reorganization, it may adversely affect the Company&#8217;s ability to issue new debt or equity in the future. 
The Plan provides for the payment in full, in cash, including post-petition interest, of creditors&#8217; allowed non-subordinated claims against the Company, except for claims under the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (for which holders will receive their pro rata share of Reorganized OSG Stock and Reorganized OSG Jones Act Warrants) and under the 2018 and 2024 Unsecured Senior Notes (which will be reinstated following payment of outstanding interest). Under the Plan Support Agreement, the Consenting Lenders have agreed to support and vote in favor of the Plan. No assurance can be given that the Bankruptcy Court will confirm the Plan or that conditions precedent to effectiveness of the Plan will occur. 
The Company may not be able to obtain confirmation of a reorganization. 
In order for the Company to emerge successfully from the Chapter 11 Cases as a viable entity, the Company, like any other Chapter 11 debtor, must obtain approval of a reorganization plan from its creditors and confirmation of a plan of reorganization through the Bankruptcy Court, and then successfully implement the plan of reorganization. The foregoing process requires the Company to (i) meet certain statutory requirements with respect to the adequacy of the disclosure statement relating to the plan of reorganization, (ii) solicit and obtain acceptances from creditors whose rights are impaired by the plan of reorganization and (iii) fulfill other statutory conditions with respect to the confirmation of the plan of reorganization. There can be no assurance that the Plan will be approved by the Company&#8217;s creditors and confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court. Upon the occurrence of certain conditions, including the failure of the Bankruptcy Court to enter an order (i) approving the disclosure statement for the Plan by May 16, 2014 and (ii) confirming the Plan by June 20, 2014, the Plan Support Agreement could be terminated. If the Plan Support Agreement is terminated the Consenting Lenders would not be obligated to vote in favor of or otherwise support the Plan. Such a termination could materially impair the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain confirmation of the Plan. 
There can be no assurance as to the timing of the acceptance or confirmation of the Plan or that any conditions to the Plan&#8217;s effectiveness will ever occur. The impact that prolonging completion of the Chapter 11 Cases may have on the Company&#8217;s operations cannot be accurately predicted or quantified. The continuation of the Chapter 11 Cases, particularly if the Plan is not approved, confirmed, or implemented within the time frame proposed by management, or in the event that competing creditor plans are filed or proposed, could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s operations and relationships between the Company and its customers and charterers, suppliers, service providers and creditors as well as the viability of the Company&#8217;s joint venture interests; result in increased professional fees and similar expenses; and threaten the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain financing. Failure to confirm the Plan or any delay of its effectiveness could further weaken the Company&#8217;s liquidity position, which could jeopardize the Company&#8217;s exit from Chapter 11, force the sale of the Company or certain of its material assets or result in the appointment of a trustee and/or conversion of the Company&#8217;s Chapter 11 Cases to a liquidation under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. 
Industry specific risk factors: 
The highly cyclical nature of the industry may lead to volatile changes in charter rates and vessel values, which may adversely affect the Company&#8217;s earnings. 
Factors affecting the supply and demand for vessels are outside of the Company&#8217;s control, and the nature, timing and degree of changes in industry conditions are unpredictable and may adversely affect the values of the Company&#8217;s vessels and result in significant fluctuations in the amount of charter hire the Company may earn, which could result in significant fluctuations in OSG&#8217;s quarterly results and cash flows. The factors that influence the demand for tanker capacity include: 
demand for and availability of oil and oil products, which affect the need for vessel capacity; 
global and regional economic and political conditions which among other things, could impact the supply of oil as well as trading patterns and the demand for various types of vessels; 
changes in the production of crude oil, including production by OPEC, the United States and other key producers, which impact the need for vessel capacity; 
developments in international trade; 
changes in seaborne and other transportation patterns, including changes in the distances that cargoes are transported; 
environmental concerns and regulations; 
new pipeline construction and expansions; 
weather; and 
competition from alternative sources of energy. 
The factors that influence the supply of vessel capacity include: 
the number of newbuilding deliveries; 
the scrapping rate of older vessels; 
the number of vessels that are used for storage or as floating storage offloading service vessels; 
the conversion of vessels from transporting oil and oil products to carrying dry bulk cargo and the reverse conversion; 
the number of vessels that are out of service; and 
environmental and maritime regulations. 
The market value of vessels fluctuates significantly, which could adversely affect OSG&#8217;s liquidity or otherwise adversely affect its financial condition. 
The market value of vessels has fluctuated over time. The fluctuation in market value of vessels over time is based upon various factors, including: 
age of the vessel; 
general economic and market conditions affecting the tanker industry, including the availability of vessel financing; 
number of vessels in the world fleet; 
types and sizes of vessels available; 
changes in trading patterns affecting demand for particular sizes and types of vessels; 
cost of newbuildings; 
prevailing level of charter rates; 
competition from other shipping companies; 
other modes of transportation; and 
technological advances in vessel design and propulsion. 
Vessel values have declined during the past few years. As vessels grow older, they generally decline in value. These factors will affect the value of the Company&#8217;s vessels at the time of any vessel sale. If OSG sells a vessel at a sale price that is less than the vessel&#8217;s carrying amount on its financial statements, the Company will incur a loss on the sale and a reduction in earnings and surplus. In addition, declining values of the Company&#8217;s vessels could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s liquidity by limiting its ability to raise cash by refinancing vessels. 
An increase in the supply of vessels without a commensurate increase in demand for such vessels could cause charter rates to remain at depressed levels or to further decline, which could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s revenues, profitability and cash flows and on the value of its vessels. 
OSG depends on short term duration or &#8220;spot&#8221; charters, for a significant portion of its revenues, further exposing OSG to fluctuations in market conditions. In 2013, 2012 and 2011, OSG derived approximately 52%, 64% and 65%, respectively, of its TCE revenues in the spot market. 
The marine transportation industry has been highly cyclical, as the profitability and asset values of companies in the industry have fluctuated based on changes in the supply and demand of vessels. If the number of new ships delivered exceeds the number of vessels being scrapped, capacity will increase. Historically, we have generally seen the supply of vessels increase with deliveries of new vessels and decrease with the scrapping of older vessels. The newbuilding order book equaled 12% of the existing world tanker fleet as of December 31, 2013, the same percentage as of December 31, 2012 and down from 18% as of December 31, 2011. 
In addition, vessel supply is affected by the number of vessels that are used for floating storage because vessels that are used for storage are not available to transport crude oil and petroleum products. Utilization of vessels for storage is affected by expectations of changes in the price of oil and petroleum products, with utilization generally increasing if prices are expected to increase more than storage costs and generally decreasing if they are not. A reduction in vessel utilization for storage will generally increase vessel supply. For example, in 2010, 81 vessels were released from storage and reentered the trading fleet. Since the 2010 release, storage on vessels at sea has been low, in part because then current prices of crude oil have generally exceeded the future prices, a condition which allows companies to replace inventories at lower prices, encouraging the drawdown of commercial inventories. Supply has exceeded demand during the past four years, resulting in lower charter rates across the International Flag fleet. If this trend continues, the charter rates for the Company&#8217;s International Flag vessels could continue at current depressed levels that are well below historical averages, which would have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s revenues, profitability and cash flows if sustained over a long period of time. 
Shipping is a business with inherent risks, and OSG&#8217;s insurance may not be adequate to cover its losses. 
OSG&#8217;s vessels and their cargoes are at risk of being damaged or lost because of events including, but not limited to: 
marine disasters; 
bad weather; 
mechanical failures; 
human error; 
war, terrorism and piracy; and 
other unforeseen circumstances or events. 
In addition, transporting crude oil creates a risk of business interruptions due to political circumstances in foreign countries, hostilities, labor strikes, port closings and boycotts. Any of these events may result in loss of revenues, decreased cash flows and increased costs. 
While the Company carries insurance to protect against certain risks involved in the conduct of its business, risks may arise against which the Company is not adequately insured. For example, a catastrophic spill could exceed OSG&#8217;s $1 billion per vessel insurance coverage and have a material adverse effect on its operations. In addition, OSG may not be able to procure adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates in the future, and OSG cannot guarantee that any particular claim will be paid by its insurers. In the past, new and stricter environmental regulations have led to higher costs for insurance covering environmental damage or pollution, and new regulations could lead to similar increases or even make this type of insurance unavailable. Furthermore, even if insurance coverage is adequate to cover the Company&#8217;s losses, OSG may not be able to timely obtain a replacement ship in the event of a loss. OSG may also be subject to calls, or premiums, in amounts based not only on its own claim records but also the claim records of all other members of the protection and indemnity associations through which OSG obtains insurance coverage for tort liability. OSG&#8217;s payment of these calls could result in significant expenses which would reduce its profits and cash flows or cause losses. 
Constraints on capital availability adversely affect the tanker industry and OSG&#8217;s business. 
Constraints on capital that have occurred during recent years have adversely affected the financial condition of certain of the Company&#8217;s customers, joint venture partners, financial lenders and suppliers, including shipyards from whom the Company has contracted to purchase vessels. Entities that suffer a material adverse impact on their financial condition may be unable or unwilling to comply with their contractual commitments to OSG including the refusal or inability of customers to pay charter hire to OSG, failure of shipyards to construct and deliver to OSG newbuilds or the inability or unwillingness of joint venture partners or financial lenders to honor their commitments to contribute funds to a joint venture or lend funds. While OSG seeks to monitor the financial condition of such entities, the availability and accuracy of information about the financial condition of such entities and the actions that OSG may take to reduce possible losses resulting from the failure of such entities to comply with their contractual obligations may be limited. Such failure of customers, joint venture partners, financial lenders and suppliers to meet their contractual obligations may have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s revenues, profitability and cash flows. In addition, adverse financial conditions may inhibit customers, joint venture partners, financial lenders and suppliers from entering into new commitments with OSG, which could have a material adverse effect on revenues, profitability and cash flows. 
See also &#8220;&#151;Company specific risk factors&#151;The Company is subject to credit risks with respect to its counterparties on contracts and failure of such counterparties to meet their obligations could cause the Company to suffer losses on such contracts, decreasing revenues and earnings&#8221; and &#8220;&#151;Company specific risk factors&#151;OSG has incurred significant indebtedness which could affect its ability to finance its operations, pursue desirable business opportunities and successfully run its business in the future, and therefore make it more difficult for OSG to fulfill its obligations under its indebtedness.&#8221; 
Acts of piracy on ocean-going vessels could adversely affect our business. 
The frequency of pirate attacks on seagoing vessels remains high, particularly in the western part of the Indian Ocean and off the west coast of Africa. If piracy attacks result in regions in which the company&#8217;s vessels are deployed being characterized by insurers as &#8220;war risk&#8221; zones, as the Gulf of Aden has been, or Joint War Committee &#8220;war and strikes&#8221; listed areas, premiums payable for such insurance coverage could increase significantly and such insurance coverage may be more difficult to obtain. Crew costs and costs of employing onboard security guards could also increase in such circumstances. 
In addition, while OSG believes the charterer remains liable for charter payments when a vessel is seized by pirates, the charterer may dispute this and withhold charter hire until the vessel is released. A charterer may also claim that a vessel seized by pirates was not &#8220;on-hire&#8221; for a certain number of days and it is therefore entitled to cancel the charter party, a claim that the Company would dispute. We may not be adequately insured to cover losses from these incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, hijacking as a result of an act of piracy against the Company&#8217;s vessels, or an increase in cost, or unavailability of insurance for its vessels, could have a material adverse impact on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Terrorist attacks and international hostilities and instability can affect the tanker industry, which could adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business. 
Terrorist attacks, the outbreak of war, or the existence of international hostilities could damage the world economy, adversely affect the availability of and demand for crude oil and petroleum products and adversely affect the Company&#8217;s ability to charter its vessels and the charter rates payable under any charters. Additionally, OSG operates in a sector of the economy that is likely to be adversely impacted by the effects of political instability, terrorist or other attacks, war or international hostilities. These factors could also increase the costs to OSG of conducting its business, particularly crew, insurance and security costs, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s profitability and cash flows. 
OSG conducts its operations internationally, subjecting the Company to changing economic, political and governmental conditions abroad which may adversely affect our business. 
The Company conducts its operations internationally, and its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected by changing economic, political and government conditions in the countries and regions where its vessels are employed, including 
pandemics or epidemics which may result in a disruption of worldwide trade including quarantines of certain areas; 
currency fluctuations; 
the imposition of taxes by flag states, port states and jurisdictions in which OSG or its subsidiaries are incorporated or where its vessels operate; 
adverse changes in other international laws impacting OSG&#8217;s business; and 
expropriation of its vessels. 
The occurrence of such events could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, OSG&#8217;s international operations subject it to certain risks regarding taxation of foreign subsidiary income, see &#8220;&#151;Company specific risk factors&#151; OSG&#8217;s financial condition would be materially adversely affected if the shipping income of OSG&#8217;s foreign subsidiaries becomes subject to current taxation in the U.S.&#8221; 
Our vessels may be directed to call on ports located in countries that are subject to restrictions imposed by the U.S. government, which could negatively affect the trading price of our common shares. 
From time to time, certain of our vessels, on the instructions of the charterers or pool manager responsible for the commercial management of such vessels, have called and may again call on ports located in countries subject to sanctions and embargoes imposed by the U.S. government, the United Nations (&#8220;UN&#8221;) or the EU and countries identified by the U.S. government, the UN or the EU as state sponsors of terrorism. The U.S., UN and EU sanctions and embargo laws and regulations vary in their application, as they do not all apply to the same covered persons or proscribe the same activities, and such sanctions and embargo laws and regulations may be amended or strengthened over time. Some sanctions may also apply to transportation of goods (including crude oil) originating in sanctioned countries (particularly Iran), even if the vessel does not travel to those countries, or otherwise acting on behalf of sanctioned persons. Sanctions may include the imposition of penalties and fines against companies violating national law or threaten that companies acting outside the jurisdiction of the sanctioning power may themselves become the target of sanctions. 
Although OSG believes that it is in compliance with all applicable sanctions and embargo laws and regulations and intends to maintain such compliance and that OSG does not, and does not intend to, engage in sanctionable activity, there can be no assurance that OSG will be in compliance in the future, particularly as the scope of certain laws may be unclear and may be subject to changing interpretations. Any such violation or sanctionable activity could result in fines or other penalties, or the imposition of sanctions against the Company, and could result in some investors deciding, or being required, to divest their interest, or not to invest, in the Company and negatively affect OSG&#8217;s reputation and investor perception of the value of OSG&#8217;s common stock. 
Compliance with environmental laws or regulations, including those relating to the emission of greenhouse gases, may adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business. 
The Company&#8217;s operations are affected by extensive and changing international, national and local environmental protection laws, regulations, treaties, conventions and standards in force in international waters, the jurisdictional waters of the countries in which OSG&#8217;s vessels operate, as well as the countries of its vessels&#8217; registration. Many of these requirements are designed to reduce the risk of oil spills. They also regulate other water pollution issues, including discharge of ballast water and effluents and air emissions, including emission of greenhouse gases. These requirements impose significant capital and operating costs on OSG. 
Environmental laws and regulations also can affect the resale value or significantly reduce the useful lives of the Company&#8217;s vessels, require a reduction in carrying capacity, ship modifications or operational changes or restrictions, lead to decreased availability or higher cost of insurance coverage for environmental matters or result in the denial of access to, or detention in, certain jurisdictional waters or ports. Under local, national and foreign laws, as well as international treaties and conventions, OSG could incur material liabilities, including cleanup obligations, in the event that there is a release of petroleum or other hazardous substances from its vessels or otherwise in connection with its operations. OSG could also become subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to the release of or exposure to hazardous materials associated with its current or historic operations. Violations of or liabilities under environmental requirements also can result in substantial penalties, fines and other sanctions, including in certain instances, seizure or detention of the Company&#8217;s vessels. 
OSG could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs, fines, penalties, third-party claims and natural resource damages, as the result of an oil spill or liabilities under environmental laws. The Company is subject to the oversight of several government agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Maritime Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation. OPA 90 affects all vessel owners shipping oil or hazardous material to, from or within the United States. OPA 90 allows for potentially unlimited liability without regard to fault for owners, operators and bareboat charterers of vessels for oil pollution in U.S. waters. Similarly, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, as amended, which has been adopted by most countries outside of the United States, imposes liability for oil pollution in international waters. OPA 90 expressly permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to hazardous materials and oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries. Coastal states in the United States have enacted pollution prevention liability and response laws, many providing for unlimited liability. Similarly, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, as amended, which has been adopted by most countries outside of the United States, imposes liability for oil pollution in international waters. 
In addition, in complying with OPA 90, IMO regulations, EU directives and other existing laws and regulations and those that may be adopted, shipowners likely will incur substantial additional capital and/or operating expenditures in meeting new regulatory requirements, in developing contingency arrangements for potential spills and in obtaining insurance coverage. Key regulatory initiatives that are anticipated to require substantial additional capital and/or operating expenditures in the next several years include more stringent limits on the sulfur content of fuel oil for vessels operating in certain areas and more stringent requirements for management and treatment of ballast water. See the discussion of &#8220;Environmental and Security Matters Relating to Bulk Shipping&#8221; above. Other government regulation of vessels, particularly in the areas of safety and environmental requirements, can be expected to become more strict in the future and require the Company to incur significant capital expenditures on its vessels to keep them in compliance, or even to scrap or sell certain vessels altogether. Such expenditures could result in financial and operational impacts that may be material to OSG&#8217;s financial statements. 
Accidents involving highly publicized oil spills and other mishaps involving vessels can be expected in the tanker industry, and such accidents or other events could be expected to result in the adoption of even stricter laws and regulations, which could limit the Company&#8217;s operations or its ability to do business and which could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial results and cash flows. 
Due to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries, including the U.S., and international organizations, including the EU, the IMO and the UN, have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These regulatory measures include, among others, adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. Such actions could result in significant financial and operational impacts on the Company&#8217;s business, including requiring OSG to install new emission controls, acquire allowances or pay taxes related to its greenhouse gas emissions, or administer and manage a greenhouse gas emission program. See &#8220;Environmental and Security Matters Relating to Bulk Shipping.&#8221; In addition to the added costs, the concern over climate change and regulatory measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may reduce global demand for oil and oil products, which would have an adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial results and cash flows. 
OSG&#8217;s revenues are subject to seasonal variations. 
OSG operates its tankers in markets that have historically exhibited seasonal variations in demand for tanker capacity, and therefore, charter rates. Charter rates for tankers are typically higher in the fall and winter months as a result of increased oil consumption in the Northern Hemisphere. Because a majority of the Company&#8217;s vessels trade in the spot market, seasonality has affected OSG&#8217;s operating results on a quarter-to-quarter basis and could continue to do so in the future. Such seasonality may be outweighed in any period by then current economic conditions or tanker industry fundamentals. 
Company specific risk factors: 
OSG has incurred significant indebtedness which could affect its ability to finance its operations, pursue desirable business opportunities and successfully run its business in the future, and therefore make it more difficult for OSG to fulfill its obligations under its indebtedness . 
OSG has, and expects after emergence from Chapter 11 that it will continue to have, significant amounts of indebtedness. Although the Company is seeking to substantially reduce such debt in Chapter 11, it cannot predict if, or to what extent, these efforts will be successful. As of December 31, 2013, OSG had $2.6 billion of indebtedness that had been classified as liabilities subject to compromise. OSG&#8217;s substantial indebtedness and interest expense could have important consequences, including: 
OSG&#8217;s ability to continue to fund its obligations and to reduce debt may be affected by general economic, financial market, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, among other things. An inability to fund the Company&#8217;s debt requirements or reduce debt could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. 
The Company may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of its indebtedness. 
The Company&#8217;s earnings and cash flow vary significantly over time due to the cyclical nature of the tanker industry. As a result, the amount of debt that OSG can manage in some periods may not be appropriate in other periods. Additionally, future cash flow may be insufficient to meet the Company&#8217;s debt obligations and commitments. Any insufficiency could negatively impact OSG&#8217;s business. A range of economic, competitive, financial, business, industry and other factors will affect future financial performance, and, as a result, the Company&#8217;s ability to generate cash flow from operations and to pay debt. Many of these factors, such as charter rates, economic and financial conditions in the tanker industry and the global economy or competitive initiatives of competitors, are beyond the Company&#8217;s control. If OSG does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy its debt obligations, OSG may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as: 
No assurance can be given that undertaking alternative financing plans, if necessary, would be successful in allowing OSG to meet its debt obligations. The Company&#8217;s ability to restructure or refinance its debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets, its access thereto and OSG&#8217;s financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of debt could be at higher interest rates and may require the Company to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict OSG&#8217;s business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict OSG from adopting some of these alternatives. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit OSG to meet its scheduled debt service obligations. The Company&#8217;s inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its debt obligations, or to obtain alternative financing, could materially and adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. 
Litigation and regulatory inquiries associated with the restatement of the Company&#8217;s financial statements could result in substantial costs, penalties and other adverse effects. 
Substantial costs may be incurred to defend and resolve regulatory proceedings and litigation arising out of or relating to matters addressed in the Company inquiry completed in 2013. In completing the restatement, the Company examined the appropriateness of the Company&#8217;s accounting treatment of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the credit agreements for which OIN was a co-obligor with the Company on a joint and several basis. In conducting this analysis, the Company also determined that additional financial statement reserves were required with respect to certain other lesser tax compliance matters, including intercompany balances between OIN and the Company that gave rise to deemed dividend income to the Company. 
The Company is also subject to other regulatory and litigation proceedings relating to, or arising out of, the restatement, including a pending investigation by the SEC and purported securities class action lawsuits seeking relief against certain of the Company&#8217;s officers and its directors. These proceedings could also result in civil or criminal fines and other non-monetary penalties. The Company has not reserved any amount in respect of these matters in its consolidated financial statements. 
The Company cannot predict whether any monetary losses it experiences in the proceedings will be covered by insurance or whether insurance proceeds recovered will be sufficient to offset such losses. Pending civil, regulatory and criminal proceedings may also divert the efforts and attention of the Company&#8217;s management from business operations, particularly if adverse developments are experienced in any of them, such as an expansion of the investigations being conducted by the SEC. See Item 3, &#8220;Legal Proceedings,&#8221; for further discussion of these pending matters. 
The outsourcing of the technical and commercial management of the Company&#8217;s International Flag conventional tankers, which currently represents a significant portion of the Company&#8217;s worldwide operations, exposes the Company to the risks associated with reliance on third party service providers. 
During 2014, the Company will transition the outsourcing of the technical management of its International Flag conventional tankers to V. Ships., a third party service provider, and, in the case of the DSF vessels, to an affiliate of V. Ships, International Tanker Management, and will transfer commercial management of such vessels to other third party service providers, principally pools. 
In outsourcing, the Company loses direct control over technical and commercial management of its International Flag conventional tankers and must rely on the third party service providers to, among other things; 
No assurance can be given that the third party service providers selected by the Company will provide at least the comparable standard of service as the Company provided prior to any outsourcing. 
The Company&#8217;s business would be adversely affected if it failed to comply with the Jones Act provisions on coastwise trade, or if these provisions were repealed and if changes in international trade agreements were to occur. 
The Company is subject to the Jones Act and other federal laws that restrict maritime transportation between points in the United States (known as marine cabotage services or coastwise trade) to vessels built and registered in the United States and owned and manned by U.S. citizens. The Company is responsible for monitoring the foreign ownership of its common stock and other interests to ensure compliance with the Jones Act. If the Company does not comply with these restrictions, it would be prohibited from operating its vessels in U.S. coastwise trade, and under certain circumstances would be deemed to have undertaken an unapproved foreign transfer, resulting in severe penalties, including permanent loss of U.S. coastwise trading rights for the Company&#8217;s vessels, fines or forfeiture of the vessels. 
In order to ensure compliance with Jones Act citizenship requirements, and in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a requirement in July 1976 that at least 77% (the &#8220;Minimum Percentage&#8221;) of the Company&#8217;s common stock must be held by U.S. citizens. While the percentage of U.S. citizenship ownership of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common stock fluctuates daily, at times in the past several years it has declined to the Minimum Percentage. Any purported transfer of common stock in violation of these ownership provisions will be ineffective to transfer the shares of common stock or any voting, dividend or other rights associated with them. The existence and enforcement of this U.S. citizen ownership requirement could have an adverse impact on the liquidity or market value of our common stock in the event that U.S. citizens were unable to transfer shares of our common stock to non-U.S. citizens. Furthermore, under certain circumstances this ownership requirement could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company. 
Additionally, the Jones Act restrictions on the provision of maritime cabotage services are subject to exceptions under certain international trade agreements, including the General Agreement on Trade in Services (&#8220;GATS&#8221;) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (&#8220;NAFTA&#8221;). If maritime cabotage services were included in GATS, NAFTA or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise repealed or altered, the transportation of maritime cargo between U.S. ports could be opened to international flag or international-manufactured vessels. During the past several years, interest groups have lobbied Congress to repeal the Jones Act to facilitate international flag competition for trades and cargoes currently reserved for U.S. Flag vessels under the Jones Act and cargo preference laws. The Company believes that continued efforts will be made to modify or repeal the Jones Act and cargo preference laws currently benefiting U.S. Flag vessels. Because international vessels may have lower construction costs, wage rates and operating costs, this could significantly increase competition in the coastwise trade, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 
OSG may not be able to renew time charters when they expire or enter into new time charters for newbuilds. 
There can be no assurance that any of the Company&#8217;s existing time charters will be renewed at comparable rates or if renewed or entered into, that they will be at favorable rates. If, upon expiration of the existing time charters or delivery of newbuilds, OSG is unable to obtain time charters or voyage charters at desirable rates, the Company&#8217;s profitability and cash flows may be adversely affected. 
Delays or cost overruns in building new vessels, including delivery of any new vessels, the scheduled shipyard maintenance of the Company&#8217;s existing vessels, or conversion of the Company&#8217;s existing vessels could adversely affect OSG&#8217;s results of operations. 
Building new vessels, scheduled shipyard maintenance or conversion of vessels are subject to risks of delay (including the failure of suppliers to deliver new vessels) or cost overruns caused by circumstances including but not limited to, the following: 
Significant delays and cost overruns could increase the Company&#8217;s expected contract commitments, which would have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s revenues, borrowing capacity and results of operations. Furthermore, delays would result in vessels being out-of-service for extended periods of time, and therefore not earning revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations, including cash flows. The Company&#8217;s remedies for losses resulting from shipyards&#8217; failure to comply with their contractual commitments may be limited by such contracts, certain of which contain liquidated damages provisions that limit the amount of monetary damages that may be claimed or that limit the Company&#8217;s right to cancellation of the building contract. While purchase price payments for newbuild vessels made prior to vessel delivery to international shipyards are generally supported by guarantees from financial institutions, such as banks or insurance companies, such payments to U.S. shipyards historically have been supported by liens on the work in progress, including steel and equipment used for constructing the vessel, and not by guarantees from financial institutions. Due to these conventions, if a U.S. shipyard fails to deliver a contracted vessel, the Company&#8217;s investment may be supported only by the Company&#8217;s liens on the work in progress, which may result in a loss of part or all of the Company&#8217;s investment. Even with a financial institution guarantee, the Company may not be able to recover in a timely matter, or at all, its loss resulting from a shipyard&#8217;s failure to deliver. 
Termination or change in the nature of OSG&#8217;s relationship with any of the pools in which it participates could adversely affect its business. 
As of December 31, 2013, all but two of the Company&#8217;s Very Large Crude Carriers (&#8220;VLCCs&#8221;) participate in the TI pool. At December 31, 2013, eight of OSG&#8217;s Aframaxes participate in the AI pool and four of the Company&#8217;s crude Panamaxes and two of its Panamax Product Carriers participate directly in Panamax International. Participation in these pools is intended to enhance the financial performance of the Company&#8217;s vessels as a result of the higher vessel utilization. Any participant in any of these pools has the right to withdraw upon notice in accordance with the relevant pool agreement. The Company has decided to outsource the commercial management of its vessels and to dissolve the AI pool, a pool managed by the Company. &#160; The Company cannot predict whether other pools in which its vessels operate will continue to exist in the future. After the Chapter 11 filing, some participants in the pools have withdrawn or announced their intention to withdraw from pools in which OSG participates, or subjected OSG to trading restrictions within the pools. In addition, in recent years the EU has published guidelines on the application of the EU antitrust rules to traditional agreements for maritime services such as pools. While the Company believes that all the pools it participates in comply with EU rules, there has been limited administrative and judicial interpretation of the rules. Restrictive interpretations of the guidelines could adversely affect the ability to commercially market the respective types of vessels in pools. 
In the highly competitive international market, OSG may not be able to compete effectively for charters with companies with greater resources. 
The Company&#8217;s vessels are employed in a highly competitive market. Competition arises from other vessel owners, including major oil companies, which may have substantially greater resources than OSG does. Competition for the transportation of crude oil and other petroleum products depends on price, location, size, age, condition, and the acceptability of the vessel operator to the charterer. The Company believes that because ownership of the world tanker fleet is highly fragmented, no single vessel owner is able to influence charter rates. To the extent OSG enters into new geographic regions or provides new services, it may not be able to compete profitably. New markets may involve competitive factors that differ from those of the Company&#8217;s current markets, and the competitors in those markets may have greater financial strength and capital resources than OSG does. 
Changes in demand in specialized markets in which the Company currently trades may lead the Company to redeploy certain vessels to other markets. 
The Company deploys its vessels in several specialized markets, including, without limitation, Lightering in the Delaware Bay. The Company conducts those Lightering operations with two ATBs, which were constructed using funds withdrawn from the Company&#8217;s CCF. If lower demand in these markets adversely affects the Company&#8217;s financial position, the Company may consider redeploying these two ATBs in other markets. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete profitably in the new markets or that the ATBs can be fixed in new markets without substantial modification. 
Operating costs and capital expenses will increase as the Company&#8217;s vessels age. 
In general, capital expenditures and other costs necessary for maintaining a vessel in good operating condition increase as the age of the vessel increases. Accordingly, it is likely that the operating costs of OSG&#8217;s vessels will increase. In addition, changes in governmental regulations and compliance with Classification Society standards may require OSG to make additional expenditures for new equipment. In order to add such equipment, OSG may be required to take its vessels out of service. There can be no assurance that market conditions will justify such expenditures or enable OSG to operate its older vessels profitably during the remainder of their economic lives. 
Certain potential customers will not use vessels older than a specified age, even if they have been recently rebuilt. 
All of the Company&#8217;s existing articulated tug barges (&#8220;ATBs&#8221;) with the exception of the OSG Vision/OSG 350 and the OSG Horizon/OSG 351were originally constructed more than 25 years ago. While all of these tug-barge units were rebuilt and double-hulled since 1998 and are &#8220;in-class,&#8221; meaning the vessel has been certified by a classification society as being built and maintained in accordance with the rules of that classification society and complies with the applicable rules and regulations of the vessel&#8217;s country of registry and applicable international conventions, some potential customers have stated that they will not charter vessels that are more than 20 years old, even if they have been rebuilt. No assurance can be given that customers will continue to view rebuilt vessels as suitable. If more customers differentiate rebuilt vessels, time charter rates for our rebuilt ATBs will likely be adversely affected or they may not be employable. 
The Company is subject to credit risks with respect to its counterparties on contracts and failure of such counterparties to meet their obligations could cause the Company to suffer losses on such contracts, decreasing revenues and earnings. 
The Company charters its vessels to other parties, who pay the Company a daily rate of hire. The Company also enters COAs and Voyage Charters. Historically, the Company has not experienced material problems collecting charter hire but the global economic downturn of recent years has affected charterers more severely than the prior recessions that have occurred since the Company&#8217;s establishment more than 40 years ago. The Company also time charters or bareboat charters some of its vessels from other parties and its continued use and operation of such vessels depends on the vessel owners&#8217; compliance with the terms of the time charter or bareboat charter. Additionally, prior to the Chapter 11 filing and potentially after confirmation of a plan of reorganization, the Company has entered into derivative contracts (forward freight agreements [&#8220;FFAs&#8221;], bunker swaps, interest rate swaps and foreign currency contracts). All of these contracts subject the Company to counterparty credit risk. As a result, the Company is subject to credit risks at various levels, including with charterers or cargo interests. If the counterparties fail to meet their obligations, the Company could suffer losses on such contracts which would decrease revenues, cash flows and earnings. 
OSG&#8217;s financial condition would be materially adversely affected if the shipping income of OSG&#8217;s foreign subsidiaries becomes subject to current taxation in the U.S. 
As a result of changes made by the American Jobs Creations Act of 2004 (&#8220;2004 Act&#8221;), the Company does not include in its U.S. tax return on a current basis the unrepatriated shipping income earned by its international flag vessels, which in recent years represented substantially all of the Company&#8217;s pre-tax income. These changes in the 2004 Act were made to make U.S. controlled shipping companies competitive with foreign-controlled shipping companies, which are generally incorporated in jurisdictions in which they either do not pay income taxes or pay minimal income taxes. The taxation of OSG&#8217;s foreign subsidiaries under U.S. laws is a complex area and is subject to ongoing analysis and recalculation, which can have a material impact on the Company, see Note 14, &#8220;Taxes,&#8221; to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statement and Supplementary Data.&#8221; 
The President and several Congressmen and Senators have announced support for repealing certain tax provisions that purportedly incentivize companies to move jobs from the U.S. to foreign countries. While the Company believes that the changes made in the 2004 Act with respect to foreign shipping income do not &#8220;incentivize moving jobs offshore,&#8221; and, in fact, have enabled the Company to expand its U.S. Flag fleet and create jobs in the U.S., Congress may decide to repeal the changes made in the 2004 Act with respect to taxation of foreign shipping income for the aforementioned reason or as part of initiatives to reduce the U.S. budget deficit or to reform the U.S. corporate tax regime. Such repeal, either directly or indirectly by limiting or reducing benefits received under the 2004 Act, could have a materially adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial results and cash flows. 
The Company may face unexpected drydock costs for its vessels. 
Vessels must be drydocked periodically. The cost of repairs and renewals required at each drydock are difficult to predict with certainty and can be substantial. The Company&#8217;s insurance does not cover these costs. In addition, vessels may have to be drydocked in the event of accidents or other unforeseen damage. OSG&#8217;s insurance may not cover all of these costs. Large drydocking expenses could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s financial results and cash flows. 
Maritime claimants could arrest OSG&#8217;s vessels, which could interrupt its cash flow. 
Crew members, suppliers of goods and services to a vessel, shippers of cargo and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against that vessel for unsatisfied debts, claims or damages. In many jurisdictions, a maritime lien holder may enforce its lien by arresting a vessel through foreclosure proceedings. While the Company&#8217;s Chapter 11 filing has provided the Company with an automatic stay against the arrest of a vessel because of an obligation arising before the Chapter 11 filing, and against exercising control over the Company&#8217;s property on a post-petition basis, such stay may not be recognized in a specific jurisdiction, and the stay does not generally apply to obligations arising after the Chapter 11 filing. While the Company has obtained recognition of the Chapter 11 proceedings and the automatic stay in South Africa and in the Courts of England and Wales, the arrest or attachment of one or more of the Company&#8217;s vessels could interrupt OSG&#8217;s cash flow and require it to pay a significant amount of money to have the arrest lifted. In addition, in some jurisdictions, such as South Africa, under the &#8220;sister ship&#8221; theory of liability, a claimant may arrest both the vessel that is subject to the claimant&#8217;s maritime lien and any &#8220;associated&#8221; vessel, which is any vessel owned or controlled by the same owner. Claimants could try to assert &#8220;sister ship&#8221; liability against one vessel in the Company&#8217;s fleet for claims relating to another vessel in its fleet.

OSG,OVERSEAS SHIPHOLDING GROUP INC,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/75208/000114420413047751/0001144204-13-047751.txt,2013-08-26T07:37:13-04:00," ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
The following important risk factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements made in this report or presented elsewhere by management from time to time. If any of the circumstances or events described below actually arise or occur, the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
Chapter 11 Cases specific risk factors: 
On November 14, 2012, the Company and 180 of its direct and indirect subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the &#8220;Bankruptcy Code&#8221; or &#8220;Chapter 11&#8221;) in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the &#8220;Bankruptcy Court&#8221;), which are being jointly administered under docket number 12-20000 (the &#8220;Chapter 11 Cases&#8221;). The Company and its filing subsidiaries will continue to operate as &#8220;debtors in possession&#8221; in the ordinary course under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. See Note 3, &#8220;Bankruptcy Filing and Going Concern,&#8221; and Note 11, &#8220;Debt,&#8221; to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements set forth in Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; for a further discussion regarding the impact of the Chapter 11 filing on the Company&#8217;s debt agreements.
The Chapter 11 Cases are intended to permit the Company to reorganize and improve liquidity in the U.S. and abroad, monetize non-strategic assets, fairly resolve legacy liabilities, and focus on the most valuable business units to enable sustainable profitability. The Company&#8217;s goal is to develop and implement a reorganization plan that meets the standards for confirmation under the Bankruptcy Code. Confirmation of a reorganization plan could materially alter the classifications and amounts reported in the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements, which do not give effect to any adjustments to the carrying values of assets or amounts of liabilities that might be necessary as a consequence of confirmation of a reorganization plan or other arrangement or the effect of any operational changes that may be implemented.
The Company&#8217;s filing of the Chapter 11 Cases and the Company&#8217;s ability to successfully emerge as a stronger, leaner company may be affected by a number of risks and uncertainties. 
The Company is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties associated with the filing of voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, which may lead to potential adverse effects on the Company&#8217;s liquidity, results of operations or business prospects. No assurance can be given as to the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases. Risks associated with the Chapter 11 filing may impact all entities constituting the Company and include the following:
Although the Company&#8217;s goal is to file a plan of reorganization, the Company may determine that it is in the best interest of the Company&#8217;s estate to seek Bankruptcy Court approval of a sale of all or a portion of the Company&#8217;s assets pursuant to section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or seek confirmation of a reorganization plan providing for such a sale or other arrangement. Similarly, the Company may determine that it is in the best interest of the Company&#8217;s estate to seek to convert certain of the cases of its jointly-administered subsidiaries to cases under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.
Continued investment, capital needs, restructuring payments and servicing the Company&#8217;s debt require a significant amount of cash and the Company&#8217;s ability to generate cash may be affected by factors beyond the Company&#8217;s control. 
While the Company is not currently paying principal or interest on the Company&#8217;s indebtedness, the Company&#8217;s business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable OSG to fund the Company&#8217;s other liquidity needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, investments and alliances, professional fees in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases and other general corporate requirements.
The Company&#8217;s ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, litigation, regulatory and other factors that are beyond the Company&#8217;s control. No assurance can be given that:
If the Company cannot fund its liquidity needs, the Company will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, and investments and alliances; selling additional assets; restructuring or refinancing the Company&#8217;s debt; or seeking additional equity capital. These actions may be restricted as a result of the Company&#8217;s Chapter 11 filing. Such actions could increase OSG&#8217;s debt, negatively impact customer confidence in the Company&#8217;s ability to provide products and services, reduce the Company&#8217;s ability to raise additional capital, and delay emergence from Chapter 11 protection and sustained profitability.
The Company may seek to raise cash proceeds from the sale of non-core assets, however, such efforts may not be successful in raising sufficient cash, may be negatively impacted by factors beyond the Company&#8217;s control and may harm the perception of the Company among customers, suppliers and service providers. 
A number of factors could influence the Company&#8217;s ability to successfully raise cash through asset sales, including the approval of the Bankruptcy Court , the process utilized to sell these assets, the number of potential buyers for these assets, the purchase price such buyers are willing to offer for these assets and their capacity to fund the purchase, or the ability of potential buyers to conclude transactions and potential issues in the closing of transactions due to regulatory or governmental review process. One or more of these factors could negatively affect the timing of planned asset sales and the level of cash proceeds derived from the sales, which could adversely impact the Company&#8217;s cash generation and liquidity. The value of the Company&#8217;s International Flag vessels has declined due to market conditions that began in 2008 and continue to date. As a result, the Company may be unable to receive adequate consideration for any vessel or other asset disposition in the International Flag business, which dispositions may result in significant losses. Further, there is no assurance that these plans will be successful in raising sufficient cash proceeds or that the sale of certain of the Company&#8217;s assets will not harm the Company&#8217;s customers&#8217;, suppliers&#8217; and service providers&#8217; perception of the Company.
If the Company is unsuccessful with its strategic investment decisions, the Company&#8217;s financial performance could be adversely affected. 
The Company has focused its investments on International Flag Crude Tankers, International Flag Product Carrier and U.S. Flag vessels. While the Company believes that each of these businesses has significant growth potential, they all also require potentially significant additional investments. If the Company is unsuccessful in growing the Company&#8217;s businesses as planned, the Company&#8217;s financial performance and cash flows could be adversely affected.
The Company&#8217;s failure to implement plans to reduce the Company&#8217;s cost structure could negatively affect the Company&#8217;s consolidated results of operations, financial position and liquidity. 
The Company recognizes the need to continually rationalize the Company&#8217;s workforce and streamline the Company&#8217;s operations to remain competitive in the face of a difficult business and economic climate. If the Company fails to implement cost rationalization plans, the Company&#8217;s operational results, financial position and liquidity could be negatively impacted. Additionally, if reorganization plans are not effectively managed the Company may experience a loss of customers, reduced business opportunities and other unanticipated effects, causing harm to the Company&#8217;s business and customer relationships The business plan that may be adopted in connection with the Company&#8217;s Chapter 11 reorganization will be subject to a number of assumptions, projections, and analyses. If any of these assumptions prove to be incorrect, the Company may be unsuccessful in executing the Company&#8217;s plan, which could adversely impact its financial results and liquidity. Additionally, the Company&#8217;s ability to execute restructuring with the entities filing for Chapter 11 is subject to the approval by the Bankruptcy Court. Finally, the timing and implementation of these plans require compliance with numerous laws and regulations, and the failure to comply with such requirements may result in damages, fines and penalties which could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s cost structure and cash flows.
Any plan of reorganization that the Company may implement will be based in large part upon assumptions and analyses developed by the Company. If these assumptions and analyses prove to be incorrect, the Company&#8217;s plan may be unsuccessful in its execution. 
Any plan of reorganization that OSG may implement could affect both its capital structure and the ownership, structure and operation of its businesses and will reflect assumptions and analyses based on the Company&#8217;s experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors that are considered appropriate under the circumstances. Whether actual future results and developments will be consistent with the Company&#8217;s expectations and assumptions depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to (i) OSG&#8217;s ability to change substantially its capital structure; (ii) the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain adequate liquidity and financing sources; (iii) the Company&#8217;s ability to maintain customers&#8217; confidence in our viability as a continuing entity and to attract and retain sufficient business from them; (iv) the Company&#8217;s ability to retain key employees, and (v) the overall strength and stability of general economic conditions of the financial and shipping industries, both in the U.S. and in global markets. The failure of any of these factors could materially adversely affect the successful reorganization of our businesses.
In addition, any plan of reorganization will rely upon financial projections, including with respect to revenues, EBITDA, debt service and cash flow. Financial forecasts are inherently speculative, and it is likely that one or more of the assumptions and estimates that are the basis of these financial forecasts will not be accurate. In the Company&#8217;s case, the forecasts are even more speculative than normal because they involve fundamental changes in the nature of the Company&#8217;s capital structure. Accordingly, the Company expects that its actual financial condition and results of operations will differ, perhaps materially, from what such forecasts anticipate. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the results or developments contemplated by any plan of reorganization the Company may implement will occur or, even if they do occur, that they will have the anticipated effects on the Company and its subsidiaries or businesses or operations. The failure of any such results or developments to materialize as anticipated could materially adversely affect the successful execution of any plan of reorganization.
If the Company cannot attract, retain and motivate key employees, the Company&#8217;s revenue and earnings could be harmed. 
In order for the Company to be successful, the Company must continue to attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees, including technical, managerial, chartering and support positions. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, maritime professionals, and qualified chartering representatives is critical to the Company&#8217;s future. If the Company cannot attract qualified individuals, retain key executives and employees or motivate the Company&#8217;s employees, the Company&#8217;s business could be harmed. The Company&#8217;s filing for Chapter 11 may create uncertainty for employees and impact OSG&#8217;s ability to retain key employees and effectively recruit new employees. The Company&#8217;s ability to take measures to motivate and retain key employees is also subject to restrictions while operating under Chapter 11. The Company may experience increased levels of employee attrition.
The Company may be required to recognize additional impairments in the value of the Company&#8217;s goodwill and/or other long-lived assets, which would increase expenses and reduce profitability . 
Goodwill represents the excess of the amount the Company paid to acquire businesses over the fair value of their net assets at the date of the acquisition. The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Additionally, the Company&#8217;s other long-lived assets, such as vessels, are evaluated for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Either of these situations may occur for various reasons including changes in actual or expected income or cash. Impairment charges of $279,382 and $28,783 were recorded in 2012 and 2010, respectively. Impairments could occur in the future if market or interest rate environments deteriorate, expected future cash flows of the Company&#8217;s vessels decline, or if reporting unit carrying values change materially compared with changes in respective fair values.
Even if a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization is consummated, continued weakness or worsening of economic conditions could continue to adversely affect the Company&#8217;s financial performance and the Company&#8217;s liquidity. 
The global economic recession affecting the international tanker industry adversely affected the Company&#8217;s operating results and financial condition and was a primary factor leading to the Company filing for voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Further, global financial markets have been experiencing contraction and volatility, especially with respect to key lenders to shipping companies. Economic conditions could also accelerate the continuing decline in demand for vessels, placing pressure on the Company&#8217;s results of operations and liquidity. If the global economic weakness and tightness in the credit markets continue for a greater period of time than anticipated or worsen, the Company&#8217;s profitability and related cash generation capability could be adversely affected and, therefore, affect the Company&#8217;s ability to meet the Company&#8217;s anticipated cash needs, impair the Company&#8217;s liquidity or increase the Company&#8217;s costs of borrowing.
As the Company streamlines its operations and reduces its general and administrative expenses, it needs to upgrade its management infrastructure and systems to maintain the quality of its operations and satisfaction of its customers. 
In connection with its Chapter 11 Cases, the Company has embarked on several initiatives to streamline its operations and reduce its general and administrative expenses, including reducing levels of management, increasing responsibilities of key personnel and centralizing its financial data operations. These initiatives have the inherent risk that implementation adversely impacts the Company&#8217;s control of the quality of its operations. Although it is impossible to predict what errors might occur as the result of inadequate controls or reduced staff, it is harder to manage a sizable operation with fewer personnel and, accordingly, it is more likely that errors will occur unless management infrastructure and systems are upgraded and monitored.
The commencement and prosecution of the Chapter 11 Cases has consumed and will continue to consume a substantial portion of the time and attention of the Company&#8217;s management and will impact how its business is conducted, which may have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business and results of operations. 
The requirements of the Chapter 11 Cases have consumed and will continue to consume a substantial portion of the Company&#8217;s management&#8217;s time and attention and leave them with less time to devote to the operation of the Company&#8217;s business. This diversion of attention may materially adversely affect the conduct of OSG&#8217;s business, and, as a result, have an adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the Chapter 11 Cases are protracted.
As a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, OSG&#8217;s historical financial information may not be indicative of OSG&#8217;s future financial performance. 
The Company&#8217;s capital structure will likely be significantly altered under any plan of reorganization ultimately confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court. Under fresh-start reporting rules that may apply to the Company upon the effective date of any reorganization plan the Company may adopt, the Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities would be adjusted to fair values and the Company&#8217;s retained earnings would be restated to zero. Accordingly, if fresh-start reporting rules apply, the Company&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations following its emergence from Chapter 11 would not be comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in the Company&#8217;s historical financial statements. In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, it is also possible that additional restructuring and related charges may be identified and recorded in future periods. Such charges could be material to OSG&#8217;s consolidated financial position and results of operations in any given period. Finally, the structure of any reorganization may cause the Company&#8217;s financial conditions and results of operations following its emergence from Chapter 11 not to be comparable to the Company&#8217;s historical financial information.
The Company&#8217;s common stock is no longer listed on a national securities exchange and is quoted only in the over-the-counter market, which could negatively affect the stock price and liquidity. 
Until the Company&#8217;s voluntary Chapter 11 filing on November 14, 2012, the shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock were listed on the NYSE under the symbol &#8220;OSG.&#8221; Upon the announcement of the Chapter 11 filing, the NYSE suspended the trading of the Company&#8217;s shares and the common stock commenced trading on the OTC market under the trading symbol &#8220;OSGIQ.&#8221; However, the extent of the public market for the common stock and the continued availability of quotations depend upon such factors as the aggregate market value of the common stock, the interest in maintaining a market in OSG&#8217;s common stock on the part of securities firms and other factors. The over-the-counter market is a significantly more limited market than the NYSE, and the quotation of OSG&#8217;s common stock in the over-the-counter market may result in a less liquid market available for existing and potential shareholders to trade shares of OSG&#8217;s common stock. This could further depress the trading price of the common stock and could also have a long-term adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s ability to raise capital. There can be no assurance that any public market for the common stock will exist in the future.
Trading in the Company&#8217;s securities during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. It is impossible to predict at this time whether or when the holders of the common stock of the Company or any of its other debt securities will receive any distribution with respect to, or be able to recover any portion of, their investments. 
Under the priority scheme established by the Bankruptcy Code, unless creditors agree otherwise, post-petition liabilities and pre-petition liabilities must be satisfied in full before shareholders are entitled to receive any distribution or retain any property under a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization. The ultimate recovery to creditors and/or shareholders, if any, will not be determined until confirmation of such a plan. No assurance can be given as to what values, if any, will be ascribed in the Chapter 11 Cases to each of these constituencies or what types or amounts of distributions, if any, they would receive. If certain requirements of the Bankruptcy Code are met, the plan can be confirmed notwithstanding its rejection by the class comprising the interests of Company equity security holders.
In the event of cancellation of the Company&#8217;s equity or other debt securities, amounts invested by the holders of such securities will not be recoverable and such securities would have no value. Trading prices for the Company&#8217;s equity or other debt securities may bear little or no relationship to the actual recovery, if any, by the holders thereof in the Chapter 11 Cases. Accordingly, the Company urges extreme caution with respect to existing and future investments in OSG&#8217;s equity or other securities.
In addition, the Bankruptcy Court has entered two orders that place certain limitations on trading in certain of our securities to protect the Company&#8217;s net operating loss (&#8220;NOL&#8221;) carryforwards, a tax asset of the Company, both prior to and potentially in connection with a bankruptcy plan of reorganization. For this reason, under one such order, investors need the Company&#8217;s consent or court approval before effecting any transactions in common stock of the Company if they hold, or would as a result of the transaction hold, at least 4.7% of the outstanding shares of such common stock. Under the other order, any person or entity that beneficially own claims against the Company totaling more than either (i) $25 million in aggregate of the 8.75% Debentures due 2013, the 8.125% Senior Notes due 2018, or the 7.5% Senior Notes due 2024, (ii) $67.5 million under that certain Credit Agreement dated as of February 9, 2006, or (iii) $90 million of any unsecured claims against the Company including those in the previous two categories, where each dollar amount is subject to revision by further notice from the Company (each, a &#8220;Substantial Claimholder&#8221;), may be required, pursuant to a subsequent motion of the Company and Bankruptcy Court order, either to seek the Company&#8217;s consent before effecting any further acquisition of claims against the Company, or to &#8220;sell down&#8221; a portion of its claims against the Company prior to a bankruptcy reorganization.
Transfers or issuances of our equity, or a debt restructuring, may impair or reduce our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes in the future. 
Pursuant to U.S. tax rules, a corporation is generally permitted to deduct from taxable income in any year NOLs carried forward from prior years. Our ability to utilize these NOL carryforwards could be subject to a significant limitation if we were to undergo an &#8220;ownership change&#8221; for purposes of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, during or as a result of our Chapter 11 Cases. The Bankruptcy Court has entered orders that place certain restrictions on trading in OSG common shares, and other procedures relating to trading in claims against OSG, during the Chapter 11 Cases. However, we can provide no assurances that these limitations will prevent an &#8220;ownership change&#8221; or that our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards may not be significantly limited as a result of our reorganization.
A restructuring of our debt pursuant to the Chapter 11 Cases may give rise to cancellation of debt, i.e. debt forgiveness (&#8220;COD&#8221;), which if it occurs would generally be non-taxable. If the COD is non-taxable, and we have remaining NOL carryforwards at the end of the tax year in which such COD arises, we will be required to reduce our NOL carryforwards and other attributes such as capital loss carryforwards and tax basis in assets, by an amount equal to the non-recognized COD. Therefore, it is possible that, as a result of the successful completion of plans for the conclusion of the Chapter 11 Cases, we will have a reduction of NOL carryforwards and/or other tax attributes in an amount that cannot be determined at this time and that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position.
The Company has not made any determination with respect to reorganizing its capital structure, and any changes to its capital structure may have a material adverse effect on existing debt and security holders. 
Any reorganization of the Company&#8217;s capital structure may include exchanges of new debt or equity securities for existing securities, and such new debt or equity securities may be issued at different interest rates, payment schedules, and maturities than our existing securities. The Company may also modify or amend its existing securities to the same effect. Such exchanges or modifications are inherently complex to implement. The success of a reorganization, through any such exchanges or modifications will depend on approval by the Bankruptcy Court and the willingness of existing security holders to agree to the exchange or modification, and there can be no guarantee of success. If such exchanges or modifications are successful, holders of debt may find their holdings no longer have any value or are materially reduced in value, or they may be converted to equity and be diluted or receive debt with a principal amount that is less than the outstanding principal amount, longer maturities, and reduced interest rates. There can be no assurance that any new debt or equity securities will maintain their value at the time of issuance. Also, if the existing debt or equity security holders are adversely affected by a reorganization, it may adversely affect the Company&#8217;s ability to issue new debt or equity in the future.
The Company may not be able to obtain confirmation of a reorganization. 
In order for the Company to emerge successfully from the Chapter 11 Cases as a viable entity, the Company, like any other Chapter 11 debtor, must obtain approval of a reorganization plan from its creditors and confirmation of a plan of reorganization through the Bankruptcy Court, and then successfully implement the plan of reorganization. The foregoing process requires the Company to (i) meet certain statutory requirements with respect to the adequacy of the disclosure statement relating to the plan of reorganization, (ii) solicit and obtain acceptances from creditors whose rights are impaired by the plan of reorganization and (iii) fulfill other statutory conditions with respect to the confirmation of the plan of reorganization. There can be no assurance that a reorganization plan proposed by the Company&#8217;s management will be approved by the Company&#8217;s creditors and confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court. In addition, the Bankruptcy Code imposes time limits on the period during which the Company&#8217;s management has the exclusive right to propose and solicit acceptances of a plan of reorganization. Extensions of this time period are subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court. In addition, there remains a risk that creditors could seek to terminate such exclusivity and propose competing plans of reorganization without the input or consent of the Company&#8217;s management.
There can be no assurance as to the timing of the acceptance or confirmation of a reorganization plan or that any conditions to the plan&#8217;s effectiveness will ever occur. The impact that prolonging completion of the Chapter 11 Cases may have on the Company&#8217;s operations cannot be accurately predicted or quantified. The continuation of the Chapter 11 Cases, particularly if the plan is not approved, confirmed, or implemented within the time frame proposed by management, or in the event that competing creditor plans are filed or proposed, could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s operations and relationships between the Company and its customers and charterers, suppliers, service providers and creditors as well as the viability of the Company&#8217;s joint venture interests; result in increased professional fees and similar expenses; and threaten the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain financing. Failure to confirm the plan or any delay of its effectiveness could further weaken the Company&#8217;s liquidity position, which could jeopardize the Company&#8217;s exit from Chapter 11, force the sale of the Company or certain of its material assets or result in the appointment of a trustee and/or conversion of the Company&#8217;s Chapter 11 Cases to a liquidation under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.
Industry specific risk factors: 
The highly cyclical nature of the industry may lead to volatile changes in charter rates and vessel values, which may adversely affect the Company&#8217;s earnings. 
Factors affecting the supply and demand for vessels are outside of the Company&#8217;s control, and the nature, timing and degree of changes in industry conditions are unpredictable and may adversely affect the values of the Company&#8217;s vessels and result in significant fluctuations in the amount of charter hire the Company may earn, which could result in significant fluctuations in OSG&#8217;s quarterly results and cash flows. The factors that influence the demand for tanker capacity include:
The factors that influence the supply of vessel capacity include:
The market value of vessels fluctuates significantly, which could adversely affect OSG&#8217;s liquidity or otherwise adversely affect its financial condition. 
The market value of vessels has fluctuated over time. The fluctuation in market value of vessels over time is based upon various factors, including:
Vessel values have declined during the past few years. As vessels grow older, they generally decline in value. These factors will affect the value of the Company&#8217;s vessels at the time of any vessel sale. If OSG sells a vessel at a sale price that is less than the vessel&#8217;s carrying amount on its financial statements, the Company will incur a loss on the sale and a reduction in earnings and surplus. In addition, declining values of the Company&#8217;s vessels could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s liquidity by limiting its ability to raise cash by refinancing vessels.
An increase in the supply of vessels without a commensurate increase in demand for such vessels could cause charter rates to remain at depressed levels or to further decline, which could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s revenues, profitability and cash flows and on the value of its vessels. 
OSG depends on short term duration or &#8220;spot&#8221; charters, for a significant portion of its revenues, further exposing OSG to fluctuations in market conditions. In 2012, 2011 and 2010, OSG derived approximately 64%, 65% and 64%, respectively, of its TCE revenues in the spot market.
The marine transportation industry has been highly cyclical, as the profitability and asset values of companies in the industry have fluctuated based on changes in the supply and demand of vessels. If the number of new ships delivered exceeds the number of vessels being scrapped, capacity will increase. Historically, we have generally seen the supply of vessels increase with deliveries of new vessels and decreases with the scrapping of older vessels. The newbuilding order book equaled 12% of the existing world tanker fleet as of December 31, 2012, down from 18% and 29% as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.
In addition, vessel supply is affected by the number of vessels that are used for floating storage because vessels that are used for storage are not available to transport crude oil and petroleum products. Utilization of vessels for storage is affected by expectations of changes in the price of oil and petroleum products, with utilization generally increasing if prices are expected to increase more than storage costs and generally decreasing if they are not. A reduction in vessel utilization for storage will generally increase vessel supply. For example, in 2010, 81 vessels were released from storage and reentered the trading fleet. Since the 2010 release, storage on vessels at sea has been low, in part because then current prices of crude oil have generally exceeded the future prices, a condition which allows companies to replace inventories at lower prices, encouraging the drawdown of commercial inventories. Supply has exceeded demand during the past four years, resulting in lower charter rates across the industry. If this trend continues, the charter rates for the Company&#8217;s vessels could continue at current depressed levels that are well below historical averages, which would have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s revenues, profitability and cash flows if sustained over a long period of time.
Shipping is a business with inherent risks, and OSG&#8217;s insurance may not be adequate to cover its losses. 
OSG&#8217;s vessels and their cargoes are at risk of being damaged or lost because of events including, but not limited to:
In addition, transporting crude oil creates a risk of business interruptions due to political circumstances in foreign countries, hostilities, labor strikes, port closings and boycotts. Any of these events may result in loss of revenues, decreased cash flows and increased costs.
While the Company carries insurance to protect against certain risks involved in the conduct of its business, risks may arise against which the Company is not adequately insured. For example, a catastrophic spill could exceed OSG&#8217;s $1 billion per vessel insurance coverage and have a material adverse effect on its operations. In addition, OSG may not be able to procure adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates in the future, and OSG cannot guarantee that any particular claim will be paid by its insurers. In the past, new and stricter environmental regulations have led to higher costs for insurance covering environmental damage or pollution, and new regulations could lead to similar increases or even make this type of insurance unavailable. Furthermore, even if insurance coverage is adequate to cover the Company&#8217;s losses, OSG may not be able to timely obtain a replacement ship in the event of a loss. OSG may also be subject to calls, or premiums, in amounts based not only on its own claim records but also the claim records of all other members of the protection and indemnity associations through which OSG obtains insurance coverage for tort liability. OSG&#8217;s payment of these calls could result in significant expenses which would reduce its profits and cash flows or cause losses.
Constraints on capital availability adversely affect the tanker industry and OSG&#8217;s business. 
Constraints on capital that have occurred during recent years have adversely affected the financial condition of certain of the Company&#8217;s customers, joint venture partners, financial lenders and suppliers, including shipyards from whom the Company has contracted to purchase vessels. Entities that suffer a material adverse impact on their financial condition may be unable or unwilling to comply with their contractual commitments to OSG including the refusal or inability of customers to pay charter hire to OSG, failure of shipyards to construct and deliver to OSG newbuilds or the inability or unwillingness of joint venture partners or financial lenders to honor their commitments to contribute funds to a joint venture or lend funds. While OSG seeks to monitor the financial condition of such entities, the availability and accuracy of information about the financial condition of such entities and the actions that OSG may take to reduce possible losses resulting from the failure of such entities to comply with their contractual obligations may be limited. Such failure of customers, joint venture partners, financial lenders and suppliers to meet their contractual obligations may have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s revenues, profitability and cash flows. In addition, adverse financial conditions may inhibit customers, joint venture partners, financial lenders and suppliers from entering into new commitments with OSG, which could have a material adverse effect on revenues, profitability and cash flows.
See also &#8220;&#8212;Company specific risk factors&#8212;The Company is subject to credit risks with respect to its counterparties on contracts and failure of such counterparties to meet their obligations could cause the Company to suffer losses on such contracts, decreasing revenues and earnings&#8221; and &#8220;&#8212;Company specific risk factors&#8212;OSG has incurred significant indebtedness which could affect its ability to finance its operations, pursue desirable business opportunities and successfully run its business in the future, and therefore make it more difficult for OSG to fulfill its obligations under its indebtedness.&#8221;
Acts of piracy on ocean-going vessels could adversely affect our business. 
The frequency of pirate attacks on seagoing vessels remains high, particularly in the western part of the Indian Ocean and off the west coast of Africa. If piracy attacks result in regions in which the company&#8217;s vessels are deployed being characterized by insurers as &#8220;war risk&#8221; zones, as the Gulf of Aden has been, or Joint War Committee &#8220;war and strikes&#8221; listed areas, premiums payable for such insurance coverage could increase significantly and such insurance coverage may be more difficult to obtain. Crew costs and costs of employing onboard security guards could also increase in such circumstances.
In addition, while OSG believes the charterer remains liable for charter payments when a vessel is seized by pirates, the charterer may dispute this and withhold charter hire until the vessel is released. A charterer may also claim that a vessel seized by pirates was not &#8220;on-hire&#8221; for a certain number of days and it is therefore entitled to cancel the charter party, a claim that the Company would dispute. We may not be adequately insured to cover losses from these incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, hijacking as a result of an act of piracy against the Company&#8217;s vessels, or an increase in cost, or unavailability of insurance for its vessels, could have a material adverse impact on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Terrorist attacks and international hostilities and instability can affect the tanker industry, which could adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business. 
Terrorist attacks, the outbreak of war, or the existence of international hostilities could damage the world economy, adversely affect the availability of and demand for crude oil and petroleum products and adversely affect the Company&#8217;s ability to charter its vessels and the charter rates payable under any charters. Additionally, OSG operates in a sector of the economy that is likely to be adversely impacted by the effects of political instability, terrorist or other attacks, war or international hostilities. These factors could also increase the costs to OSG of conducting its business, particularly crew, insurance and security costs, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s profitability and cash flows.
OSG conducts its operations internationally, subjecting the Company to changing economic, political and governmental conditions abroad which may adversely affect our business. 
The Company conducts its operations internationally, and its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected by changing economic, political and government conditions in the countries and regions where its vessels are employed, including
The occurrence of such events could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, OSG&#8217;s international operations subject it to certain risks regarding taxation of foreign subsidiary income, see &#8220;&#8212;Company specific risk factors&#8212; OSG&#8217;s financial condition would be materially adversely affected if the shipping income of OSG&#8217;s foreign subsidiaries becomes subject to current taxation in the U.S.&#8221;
Our vessels may be directed to call on ports located in countries that are subject to restrictions imposed by the U.S. government, which could negatively affect the trading price of our common shares. 
From time to time, certain of our vessels, on the instructions of the charterers or pool manager responsible for the commercial management of such vessels, have called and may again call on ports located in countries subject to sanctions and embargoes imposed by the U.S. government, the UN or the EU and countries identified by the U.S. government, the UN or the EU as state sponsors of terrorism. The U.S., UN and EU sanctions and embargo laws and regulations vary in their application, as they do not all apply to the same covered persons or proscribe the same activities, and such sanctions and embargo laws and regulations may be amended or strengthened over time. Some sanctions may also apply to transportation of goods (including crude oil) originating in sanctioned countries (particularly Iran), even if the vessel does not travel to those countries, or otherwise acting on behalf of sanctioned persons. Sanctions may include the imposition of penalties and fines against companies violating national law or threaten that companies acting outside the jurisdiction of the sanctioning power may themselves become the target of sanctions.
Non-U.S. subsidiaries of OSG contributed VLCCs they owned or chartered-in to Tankers International (&#8220;TI&#8221;), a commercial pool that charters out vessels which in turn call on ports throughout the world in compliance with applicable law. The Company learns where a vessel contributed by one of its non-U.S. subsidiaries has or will be traded after the voyage has been fixed.
In early 2012, TI pool vessels made five port calls in Iran, in compliance with applicable law, including one port call made by a vessel owned by a non-U.S. subsidiary of OSG in January 2012. Even when these vessels, including the one owned by a non-U.S. subsidiary of OSG, called on an Iranian ports, neither the Company itself nor any of its U.S person affiliates or employees had any role or involvement with TI pool transactions involving Iran. As a participant in the pool, the Company receives a share of the TI pool&#8217;s net revenues from a voyage based on its contribution of vessels to the TI pool, regardless of whether the voyage was performed by a vessel contributed by one of its non-U.S. subsidiaries or by another pool participant. OSG&#8217;s share of the TI pool&#8217;s net revenue (after deducting OSG&#8217;s share of administrative costs) for 2012 derived from all voyages of all TI Pool vessels involving a port call in Iran totaled approximately $1,318. The TI pool decided to terminate all new business involving Iranian ports in February 2012 after the EU adopted sanctions on such activity. No vessel owned or chartered-in by OSG or any of its domestic or foreign subsidiaries has called on an Iranian port since January 2012, and until the U.S. and EU sanctions regimes permit such calls, the Company will not allow its vessels to make such calls, whether through a pooling arrangement or otherwise.
Although we believe that we are in compliance with all applicable sanctions and embargo laws and regulations and intend to maintain such compliance and that we do not and do not intend to engage in sanctionable activity, there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance in the future, particularly as the scope of certain laws may be unclear and may be subject to changing interpretations. Any such violation or sanctionable activity could result in fines or other penalties, or the imposition of sanctions against the Company, and could result in some investors deciding, or being required, to divest their interest, or not to invest, in the Company and negatively affect our reputation and investor perception of the value of our common stock..
Compliance with environmental laws or regulations, including those relating to the emission of greenhouse gases, may adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business. 
The Company&#8217;s operations are affected by extensive and changing international, national and local environmental protection laws, regulations, treaties, conventions and standards in force in international waters, the jurisdictional waters of the countries in which OSG&#8217;s vessels operate, as well as the countries of its vessels&#8217; registration. Many of these requirements are designed to reduce the risk of oil spills. They also regulate other water pollution issues, including discharge of ballast water and effluents and air emissions, including emission of greenhouse gases. These requirements impose significant capital and operating costs on OSG.
Environmental laws and regulations also can affect the resale value or significantly reduce the useful lives of the Company&#8217;s vessels, require a reduction in carrying capacity, ship modifications or operational changes or restrictions, lead to decreased availability or higher cost of insurance coverage for environmental matters or result in the denial of access to, or detention in, certain jurisdictional waters or ports. Under local, national and foreign laws, as well as international treaties and conventions, OSG could incur material liabilities, including cleanup obligations, in the event that there is a release of petroleum or other hazardous substances from its vessels or otherwise in connection with its operations. OSG could also become subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to the release of or exposure to hazardous materials associated with its current or historic operations. Violations of or liabilities under environmental requirements also can result in substantial penalties, fines and other sanctions, including in certain instances, seizure or detention of the Company&#8217;s vessels.
OSG could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs, fines, penalties, third-party claims and natural resource damages, as the result of an oil spill or liabilities under environmental laws. The Company is subject to the oversight of several government agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Maritime Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (&#8220;OPA 90&#8221;) affects all vessel owners shipping oil or hazardous material to, from or within the United States. OPA 90 allows for potentially unlimited liability without regard to fault for owners, operators and bareboat charterers of vessels for oil pollution in U.S. waters. Similarly, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, as amended, which has been adopted by most countries outside of the United States, imposes liability for oil pollution in international waters. OPA 90 expressly permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to hazardous materials and oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries. Coastal states in the United States have enacted pollution prevention liability and response laws, many providing for unlimited liability. Similarly, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, as amended, which has been adopted by most countries outside of the United States, imposes liability for oil pollution in international waters.
In addition, in complying with OPA 90, International Maritime Organization (&#8220;IMO&#8221;) regulations, EU directives and other existing laws and regulations and those that may be adopted, shipowners likely will incur substantial additional capital and/or operating expenditures in meeting new regulatory requirements, in developing contingency arrangements for potential spills and in obtaining insurance coverage. Key regulatory initiatives that are anticipated to require substantial additional capital and/or operating expenditures in the next several years include more stringent limits on the sulfur content of fuel oil for vessels operating in certain areas and more stringent requirements for management and treatment of ballast water. See the discussion of &#8220;Environmental and Security Matters Relating to Bulk Shipping&#8221; above. Other government regulation of vessels, particularly in the areas of safety and environmental requirements, can be expected to become more strict in the future and require the Company to incur significant capital expenditures on its vessels to keep them in compliance, or even to scrap or sell certain vessels altogether. Such expenditures could result in financial and operational impacts that may be material to OSG&#8217;s financial statements.
Accidents involving highly publicized oil spills and other mishaps involving vessels can be expected in the tanker industry, and such accidents or other events could be expected to result in the adoption of even stricter laws and regulations, which could limit the Company&#8217;s operations or its ability to do business and which could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial results and cash flows.
Due to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries, including the U.S., and international organizations, including the EU, the IMO and the United Nations, have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These regulatory measures include, among others, adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. Such actions could result in significant financial and operational impacts on the Company&#8217;s business, including requiring OSG to install new emission controls, acquire allowances or pay taxes related to its greenhouse gas emissions, or administer and manage a greenhouse gas emission program. See &#8220;Environmental and Security Matters Relating to Bulk Shipping .&#8221; In addition to the added costs, the concern over climate change and regulatory measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may reduce global demand for oil and oil products, which would have an adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial results and cash flows.
OSG&#8217;s revenues are subject to seasonal variations. 
OSG operates its tankers in markets that have historically exhibited seasonal variations in demand for tanker capacity, and therefore, charter rates. Charter rates for tankers are typically higher in the fall and winter months as a result of increased oil consumption in the Northern Hemisphere. Because a majority of the Company&#8217;s vessels trade in the spot market, seasonality has affected OSG&#8217;s operating results on a quarter-to-quarter basis and could continue to do so in the future. Such seasonality may be outweighed in any period by then current economic conditions or tanker industry fundamentals.
Company specific risk factors: 
OSG has incurred significant indebtedness which could affect its ability to finance its operations, pursue desirable business opportunities and successfully run its business in the future, and therefore make it more difficult for OSG to fulfill its obligations under its indebtedness . 
OSG has, and expects after emergence from Chapter 11 that it will continue to have, significant amounts of indebtedness. Although the Company is seeking to substantially reduce such debt in Chapter 11, it cannot predict if, or to what extent, these efforts will be successful. As of December 31, 2012, OSG had $2.6 billion of indebtedness that had been classified as liabilities subject to compromise. OSG&#8217;s substantial indebtedness and interest expense could have important consequences, including:
OSG&#8217;s ability to continue to fund its obligations and to reduce debt may be affected by general economic, financial market, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, among other things. An inability to fund the Company&#8217;s debt requirements or reduce debt could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
The Company may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of its indebtedness. 
The Company&#8217;s earnings and cash flow vary significantly over time due to the cyclical nature of the tanker industry. As a result, the amount of debt that OSG can manage in some periods may not be appropriate in other periods. Additionally, future cash flow may be insufficient to meet the Company&#8217;s debt obligations and commitments. Any insufficiency could negatively impact OSG&#8217;s business. A range of economic, competitive, financial, business, industry and other factors will affect future financial performance, and, as a result, the Company&#8217;s ability to generate cash flow from operations and to pay debt. Many of these factors, such as charter rates, economic and financial conditions in the tanker industry and the global economy or competitive initiatives of competitors, are beyond the Company&#8217;s control. If OSG does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy its debt obligations, OSG may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as:
No assurance can be given that undertaking alternative financing plans, if necessary, would be successful in allowing OSG to meet its debt obligations. The Company&#8217;s ability to restructure or refinance its debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets, its access thereto and OSG&#8217;s financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of debt could be at higher interest rates and may require the Company to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict OSG&#8217;s business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict OSG from adopting some of these alternatives. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit OSG to meet its scheduled debt service obligations. The Company&#8217;s inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its debt obligations, or to obtain alternative financing, could materially and adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
The Company faces risks arising from potential material weaknesses in its internal control environment. 
As a result of the matters addressed in the recently completed Company inquiry, as further described in Note 2, &#8220;Company Inquiry and Restatement,&#8221; to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, as well as an internal review by Company management, management identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting with respect to its accounting for income taxes and fair market valuation of interest rates. While management has taken remediation actions to address material weaknesses, its remediation actions may prove to be ineffective or inadequate and expose the Company to further risk of misstatements in its financial statements. In such circumstances, investors and other users of the Company&#8217;s financial statements may lose confidence in the reliability of the Company&#8217;s financial information and the Company could fail to comply with certain representations, warranties and covenants in its debt and other financing-related agreements or be obligated to incur additional costs to improve the internal controls. The Company&#8217;s failure or inability to remediate the material weakness in a timely and effective manner could also adversely affect its reputation among customers and its operating prospects, if customers perceive the Company as experiencing financial control or other financial difficulties. See Item 9A, &#8220;Controls and Procedures,&#8221; for further description of the material weaknesses identified by management and related remediation actions.
Litigation and regulatory inquiries associated with the restatement of the Company&#8217;s prior period financial statements could result in substantial costs, penalties and other adverse effects. 
Substantial costs may be incurred to defend and resolve regulatory proceedings and litigation arising out of or relating to matters addressed in the recently completed Company inquiry. These proceedings include the ongoing audits that are in process by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) in the U.S. as well as audits expected to commence of the Company&#8217;s U.S. federal income tax returns for some of the periods affected by the restatement. In completing the restatement, the Company examined the appropriateness of the Company&#8217;s accounting treatment of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the credit agreements for which OIN was a co-obligor with the Company on a joint and several basis. In conducting this analysis, the Company also determined that additional financial statement reserves were required with respect to certain other lesser tax compliance matters, including intercompany balances between OIN and the Company that gave rise to deemed dividend income to the Company. The Company cannot predict when the ongoing IRS audits will be completed or the amount or timing of the final resolution with the IRS or other relevant taxing authorities of the matters that gave rise to the restatement. Further, the Company has not recorded penalties related to the ongoing IRS audits. Penalties, if imposed, may be material.
The Company is also subject to other regulatory and litigation proceedings relating to, or arising out of, the restatement, including a pending investigation by the SEC and purported securities class action lawsuits seeking relief against certain of the Company&#8217;s officers and its directors. These proceedings could also result in civil or criminal fines and other non-monetary penalties. The Company has not reserved any amount in respect of these matters in its consolidated financial statements.
The Company cannot predict whether any monetary losses it experiences in the proceedings will be covered by insurance or whether insurance proceeds recovered will be sufficient to offset such losses. Pending civil, regulatory and criminal proceedings may also divert the efforts and attention of the Company&#8217;s management from business operations, particularly if adverse developments are experienced in any of them, such as an expansion of the investigations being conducted by the SEC. See Item 3, &#8220;Legal Proceedings,&#8221; for further discussion of these pending matters.
The Company&#8217;s business would be adversely affected if it failed to comply with the Jones Act provisions on coastwise trade, or if these provisions were repealed and if changes in international trade agreements were to occur. 
The Company is subject to the Jones Act and other federal laws that restrict maritime transportation between points in the United States (known as marine cabotage services or coastwise trade) to vessels built and registered in the United States and owned and manned by U.S. citizens. The Company is responsible for monitoring the foreign ownership of its common stock and other interests to ensure compliance with the Jones Act. If the Company does not comply with these restrictions, it would be prohibited from operating its vessels in U.S. coastwise trade, and under certain circumstances would be deemed to have undertaken an unapproved foreign transfer, resulting in severe penalties, including permanent loss of U.S. coastwise trading rights for the Company&#8217;s vessels, fines or forfeiture of the vessels.
In order to ensure compliance with Jones Act citizenship requirements, and in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a requirement in July 1976 that at least 77% (the &#8220;Minimum Percentage&#8221;) of the Company&#8217;s common stock must be held by U.S. citizens. While the percentage of U.S. citizenship ownership of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common stock fluctuates daily, at times in the past several years it has declined to the Minimum Percentage. Any purported transfer of common stock in violation of these ownership provisions will be ineffective to transfer the shares of common stock or any voting, dividend or other rights associated with them. The existence and enforcement of this U.S. citizen ownership requirement could have an adverse impact on the liquidity or market value of our common stock in the event that U.S. citizens were unable to transfer shares of our common stock to non-U.S. citizens. Furthermore, under certain circumstances this ownership requirement could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company.
Additionally, the Jones Act restrictions on the provision of maritime cabotage services are subject to exceptions under certain international trade agreements, including the General Agreement on Trade in Services (&#8220;GATS&#8221;) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (&#8220;NAFTA&#8221;). If maritime cabotage services were included in GATS, NAFTA or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise repealed or altered, the transportation of maritime cargo between U.S. ports could be opened to international flag or international-manufactured vessels. During the past several years, interest groups have lobbied Congress to repeal the Jones Act to facilitate international flag competition for trades and cargoes currently reserved for U.S. Flag vessels under the Jones Act and cargo preference laws. The Company believes that continued efforts will be made to modify or repeal the Jones Act and cargo preference laws currently benefiting U.S. Flag vessels. Because international vessels may have lower construction costs, wage rates and operating costs, this could significantly increase competition in the coastwise trade, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
OSG may not be able to renew time charters when they expire or enter into new time charters for newbuilds. 
There can be no assurance that any of the Company&#8217;s existing time charters will be renewed at comparable rates or if renewed or entered into, that they will be at favorable rates. If, upon expiration of the existing time charters or delivery of newbuilds, OSG is unable to obtain time charters or voyage charters at desirable rates, the Company&#8217;s profitability and cash flows may be adversely affected.
Delays or cost overruns in building new vessels, including delivery of any new vessels, the scheduled shipyard maintenance of the Company&#8217;s existing vessels, or conversion of the Company&#8217;s existing vessels could adversely affect OSG&#8217;s results of operations. 
Building new vessels, scheduled shipyard maintenance or conversion of vessels are subject to risks of delay (including the failure of suppliers to deliver new vessels) or cost overruns caused by circumstances including but not limited to, the following:
Significant delays and cost overruns could increase the Company&#8217;s expected contract commitments, which would have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s revenues, borrowing capacity and results of operations. Furthermore, delays would result in vessels being out-of-service for extended periods of time, and therefore not earning revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations, including cash flows. The Company&#8217;s remedies for losses resulting from shipyards&#8217; failure to comply with their contractual commitments may be limited by such contracts, certain of which contain liquidated damages provisions that limit the amount of monetary damages that may be claimed or that limit the Company&#8217;s right to cancellation of the building contract. While purchase price payments for newbuild vessels made prior to vessel delivery to international shipyards are generally supported by guarantees from financial institutions, such as banks or insurance companies, such payments to U.S. shipyards historically have been supported by liens on the work in progress, including steel and equipment used for constructing the vessel, and not by guarantees from financial institutions. Due to these conventions, if a U.S. shipyard fails to deliver a contracted vessel, the Company&#8217;s investment may be supported only by the Company&#8217;s liens on the work in progress, which may result in a loss of part or all of the Company&#8217;s investment. Even with a financial institution guarantee, the Company may not be able to recover in a timely matter, or at all, its loss resulting from a shipyard&#8217;s failure to deliver.
Termination or change in the nature of OSG&#8217;s relationship with any of the pools in which it participates could adversely affect its business. 
As of May 31, 2013, all but two of the Company&#8217;s Very Large Crude Carriers (&#8220;VLCCs&#8221;) participate in the Tankers International pool. At December 31, 2012, ten of OSG&#8217;s Aframaxes participate in the Aframax International pool. Five of the Company&#8217;s crude Panamaxes and two of its Panamax Product Carriers participate directly in Panamax International. Participation in these pools is intended to enhance the financial performance of the Company&#8217;s vessels as a result of the higher vessel utilization. Any participant in any of these pools has the right to withdraw upon notice in accordance with the relevant pool agreement. The Company cannot predict whether the pools in which its vessels operate will continue to exist in the future. After the Chapter 11 filing, some participants in the pools have withdrawn or announced their intention to withdraw from pools in which OSG participates, or subjected OSG to trading restrictions within the pools. In addition, in recent years the EU has published guidelines on the application of the EU antitrust rules to traditional agreements for maritime services such as pools. While the Company believes that all the pools it participates in comply with EU rules, there has been limited administrative and judicial interpretation of the rules. Restrictive interpretations of the guidelines could adversely affect the ability to commercially market the respective types of vessels in pools.
In the highly competitive international market, OSG may not be able to compete effectively for charters with companies with greater resources 
The Company&#8217;s vessels are employed in a highly competitive market. Competition arises from other vessel owners, including major oil companies, which may have substantially greater resources than OSG does. Competition for the transportation of crude oil and other petroleum products depends on price, location, size, age, condition, and the acceptability of the vessel operator to the charterer. The Company believes that because ownership of the world tanker fleet is highly fragmented, no single vessel owner is able to influence charter rates. To the extent OSG enters into new geographic regions or provides new services, it may not be able to compete profitably. New markets may involve competitive factors that differ from those of the Company&#8217;s current markets, and the competitors in those markets may have greater financial strength and capital resources than OSG does.
Changes in demand in specialized markets in which the Company currently trades may lead the Company to redeploy certain vessels to other markets. 
The Company deploys its vessels in several specialized markets, including, without limitation, lightering in the Delaware Bay. The Company conducts those lightering operations with two ATBs, which were constructed using funds withdrawn from the Company&#8217;s Capital Construction Fund (&#8220;CCF&#8221;). If lower demand in these markets adversely affects the Company&#8217;s financial position, the Company may consider redeploying these two ATBs in other markets. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete profitably in the new markets or that the ATBs can be fixed in new markets without substantial modification.
Operating costs and capital expenses will increase as the Company&#8217;s vessels age. 
In general, capital expenditures and other costs necessary for maintaining a vessel in good operating condition increase as the age of the vessel increases. Accordingly, it is likely that the operating costs of OSG&#8217;s vessels will increase. In addition, changes in governmental regulations and compliance with Classification Society standards may require OSG to make additional expenditures for new equipment. In order to add such equipment, OSG may be required to take its vessels out of service. There can be no assurance that market conditions will justify such expenditures or enable OSG to operate its older vessels profitably during the remainder of their economic lives.
Certain potential customers will not use vessels older than a specified age, even if they have been recently rebuilt. 
All of the Company&#8217;s existing articulated tug barges (&#8220;ATBs&#8221;) with the exception of the OSG Vision/OSG 350 and the OSG Horizon/OSG 351were originally constructed more than 25 years ago. While all of these tug-barge units were rebuilt and double-hulled since 1998 and are &#8220;in-class,&#8221; meaning the vessel has been certified by a classification society as being built and maintained in accordance with the rules of that classification society and complies with the applicable rules and regulations of the vessel&#8217;s country of registry and applicable international conventions, some potential customers have stated that they will not charter vessels that are more than 20 years old, even if they have been rebuilt. No assurance can be given that customers will continue to view rebuilt vessels as suitable. If more customers differentiate rebuilt vessels, time charter rates for our rebuilt ATBs will likely be adversely affected or they may not be employable.
The Company is subject to credit risks with respect to its counterparties on contracts and failure of such counterparties to meet their obligations could cause the Company to suffer losses on such contracts, decreasing revenues and earnings. 
The Company charters its vessels to other parties, who pay the Company a daily rate of hire. The Company also enters into contracts of affreightment (&#8220;COAs&#8221;) and Voyage Charters. Historically, the Company has not experienced material problems collecting charter hire but the global economic downturn of recent years has affected charterers more severely than the prior recessions that have occurred since the Company&#8217;s establishment more than 40 years ago. The Company also time charters or bareboat charters some of its vessels from other parties and its continued use and operation of such vessels depends on the vessel owners&#8217; compliance with the terms of the time charter or bareboat charter. Additionally, prior to the Chapter 11 filing and potentially after confirmation of a plan of reorganization, the Company entered into derivative contracts (FFAs, bunker swaps, interest rate swaps and foreign currency contracts). All of these contracts subject the Company to counterparty credit risk. As a result, the Company is subject to credit risks at various levels, including with charterers or cargo interests. If the counterparties fail to meet their obligations, the Company could suffer losses on such contracts which would decrease revenues, cash flows and earnings.
OSG&#8217;s financial condition would be materially adversely affected if the shipping income of OSG&#8217;s foreign subsidiaries becomes subject to current taxation in the U.S. 
As a result of changes made by the American Jobs Creations Act of 2004 (&#8220;2004 Act&#8221;), the Company does not include in its U.S. tax return on a current basis the unrepatriated shipping income earned by its international flag vessels, which in recent years represented substantially all of the Company&#8217;s pre-tax income. These changes in the 2004 Act were made to make U.S. controlled shipping companies competitive with foreign-controlled shipping companies, which are generally incorporated in jurisdictions in which they either do not pay income taxes or pay minimal income taxes. The taxation of OSG&#8217;s foreign subsidiaries under U.S. laws is a complex area and is subject to ongoing analysis and recalculation, which can have a material impact on the Company, see Note 2, &#8220;Company Inquiry and Restatement,&#8221; to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statement and Supplementary Data.&#8221;
The President and several Congressmen and Senators have announced support for repealing certain tax provisions that purportedly incentivize companies to move jobs from the U.S. to foreign countries.. While the Company believes that the changes made in the 2004 Act with respect to foreign shipping income do not &#8220;incentivize moving jobs offshore,&#8221; and, in fact, have enabled the Company to expand its U.S. Flag fleet and create jobs in the U.S., Congress may decide to repeal the changes made in the 2004 Act with respect to taxation of foreign shipping income for the aforementioned reason or as part of initiatives to reduce the U.S. budget deficit or to reform the U.S. corporate tax regime. Such repeal, either directly or indirectly by limiting or reducing benefits received under the 2004 Act, could have a materially adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial results and cash flows.
Trading and complementary hedging activities in Forward Freight Agreements (&#8220;FFAs&#8221;) subject the Company to trading risks and the Company may suffer trading losses that reduce earnings. 
Due to shipping market volatility, success in this industry requires constant adjustment of the balance between chartering out vessels for long periods of time and trading them on a spot basis. The Company seeks to manage and mitigate that risk through trading and complementary hedging activities in forward freight agreements, or FFAs. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be able at all times to successfully protect itself from volatility in the shipping market. The Company may not successfully mitigate its risks, leaving it exposed to unprofitable contracts and may suffer trading losses that reduce earnings and surplus.
The Company does not intend to enter into derivative financial instruments of any type during the pendency of the Chapter 11 proceedings.
The Company may face unexpected drydock costs for its vessels. 
Vessels must be drydocked periodically. The cost of repairs and renewals required at each drydock are difficult to predict with certainty and can be substantial. The Company&#8217;s insurance does not cover these costs. In addition, vessels may have to be drydocked in the event of accidents or other unforeseen damage. OSG&#8217;s insurance may not cover all of these costs. Large drydocking expenses could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s financial results and cash flows.
Maritime claimants could arrest OSG&#8217;s vessels, which could interrupt its cash flow. 
Crew members, suppliers of goods and services to a vessel, shippers of cargo and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against that vessel for unsatisfied debts, claims or damages. In many jurisdictions, a maritime lien holder may enforce its lien by arresting a vessel through foreclosure proceedings. While the Company&#8217;s Chapter 11 filing has provided the Company with an automatic stay against the arrest of a vessel because of an obligation arising before the Chapter 11 filing, and against exercising control over the Company&#8217;s property on a post-petition basis, such stay may not be recognized in a specific jurisdiction, and the stay does not generally apply to obligations arising after the Chapter 11 filing. While the Company has obtained recognition of the Chapter 11 proceedings and the automatic stay in South Africa and in the Courts of England and Wales, the arrest or attachment of one or more of the Company&#8217;s vessels could interrupt OSG&#8217;s cash flow and require it to pay a significant amount of money to have the arrest lifted. In addition, in some jurisdictions, such as South Africa, under the &#8220;sister ship&#8221; theory of liability, a claimant may arrest both the vessel that is subject to the claimant&#8217;s maritime lien and any &#8220;associated&#8221; vessel, which is any vessel owned or controlled by the same owner. Claimants could try to assert &#8220;sister ship&#8221; liability against one vessel in the Company&#8217;s fleet for claims relating to another vessel in its fleet.

OSG,OVERSEAS SHIPHOLDING GROUP INC,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/75208/000114420412011875/0001144204-12-011875.txt,2012-02-29T12:47:12-05:00," ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
The following important risk factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements made in this report or presented elsewhere by management from time to time. If any of the circumstances or events described below actually arise or occur, the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
Industry specific risk factors: 
The highly cyclical nature of the industry may lead to volatile changes in charter rates and vessel values, which may adversely affect the Company&#8217;s earnings 
Factors affecting the supply and demand for vessels are outside of the Company&#8217;s control, and the nature, timing and degree of changes in industry conditions are unpredictable and may adversely affect the values of the Company&#8217;s vessels and result in significant fluctuations in the amount of charter hire the Company may earn, which could result in significant fluctuations in OSG&#8217;s quarterly results. The factors that influence the demand for tanker capacity include:
The factors that influence the supply of vessel capacity include: 
An increase in the supply of vessels without a commensurate increase in demand for such vessels could cause charter rates to remain at depressed levels or to further decline, which could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s revenues and profitability and on the value of its vessels 
OSG depends on spot charters for a significant portion of its revenues. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, OSG derived approximately 65%, 64% and 49%, respectively, of its TCE revenues in the spot market.
The marine transportation industry has been highly cyclical. The profitability and asset values of companies in the industry have fluctuated based on changes in the supply and demand of vessels. The supply of vessels generally increases with deliveries of new vessels and decreases with the scrapping of older vessels. The newbuilding order book equaled 18% of the existing world tanker fleet as of December 31, 2011, a significant percentage but a decrease from 29% and 31% as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
If the number of new ships delivered exceeds the number of vessels being scrapped, capacity will increase. In addition, vessel supply is affected by the number of vessels that are used for floating storage because vessels that are used for storage are not available to transport crude oil and petroleum products. Utilization of vessels for storage is affected by expectations of changes in the price of oil and products, such utilization generally increasing if prices are expected to increase more than storage costs and generally decreasing if they are not. A reduction in vessel utilization for storage, which occurred in 2010 when 81 vessels were released from storage use and reentered the trading fleet, will increase vessel supply. If supply exceeds demand as it has for the past three years, the charter rates for the Company&#8217;s vessels could continue to be depressed to levels well below historical averages, which rates would if maintained over a long period of time have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s revenues and profitability and the value of its vessels.
OSG&#8217;s revenues are subject to seasonal variations 
OSG operates its tankers in markets that have historically exhibited seasonal variations in demand for tanker capacity, and therefore, charter rates. Charter rates for tankers are typically higher in the fall and winter months as a result of increased oil consumption in the Northern Hemisphere. Because a majority of the Company&#8217;s vessels trade in the spot market, seasonality has affected OSG&#8217;s operating results on a quarter-to-quarter basis and could continue to do so in the future. Such seasonality may be outweighed in any period by then current economic conditions or tanker industry fundamentals.
Constraints on capital availability adversely affect the tanker industry and OSG&#8217;s business 
Constraints on capital that have occurred during recent years have adversely affected the financial condition of companies around the world, including certain of the Company&#8217;s customers, joint venture partners, financial lenders and suppliers, including shipyards from whom the Company has contracted to purchase vessels. Those entities that suffer a material adverse impact on their financial condition may be unable or unwilling to comply with their contractual commitments to OSG, or to enter into new commitments, which, in turn, could have an adverse impact on OSG. The failure of entities to comply with, or enter into new, contractual commitments could include the refusal or inability of customers to pay charter hire to OSG, shipyards&#8217; failure to construct and deliver to OSG newbuilds or joint ventures&#8217; or financial lenders&#8217; inability or unwillingness to honor their commitments, or enter into new or additional commitments, such as to contribute funds to a joint venture with OSG or to lend funds to OSG. While OSG seeks to monitor the financial condition of such entities, the availability and accuracy of information about the financial condition of such entities may be limited and the actions that OSG may take to reduce possible losses resulting from the failure of such entities to comply with their contractual obligations may be restricted. See also under the heading &#8220;Company specific risk factors&#8221; below the risk factor concerning credit risks with counterparties.
Terrorist attacks, piracy and international hostilities and instability can affect the tanker industry, which could adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business 
Additional terrorist attacks like those in New York on September 11, 2001 and in London on July 7, 2005, piracy attacks against merchant ships, including oil tankers, particularly in the Gulf of Aden, off the East Coast of Africa, especially Somalia, and the South China sea, the outbreak of war, or the existence of international hostilities could all damage the world economy, adversely affect the availability of and demand for crude oil and petroleum products and adversely affect the Company&#8217;s ability to re-charter its vessels on the expiration or termination of the charters and the charter rates payable under any renewal or replacement charters.
The Company conducts its operations internationally, and its business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by changing economic, political and government conditions in the countries and regions where its vessels are employed, including
Moreover, OSG operates in a sector of the economy that is likely to be adversely impacted by the effects of political instability, terrorist or other attacks, war, international hostilities or piracy. These factors could also increase the costs to OSG of conducting its business, particularly crew, insurance and security costs, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s profitability.
The market value of vessels fluctuates significantly, which could adversely affect OSG&#8217;s liquidity, result in breaches of its financing agreements or otherwise adversely affect its financial condition 
The market value of vessels has fluctuated over time. The fluctuation in market value of vessels over time is based upon various factors, including:
Vessel values have declined in the past three years. Although OSG has a modern fleet, as vessels grow older, they generally decline in value. These factors will affect the value of the Company&#8217;s vessels at the time of any vessel sale. If for any reason, OSG sells a vessel at a time when prices have fallen, the sale may be at less than the vessel&#8217;s carrying amount on its financial statements, with the result that the Company would incur a loss on the sale and a reduction in earnings and surplus. In addition, declining values of the Company&#8217;s vessels could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s liquidity by limiting its ability to raise cash by selling vessels at attractive prices or by refinancing vessels at acceptable levels. Declining vessel values could also result in a breach of certain loan covenants or trigger events of default under relevant financing agreements that require the Company to maintain certain loan-to-value ratios. In such instances, if OSG is unable or unwilling to pledge additional collateral to offset the decline in vessel values, its lenders could accelerate its debt and foreclose on its vessels pledged as collateral for the loans.
Shipping is a business with inherent risks, and OSG&#8217;s insurance may not be adequate to cover its losses 
OSG&#8217;s vessels and their cargoes are at risk of being damaged or lost because of events such as:
In addition, transporting crude oil creates a risk of business interruptions due to political circumstances in foreign countries, hostilities, labor strikes, port closings and boycotts. Any of these events may result in loss of revenues and increased costs.
The Company carries insurance to protect against most of the accident-related risks involved in the conduct of its business. OSG currently maintains one billion dollars in coverage for each of its vessels for liability for spillage or leakage of oil or pollution. OSG also carries insurance covering lost revenue resulting from vessel off-hire due to vessel damage. Nonetheless, risks may arise against which the Company is not adequately insured. For example, a catastrophic spill could exceed OSG&#8217;s insurance coverage and have a material adverse effect on its operations. In addition, OSG may not be able to procure adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates in the future, and OSG cannot guarantee that any particular claim will be paid. In the past, new and stricter environmental regulations have led to higher costs for insurance covering environmental damage or pollution, and new regulations could lead to similar increases or even make this type of insurance unavailable. Furthermore, even if insurance coverage is adequate to cover the Company&#8217;s losses, OSG may not be able to timely obtain a replacement ship in the event of a loss. OSG may also be subject to calls, or premiums, in amounts based not only on its own claim records but also the claim records of all other members of the P &#38; I Associations through which OSG obtains insurance coverage for tort liability. OSG&#8217;s payment of these calls could result in significant expenses which would reduce its profits or cause losses.
Compliance with environmental laws or regulations, including those relating to the emission of greenhouse gases, may adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business 
The Company&#8217;s operations are affected by extensive and changing international, national and local environmental protection laws, regulations, treaties, conventions and standards in force in international waters, the jurisdictional waters of the countries in which OSG&#8217;s vessels operate, as well as the countries of its vessels&#8217; registration. Many of these requirements are designed to reduce the risk of oil spills and other pollution and to decrease emission of greenhouse gases, and OSG&#8217;s compliance with these requirements can be costly.
These requirements can affect the resale value or useful lives of the Company&#8217;s vessels, require a reduction in carrying capacity, ship modifications or operational changes or restrictions, lead to decreased availability or higher cost of insurance coverage for environmental matters or result in the denial of access to certain jurisdictional waters or ports, or detention in, certain ports. Under local, national and foreign laws, as well as international treaties and conventions, OSG could incur material liabilities, including cleanup obligations, in the event that there is a release of petroleum or other hazardous substances from its vessels or otherwise in connection with its operations. OSG could also become subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to the release of or exposure to hazardous materials associated with its current or historic operations. Violations of or liabilities under environmental requirements also can result in substantial penalties, fines and other sanctions, including in certain instances, seizure or detention of the Company&#8217;s vessels.
OSG could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs, fines, penalties, third-party claims and natural resource damages, as the result of an oil spill or other liabilities under environmental laws. The Company is subject to the oversight of several government agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Maritime Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation. OPA 90 affects all vessel owners shipping oil or hazardous material to, from or within the United States. OPA 90 allows for potentially unlimited liability without regard to fault for owners, operators and bareboat charterers of vessels for oil pollution in U.S. waters. Similarly, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, as amended, which has been adopted by most countries outside of the United States, imposes liability for oil pollution in international waters. OPA 90 expressly permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to hazardous materials and oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries. Coastal states in the United States have enacted pollution prevention liability and response laws, many providing for unlimited liability.
In addition, in complying with OPA, IMO regulations, EU directives and other existing laws and regulations and those that may be adopted, shipowners may incur significant additional costs in meeting new maintenance and inspection requirements, in developing contingency arrangements for potential spills and in obtaining insurance coverage. Government regulation of vessels, particularly in the areas of safety and environmental requirements, can be expected to become more strict in the future and require the Company to incur significant capital expenditures on its vessels to keep them in compliance, or even to scrap or sell certain vessels altogether.
In recent years, the IMO and EU have both accelerated their existing non double hull phase out schedules in response to highly publicized oil spills and other shipping incidents involving companies unrelated to OSG. Future accidents can be expected in the industry, and such accidents or other events could be expected to result in the adoption of even stricter laws and regulations, which could limit the Company&#8217;s operations or its ability to do business and which could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business and financial results.
Due to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries, including the U.S., and international organizations, including the EU, the IMO and the United Nations, have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These regulatory measures include, among others, adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. Such actions could result in significant financial and operational impacts on the Company&#8217;s business, including requiring OSG to install new emission controls, acquire allowances or pay taxes related to its greenhouse gas emissions, or administer and manage a greenhouse gas emission program. See the discussion of &#8220;Environmental and Security Matters Relating to Bulk Shipping&#8221; above.
Company specific risk factors: 
The Company&#8217;s business would be adversely affected if it failed to comply with the Jones Act provisions on coastwise trade, or if these provisions were repealed and if changes in international trade agreements were to occur. 
The Company is subject to the Jones Act and other federal laws that restrict maritime transportation between points in the U.S. (known as marine cabotage services or coastwise trade) to vessels built and registered in the U.S. and owned and manned by U.S. citizens. The Company is responsible for monitoring the foreign ownership of its common stock and other interests to insure compliance with the Jones Act. If the Company does not comply with these restrictions, it would be prohibited from operating its vessels in U.S. coastwise trade, and under certain circumstances would be deemed to have undertaken an unapproved foreign transfer, resulting in severe penalties, including permanent loss of U.S. coastwise trading rights for the Company&#8217;s vessels, fines or forfeiture of the vessels.
In order to ensure compliance with Jones Act citizenship requirements, and in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a requirement in July 1976 that at least 77% (the &#8220;Minimum Percentage&#8221;) of the Company&#8217;s common stock must be held by U.S. citizens. While the percentage of U.S. citizenship ownership of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common stock fluctuates daily, at times in the past several years it has declined to the Minimum Percentage. Any purported transfer of common stock in violation of these ownership provisions will be ineffective to transfer the shares of common stock or any voting, dividend or other rights associated with them. The existence and enforcement of this U.S. citizen ownership requirement could have an adverse impact on the liquidity or market value of our common stock in the event that U.S. citizens were unable to transfer shares of our common stock to non-U.S. citizens. Furthermore, under certain circumstances this ownership requirement could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company.
Additionally, the Jones Act restrictions on the provision of maritime cabotage services are subject to exceptions under certain international trade agreements, including the General Agreement on Trade in Services and the North American Free Trade Agreement. If maritime cabotage services were included in the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the North American Free Trade Agreement or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise repealed or altered, the transportation of maritime cargo between U.S. ports could be opened to international flag or international-manufactured vessels. During the past several years, interest groups have lobbied Congress to repeal the Jones Act to facilitate international flag competition for trades and cargoes currently reserved for U.S. Flag vessels under the Jones Act and cargo preference laws. The Company believes that continued efforts will be made to modify or repeal the Jones Act and cargo preference laws currently benefiting U.S. Flag vessels. Because international vessels may have lower construction costs, wage rates and operating costs, this could significantly increase competition in the coastwise trade, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition.
OSG&#8217;s financial condition would be materially adversely affected if the shipping income of OSG&#8217;s foreign subsidiaries becomes subject to current taxation in the U.S. 
As a result of changes made by the 2004 Act, the Company does not include in its U.S tax return on a current basis the unrepatriated shipping income earned by its international flag vessels, which in recent years represented substantially all of the Company&#8217;s pre-tax income. These changes in the 2004 Act were made to make U.S. controlled shipping companies competitive with foreign-controlled shipping companies, which are generally incorporated in jurisdictions in which they either do not pay income taxes or pay minimal income taxes.
The President and several Congressmen and Senators have announced support for ending &#8220;tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas and give those tax breaks for companies that create jobs in the United States of America&#8221;. While the Company believes that the changes made in the 2004 Act with respect to foreign shipping income do not &#8220;ship jobs overseas,&#8221; and, in fact, have enabled the Company to expand its U.S. Flag fleet and create jobs in the U.S., Congress may decide to repeal the changes made in the 2004 Act with respect to taxation of foreign shipping income for the aforementioned reason or as part of initiatives to reduce the U.S. budget deficit or to reform the U.S. corporate tax regime. Such repeal, either directly or indirectly by limiting or reducing benefits received under the 2004 Act, would have a materially adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business and financial results.
The Company&#8217;s substantial debt and charter in commitments could adversely affect its financial condition and ability to incur additional debt 
OSG has substantial debt and debt service requirements and charter-in commitments. At December 31, 2011, the Company&#8217;s consolidated total debt was approximately $2.1 billion and its unused borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility was approximately $700 million (before a reduction of $150 million effective February 2012) and its charter in commitments were approximately $1.3 billion.
The amount of the Company&#8217;s debt and charter-in obligations could have important consequences. For example, it could:
Furthermore, the Company may begin borrowing in February 2013 under a $900 million unsecured forward start revolving credit facility (the &#8220;Forward Start Facility&#8221;) entered into in May 2011, which is at the same time the Company&#8217;s existing unsecured revolving credit facility expires (the &#8220;Existing Facility&#8221;). The amount currently outstanding under the Existing Facility approximately equals the capacity under the Forward Start Facility so that the Company could have no unused borrowing capacity under the Forward Start Facility. While the amount of the Forward Start Facility may be increased to up to $1.25 billion if the bank lending group agrees to such increase, no assurance can be given that the lending group will agree or that OSG will be able to borrow additional funds.
In January 2012, Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s credit agency reduced the Company&#8217;s long-term corporate credit rating from B to B-, with a negative outlook, citing, among other reasons, a steep deterioration in the Company&#8217;s financial profile because of prolonged low tanker rates, rising operating losses and the Company&#8217;s high debt burden. Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s stated that in its assessment the Company has less than adequate liquidity.
The reduced credit rating together with the Company&#8217;s debt burden and low tanker rates may adversely affect the availability and terms of debt and equity capital. While the Company monitors compliance with its financing agreements, continued low tanker rates and operating losses may result in the Company violating its financial covenants which could result in the adoption of loan terms less favorable to the Company than existing terms or an acceleration of the Company&#8217;s indebtedness. If the maturity of the Company&#8217;s indebtedness is accelerated, the Company may not be able to refinance the indebtedness on favorable terms or at all, which would materially adversely affect the Company.
OSG may not be able to renew time charters when they expire or enter into new time charters 
There can be no assurance that any of the Company&#8217;s existing time charters will be renewed at comparable rates or if renewed, that they will be at favorable rates. If, upon expiration of the existing time charters, OSG is unable to obtain time charters or voyage charters at desirable rates, the Company&#8217;s profitability may be adversely affected.
Delays or cost overruns in building new vessels (including the failure to deliver new vessels), in the scheduled shipyard maintenance of the Company&#8217;s vessels, or conversion of the Company&#8217;s vessels could adversely affect OSG&#8217;s results of operations 
Building new vessels, scheduled shipyard maintenance or conversion of vessels are subject to risks of delay (including the failure to deliver new vessels) or cost overruns caused by one or more of the following:
Significant delays, cost overruns and failure to deliver new vessels could increase the Company&#8217;s expected contract commitments, which would have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s revenues, borrowing capacity and results of operations. Furthermore, delays would result in vessels being out of service for extended periods of time, and therefore not earning revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations. The Company&#8217;s remedies for losses resulting from shipyards&#8217; failure to comply with their contractual commitments may be limited by the relevant contracts, including by liquidated damages provisions, such as those that limit the amount of monetary damages that may be claimed or that limit the Company&#8217;s right to cancellation of the building contract. While purchase price payments for newbuild vessels made prior to vessel delivery to international shipyards historically have been supported by guarantees from financial institutions, such as banks or insurance companies, such payments to U.S. shipyards historically have been supported by liens on the work in progress, including steel and equipment used for constructing the vessel, and not by guarantees from financial institutions. If an international shipyard fails to deliver a contracted newbuild vessel for which there is a guarantee, the Company may claim against the guarantee, substantially reducing the risk that the Company will suffer a loss of its investment. If a U.S. shipyard fails to deliver a contracted vessel, the Company&#8217;s investment may be supported only by the Company&#8217;s liens on the work in progress, which may result in a loss of part or all of the Company&#8217;s investment.
Termination or change in the nature of OSG&#8217;s relationship with any of the pools in which it participates could adversely affect its business 
All of the Company&#8217;s VLCCs participate in the Tankers International pool. At December 31, 2011, nine of OSG&#8217;s Aframaxes participate in the Aframax International pool. Nine of its crude Panamaxes and four of its Panamax Product Carriers participate directly in Panamax International. Participation in these pools enhances the financial performance of the Company&#8217;s vessels as a result of the higher vessel utilization. Any participant in any of these pools has the right to withdraw upon notice in accordance with the relevant pool agreement. The Company cannot predict whether the pools in which its vessels operate will continue to exist in the future. In addition, in recent years the EU has published guidelines on the application of the EU antitrust rules to traditional agreements for maritime services such as pools. While the Company believes that all the pools it participates in comply with EU rules, there has been limited administrative and judicial interpretation of the rules. Restrictive interpretations of the guidelines could adversely affect the ability to commercially market the respective types of vessels in pools.
OSG&#8217;s strategy of growing its business in part through acquisitions is capital intensive, time consuming and subject to a number of inherent risks 
Part of OSG&#8217;s business strategy is to opportunistically acquire complementary businesses or vessels. The Company&#8217;s ability to grow its fleets will depend upon a number of factors, many of which the Company cannot control. These factors include OSG&#8217;s ability to:
OSG&#8217;s strategy includes the opportunistic acquisition of quality second hand vessels either directly or through corporate acquisitions. Second hand vessels typically do not carry warranties with respect to their condition, whereas warranties are generally available for newbuildings. While the Company generally inspects all second hand vessels prior to purchase, such inspections would normally not provide OSG with as much knowledge about vessel condition as the Company would possess if the vessels had been built for it.
Operating costs and capital expenses will increase as the Company&#8217;s vessels age 
In general, capital expenditures and other costs necessary for maintaining a vessel in good operating condition increase as the age of the vessel increases. Accordingly, it is likely that the operating costs of OSG&#8217;s vessels will increase. In addition, changes in governmental regulations and compliance with Classification Society standards may require OSG to make additional expenditures for new equipment. In order to add such equipment, OSG may be required to take its vessels out of service. There can be no assurance that market conditions will justify such expenditures or enable OSG to operate its older vessels profitably during the remainder of their economic lives.
Certain potential customers will not use vessels older than a specified age, even if they have been recently rebuilt 
All of the Company&#8217;s existing ATBs with the exception of the OSG Vision/OSG 350 and the OSG Horizon/OSG 351were originally constructed more than 25 years ago. While all of these tug-barge units were rebuilt and double-hulled since 1998 and are &#8220;in-class,&#8221; meaning the vessel has been certified by a classification society as being built and maintained in accordance with the rules of that classification society and complies with the applicable rules and regulations of the vessel&#8217;s country of registry and applicable international conventions, some potential customers have stated that they will not charter vessels that are more than 20 years old, even if they have been rebuilt. No assurance can be given that customers will continue to view rebuilt vessels as comparable to newbuild vessels. If more customers differentiate between rebuilt and newbuild vessels, time charter rates for our rebuilt ATBs will likely be adversely affected or they may not be employable.
In the highly competitive international market, OSG may not be able to effectively compete for charters with companies with greater resources 
The Company&#8217;s vessels are employed in a highly competitive market. Competition arises from other vessel owners, including major oil companies, which may have substantially greater resources than OSG does. Competition for the transportation of crude oil and other petroleum products depends on price, location, size, age, condition, and the acceptability of the vessel operator to the charterer. The Company believes that because ownership of the world tanker fleet is highly fragmented, no single vessel owner is able to influence charter rates. To the extent OSG enters into new geographic regions or provides new services, it may not be able to compete profitably. New markets may involve competitive factors that differ from those of the Company&#8217;s current markets, and the competitors in those markets may have greater financial strength and capital resources than OSG does.
Trading and complementary hedging activities in Forward Freight Agreements (&#8220;FFAs&#8221;) subject the Company to trading risks and the Company may suffer trading losses that reduce earnings 
Due to shipping market volatility, success in this industry requires constant adjustment of the balance between chartering out vessels for long periods of time and trading them on a spot basis. The Company from time to time seeks to manage and mitigate that risk through trading and complementary hedging activities in forward freight agreements, or FFAs. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be able at all times to successfully protect itself from volatility in the shipping market. The Company may not successfully mitigate its risks, leaving it exposed to unprofitable contracts and may suffer trading losses that reduce earnings and surplus.
The Company is subject to credit risks with respect to its counterparties on contracts and failure of such counterparties to meet their obligations could cause the Company to suffer losses on such contracts, decreasing revenues and earnings 
The Company charters its vessels to other parties, who pay the Company a daily rate of hire. The Company also enters into COAs and Voyage Charters. As OSG increases the portion of its revenues from time charters, it increases its reliance on the ability of time charterers to pay charter hire, especially when spot market rates are less than previously agreed upon time charter rates. Historically, the Company has not experienced material problems collecting charter hire but the global economic downturn of recent years has affected charterers more severely than the prior recessions that have occurred since the Company&#8217;s establishment more than 40 years ago. The Company also time charters or bareboat charters some of its vessels from other parties and its continued use and operation of such vessels depends on the vessel owners&#8217; compliance with the terms of the time charter or bareboat charter. Additionally, the Company enters into derivative contracts (FFAs, bunker swaps, interest rate swaps and foreign currency contracts). All of these contracts subject the Company to counterparty credit risk. As a result, the Company is subject to credit risks at various levels, including with charterers or cargo interests. If the counterparties fail to meet their obligations, the Company could suffer losses on such contracts which would decrease revenues and earnings.
OSG depends on its key personnel and may have difficulty attracting and retaining skilled employees 
OSG&#8217;s success depends to a significant extent upon the abilities and efforts of its key personnel. The loss of the services of any of the Company&#8217;s key personnel or its inability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition and operating results.
The Company may face unexpected drydock costs for its vessels 
Vessels must be drydocked periodically. The cost of repairs and renewals required at each drydock are difficult to predict with certainty and can be substantial. The Company&#8217;s insurance does not cover these costs. In addition, vessels may have to be drydocked in the event of accidents or other unforeseen damage. OSG&#8217;s insurance may not cover all of these costs. Large drydocking expenses could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s financial results.
Maritime claimants could arrest OSG&#8217;s vessels, which could interrupt its cash flow 
Crew members, suppliers of goods and services to a vessel, shippers of cargo and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against that vessel for unsatisfied debts, claims or damages. In many jurisdictions, a maritime lien holder may enforce its lien by arresting a vessel through foreclosure proceedings. The arrest or attachment of one or more of the Company&#8217;s vessels could interrupt OSG&#8217;s cash flow, damage OSG&#8217;s reputation and require it to pay a significant amount of money to have the arrest lifted. In addition, in some jurisdictions, such as South Africa, under the &#8220;sister ship&#8221; theory of liability, a claimant may arrest both the vessel that is subject to the claimant&#8217;s maritime lien and any &#8220;associated&#8221; vessel, which is any vessel owned or controlled by the same owner. Claimants could try to assert &#8220;sister ship&#8221; liability against one vessel in the Company&#8217;s fleet for claims relating to another vessel in its fleet. Vessels chartered in by the Company may be arrested or attached for debts of, or claims or damages against, the vessel&#8217;s owners, interrupting OSG&#8217;s use of the vessel and exposing OSG to claims from OSG&#8217;s customers.

OSG,OVERSEAS SHIPHOLDING GROUP INC,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/75208/000114420411011868/0001144204-11-011868.txt,2011-03-01T13:15:45-05:00," ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
The following important risk factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements made in this report or presented elsewhere by management from time to time. If any of the circumstances or events described below actually arise or occur, the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 
Industry specific risk factors: 
The highly cyclical nature of the industry may lead to volatile changes in charter rates and vessel values, which may adversely affect the Company&#8217;s earnings 
Factors affecting the supply and demand for vessels are outside of the Company&#8217;s control, and the nature, timing and degree of changes in industry conditions are unpredictable and may adversely affect the values of the Company&#8217;s vessels and result in significant fluctuations in the amount of charter hire the Company may earn, which could result in significant fluctuations in OSG&#8217;s quarterly results. The factors that influence the demand for tanker capacity include: 
demand for oil and oil products, which affect the need for vessel capacity; 
global and regional economic and political conditions which among other things, could impact the supply of oil as well as trading patterns and the demand for various types of vessels; 
changes in the production of crude oil, particularly by OPEC and other key producers, which impact the need for vessel capacity; 
developments in international trade; 
changes in seaborne and other transportation patterns, including changes in the distances that cargoes are transported; 
environmental concerns and regulations; 
new pipeline construction and expansions; 
weather; and 
competition from alternative sources of energy. 
The factors that influence the supply of vessel capacity include: 
the number of newbuilding deliveries; 
the scrapping rate of older vessels; 
the number of vessels that are used for storage or as floating storage offloading service vessels; 
the conversion of vessels from transporting oil and oil products to carrying dry bulk cargo and the reverse conversion; 
the number of vessels that are out of service; and 
environmental and maritime regulations. 
An increase in the supply of vessels without a commensurate increase in demand for such vessels could cause charter rates to remain at depressed levels or to further decline, which could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s revenues and profitability 
OSG depends on spot charters for a significant portion of its revenues. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, OSG derived approximately 64%, 49% and 65%, respectively, of its TCE revenues in the spot market. 
Historically, the marine transportation industry has been cyclical. The profitability and asset values of companies in the industry have fluctuated based on changes in the supply and demand of vessels. The supply of vessels generally increases with deliveries of new vessels and decreases with the scrapping of older vessels. The newbuilding order book equaled 28% of the existing world tanker fleet as of December 31, 2010, a significant percentage but a decrease from 31% as of December 31, 2009. 
If the number of new ships delivered exceeds the number of vessels being scrapped, capacity will increase. In addition, vessel supply is affected by the number of vessels that are used for floating storage because vessels that are used for storage are not available to transport crude oil and petroleum products. Utilization of vessels for storage is affected by expectations of changes in the price of oil and products, such utilization generally increasing if prices are expected to increase more than storage costs and generally decreasing if they are not. A reduction in vessel utilization for storage, which occurred in 2010 when 81 vessels were released from storage use and reentered the trading fleet, will increase vessel supply. If supply exceeds demand as it did in 2009 and 2010, the charter rates for the Company&#8217;s vessels could be depressed to levels well below historical averages, which rates would if maintained over a long period of time have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s revenues and profitability. 
Although charter rates increased in 2010 they remained significantly below 2008 levels for all tanker classes operated by OSG. 
OSG&#8217;s revenues are subject to seasonal variations 
OSG operates its tankers in markets that have historically exhibited seasonal variations in demand for tanker capacity, and therefore, charter rates. Charter rates for tankers are typically higher in the fall and winter months as a result of increased oil consumption in the Northern Hemisphere. Because a majority of the Company&#8217;s vessels trade in the spot market, seasonality has affected OSG&#8217;s operating results on a quarter-to-quarter basis and could continue to do so in the future. Such seasonality may be outweighed in any period by then current economic conditions or tanker industry fundamentals. 
Constraints on capital availability adversely affect the tanker industry and OSG&#8217;s business 
Constraints on capital that have occurred during recent years have adversely affected the financial condition of entities throughout the world, including certain of the Company&#8217;s customers, joint venture partners, financial lenders and suppliers, including shipyards from whom the Company has contracted to purchase vessels. Those entities that suffer a material adverse impact on their financial condition may be unable or unwilling to comply with their contractual commitments to OSG which, in turn, could have an adverse impact on OSG. The failure of entities to comply with contractual commitments could include the refusal or inability of customers to pay charter hire to OSG, shipyards&#8217; failure to construct and deliver to OSG newbuilds or joint ventures&#8217; or financial lenders&#8217; inability or unwillingness to honor their commitments, such as to contribute funds to a joint venture with OSG or to lend funds to OSG. While OSG seeks to monitor the financial condition of such entities, the availability and accuracy of information about the financial condition of such entities may be limited and the actions that OSG may take to reduce possible losses resulting from the failure of such entities to comply with their contractual obligations may be restricted. See also under the heading &#8220;Company specific risk factors&#8221; below the risk factor concerning credit risks with counterparties. 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
Terrorist attacks, piracy and international hostilities and instability can affect the tanker industry, which could adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business 
Additional terrorist attacks like those in New York on September 11, 2001 and in London on July 7, 2005, piracy attacks against merchant ships, including oil tankers, particularly in the Gulf of Aden, off the East Coast of Africa, especially Somalia, and the South China sea, the outbreak of war, or the existence of international hostilities could all damage the world economy, adversely affect the availability of and demand for crude oil and petroleum products and adversely affect the Company&#8217;s ability to re-charter its vessels on the expiration or termination of the charters and the charter rates payable under any renewal or replacement charters. 
The Company conducts its operations internationally, and its business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by changing economic, political and government conditions in the countries and regions where its vessels are employed, including 
pandemics or epidemics which may result in a disruption of worldwide trade including quarantines of certain areas; 
currency fluctuations; 
the imposition of taxes by flag states, port states and jurisdictions in which OSG or its subsidiaries are incorporated or where its vessels operate; and 
expropriation of its vessels. 
Moreover, OSG operates in a sector of the economy that is likely to be adversely impacted by the effects of political instability, terrorist or other attacks, war, international hostilities or piracy. These factors could also increase the costs to OSG of conducting its business, particularly crew, insurance and security costs, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s profitability. 
The market value of vessels fluctuates significantly, which could adversely affect OSG&#8217;s liquidity, result in breaches of its financing agreements or otherwise adversely affect its financial condition 
The market value of vessels has fluctuated over time. The fluctuation in market value of vessels over time is based upon various factors, including: 
age of the vessel; 
general economic and market conditions affecting the tanker industry, including the availability of vessel financing; 
number of vessels in the world fleet; 
types and sizes of vessels available; 
changes in trading patterns affecting demand for particular sizes and types of vessels; 
cost of newbuildings; 
prevailing level of charter rates; 
competition from other shipping companies; 
other modes of transportation; and 
technological advances in vessel design and propulsion. 
Vessel values have declined in the past two years. Although OSG has a modern fleet, as vessels grow older, they generally decline in value. These factors will affect the value of the Company&#8217;s vessels at the time of any vessel sale. If for any reason, OSG sells a vessel at a time when prices have fallen, the sale may be at less than the vessel&#8217;s carrying amount on its financial statements, with the result that the Company would incur a loss on the sale and a reduction in earnings and surplus. In addition, declining values of the Company&#8217;s vessels could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s liquidity by limiting its ability to raise cash by refinancing vessels. Declining vessel values could also result in a breach of loan covenants or trigger events of default under relevant financing agreements that require the Company to maintain certain loan-to-value ratios. In such instances, if OSG is unable or unwilling to pledge additional collateral to offset the decline in vessel values, its lenders could accelerate its debt and foreclose on its vessels pledged as collateral for the loans. 
Shipping is a business with inherent risks, and OSG&#8217;s insurance may not be adequate to cover its losses 
OSG&#8217;s vessels and their cargoes are at risk of being damaged or lost because of events such as: 
marine disasters; 
bad weather; 
mechanical failures; 
human error; 
war, terrorism and piracy; and 
other unforeseen circumstances or events. 
In addition, transporting crude oil creates a risk of business interruptions due to political circumstances in foreign countries, hostilities, labor strikes, port closings and boycotts. Any of these events may result in loss of revenues and increased costs. 
The Company carries insurance to protect against most of the accident-related risks involved in the conduct of its business. OSG currently maintains one billion dollars in coverage for each of its vessels for liability for spillage or leakage of oil or pollution. OSG also carries insurance covering lost revenue resulting from vessel off-hire due to vessel damage. Nonetheless, risks may arise against which the Company is not adequately insured. For example, a catastrophic spill could exceed OSG&#8217;s insurance coverage and have a material adverse effect on its operations. In addition, OSG may not be able to procure adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates in the future, and OSG cannot guarantee that any particular claim will be paid. In the past, new and stricter environmental regulations have led to higher costs for insurance covering environmental damage or pollution, and new regulations could lead to similar increases or even make this type of insurance unavailable. Furthermore, even if insurance coverage is adequate to cover the Company&#8217;s losses, OSG may not be able to timely obtain a replacement ship in the event of a loss. OSG may also be subject to calls, or premiums, in amounts based not only on its own claim records but also the claim records of all other members of the P &#38; I Associations through which OSG obtains insurance coverage for tort liability. OSG&#8217;s payment of these calls could result in significant expenses which would reduce its profits or cause losses. 
Compliance with environmental laws or regulations , including those relating to the emission of greenhouse gases, may adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business 
The Company&#8217;s operations are affected by extensive and changing international, national and local environmental protection laws, regulations, treaties, conventions and standards in force in international waters, the jurisdictional waters of the countries in which OSG&#8217;s vessels operate, as well as the countries of its vessels&#8217; registration. Many of these requirements are designed to reduce the risk of oil spills and other pollution and to decrease emission of greenhouse gases, and OSG&#8217;s compliance with these requirements can be costly. 
These requirements can affect the resale value or useful lives of the Company&#8217;s vessels, require a reduction in carrying capacity, ship modifications or operational changes or restrictions, lead to decreased availability or higher cost of insurance coverage for environmental matters or result in the denial of access to certain jurisdictional waters or ports, or detention in, certain ports. Under local, national and foreign laws, as well as international treaties and conventions, OSG could incur material liabilities, including cleanup obligations, in the event that there is a release of petroleum or other hazardous substances from its vessels or otherwise in connection with its operations. OSG could also become subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to the release of or exposure to hazardous materials associated with its current or historic operations. Violations of or liabilities under environmental requirements also can result in substantial penalties, fines and other sanctions, including in certain instances, seizure or detention of the Company&#8217;s vessels. 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
OSG could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs, fines, penalties, third-party claims and natural resource damages, as the result of an oil spill or other liabilities under environmental laws. The Company is subject to the oversight of several government agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Maritime Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation. OPA 90 affects all vessel owners shipping oil or hazardous material to, from or within the United States. OPA 90 allows for potentially unlimited liability without regard to fault for owners, operators and bareboat charterers of vessels for oil pollution in U.S. waters. Similarly, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, as amended, which has been adopted by most countries outside of the United States, imposes liability for oil pollution in international waters. OPA 90 expressly permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to hazardous materials and oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries. Coastal states in the United States have enacted pollution prevention liability and response laws, many providing for unlimited liability. 
In addition, in complying with OPA, IMO regulations, EU directives and other existing laws and regulations and those that may be adopted, shipowners may incur significant additional costs in meeting new maintenance and inspection requirements, in developing contingency arrangements for potential spills and in obtaining insurance coverage. Government regulation of vessels, particularly in the areas of safety and environmental requirements, can be expected to become more strict in the future and require the Company to incur significant capital expenditures on its vessels to keep them in compliance, or even to scrap or sell certain vessels altogether. 
In recent years, the IMO and EU have both accelerated their existing non double hull phase out schedules in response to highly publicized oil spills and other shipping incidents involving companies unrelated to OSG. Future accidents can be expected in the industry, and such accidents or other events could be expected to result in the adoption of even stricter laws and regulations, which could limit the Company&#8217;s operations or its ability to do business and which could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business and financial results. 
Due to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries, including the U.S., and international organizations, including the EU, the IMO and the United Nations, have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These regulatory measures include, among others, adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. Such actions could result in significant financial and operational impacts on the Company&#8217;s business, including requiring OSG to install new emission controls, acquire allowances or pay taxes related to its greenhouse gas emissions, or administer and manage a greenhouse gas emission program. See the discussion of &#8220;Environmental and Security Matters Relating to Bulk Shipping&#8221; above. 
Company specific risk factors: 
The Company&#8217;s business would be adversely affected if it failed to comply with the Jones Act provisions on coastwise trade, or if these provisions were repealed and if changes in international trade agreements were to occur. 
The Company is subject to the Jones Act and other federal laws that restrict maritime transportation between points in the U.S. (known as marine cabotage services or coastwise trade) to vessels built and registered in the U.S. and owned and manned by U.S. citizens. The Company is responsible for monitoring the foreign ownership of its common stock and other interests to insure compliance with the Jones Act. If the Company does not comply with these restrictions, it would be prohibited from operating its vessels in U.S. coastwise trade, and under certain circumstances would be deemed to have undertaken an unapproved foreign transfer, resulting in severe penalties, including permanent loss of U.S. coastwise trading rights for the Company&#8217;s vessels, fines or forfeiture of the vessels. 
In order to ensure compliance with Jones Act citizenship requirements, and in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a requirement in July 1976 that at least 77% (the &#8220;Minimum Percentage&#8221;) of the Company&#8217;s common stock must be held by U.S. citizens. While the percentage of U.S. citizenship ownership of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common stock fluctuates daily, at times in the past several years it has declined to the Minimum Percentage. Any purported transfer of common stock in violation of these ownership provisions will be ineffective to transfer the shares of common stock or any voting, dividend or other rights associated with them. The existence and enforcement of this U.S. citizen ownership requirement could have an adverse impact on the liquidity or market value of our common stock in the event that U.S. citizens were unable to transfer shares of our common stock to non-U.S. citizens. Furthermore, under certain circumstances this ownership requirement could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company. 
Additionally, the Jones Act restrictions on the provision of maritime cabotage services are subject to exceptions under certain international trade agreements, including the General Agreement on Trade in Services and the North American Free Trade Agreement. If maritime cabotage services were included in the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the North American Free Trade Agreement or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise repealed or altered, the transportation of maritime cargo between U.S. ports could be opened to international flag or international-manufactured vessels. During the past several years, interest groups have lobbied Congress to repeal the Jones Act to facilitate international flag competition for trades and cargoes currently reserved for U.S. Flag vessels under the Jones Act and cargo preference laws. The Company believes that continued efforts will be made to modify or repeal the Jones Act and cargo preference laws currently benefiting U.S. Flag vessels. Because international vessels may have lower construction costs, wage rates and operating costs, this could significantly increase competition in the coastwise trade, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. 
OSG&#8217;s financial condition would be materially adversely affected if the shipping income of OSG&#8217;s foreign subsidiaries becomes subject to current taxation in the U.S. 
As a result of changes made by the 2004 Act, the Company does not report in taxable income on a current basis the undistributed shipping income earned by its international flag vessels, which in recent years represented substantially all of the Company&#8217;s pre-tax income. These changes in the 2004 Act were made to make U.S. controlled shipping companies competitive with foreign-controlled shipping companies, which are generally incorporated in jurisdictions in which they either do not pay income taxes or pay minimal income taxes. 
The President and several Congressmen and Senators have announced support for ending &#8220;tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas and give those tax breaks for companies that create jobs in the United States of America&#8221;. While the Company believes that the changes made in the 2004 Act with respect to foreign shipping income do not &#8220;ship jobs overseas,&#8221; and, in fact, have enabled the Company to expand its U.S. Flag fleet and create jobs in the U.S., Congress may decide to repeal the changes made in the 2004 Act with respect to taxation of foreign shipping income for the aforementioned reason or as part of initiatives to reduce the U.S. budget deficit or to reform the U.S. corporate tax regime. Such repeal, either directly or indirectly by limiting or reducing benefits received under the 2004 Act, would have a materially adverse affect on the Company&#8217;s business and financial results. 
The Company&#8217;s substantial debt and charter in commitments could adversely affect its financial condition and when OSG&#8217;s credit facilities mature, OSG may not be able to refinance or replace them 
OSG has substantial debt and debt service requirements. At December 31, 2010, the Company&#8217;s consolidated total debt was $2.0 billion and its unused borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility was $1.0 billion (before a reduction of $150 million effective February 2011) and its charter in commitments were $1.6 billion. 
The amount of the Company&#8217;s debt could have important consequences. For example, it could: 
increase OSG&#8217;s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; 
limit OSG&#8217;s ability to fund future capital expenditures, working capital and other general corporate requirements; 
require the Company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to make interest and principal payments on its debt; 
limit OSG&#8217;s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the shipping industry; 
place OSG at a competitive disadvantage compared with competitors that have less debt or charter-in commitments including by causing OSG to have a lower credit rating; and 
limit OSG&#8217;s ability to borrow additional funds, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity. 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
In January 2011, Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s credit agency reduced the Company&#8217;s long-term corporate credit rating from BB- to B, citing, among other reasons, the Company&#8217;s high debt burden and the significantly reduced earnings caused by prolonged low tanker rates. While Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s stated that it expects OSG to continue to have sufficient liquidity to work through the weak operating environment and to eventually benefit from a recovery in tanker rates over the next several years, the reduced credit rating may result in the Company incurring increased borrowing costs if the Company enters new credit facilities. 
The Company&#8217;s debt burden and low tanker rates may adversely affect the availability and terms of debt and equity capital. When OSG&#8217;s indebtedness matures, the Company may need to refinance it and may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all. If OSG is able to refinance maturing indebtedness, the terms of any refinancing or alternate credit arrangements may contain terms and covenants that restrict OSG&#8217;s financial and operating flexibility. 
OSG may not be able to renew time charters when they expire or enter into new time charters for newbuilds 
There can be no assurance that any of the Company&#8217;s existing time charters will be renewed at comparable rates or that it will be successful in entering into new time charters on certain of the newbuilds that will be delivered to the Company or if renewed or entered into, that they will be at favorable rates. If, upon expiration of the existing time charters or delivery of newbuilds, OSG is unable to obtain time charters or voyage charters at desirable rates, the Company&#8217;s profitability may be adversely affected. 
Delays or cost overruns in building new vessels (including the failure to deliver new vessels), in the scheduled shipyard maintenance of the Company&#8217;s vessels, or in rebuilding or conversion of the Company&#8217;s vessels could adversely affect OSG&#8217;s results of operations 
Building new vessels, scheduled shipyard maintenance or rebuilding or conversion of vessels are subject to risks of delay (including the failure to deliver new vessels) or cost overruns caused by one or more of the following: 
financial difficulties of the shipyard building or repairing a vessel, including bankruptcy; 
unforeseen quality or engineering problems; 
work stoppages; 
weather interference; 
unanticipated cost increases; 
delays in receipt of necessary materials or equipment; 
changes to design specifications; and 
inability to obtain the requisite permits, approvals or certifications from the U.S. Coast Guard or international foreign flag state authorities and the applicable classification society upon completion of work. 
Significant delays, cost overruns and failure to deliver new vessels could increase the Company&#8217;s expected contract commitments, which would have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s revenues, borrowing capacity and results of operations. Furthermore, delays would result in vessels being out-of-service for extended periods of time, and therefore not earning revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations. The Company&#8217;s remedies for losses resulting from shipyards&#8217; failure to comply with their contractual commitments may be limited by the relevant contracts, including by liquidated damages provisions, such as those that limit the amount of monetary damages that may be claimed or that limit the Company&#8217;s right to cancellation of the building contract. While purchase price payments for newbuild vessels made prior to vessel delivery to international shipyards historically have been supported by guarantees from financial institutions, such as banks or insurance companies, such payments to U.S. shipyards historically have been supported by liens on the work in progress, including steel and equipment used for constructing the vessel, and not by guarantees from financial institutions. If an international shipyard fails to deliver a contracted newbuild vessel for which there is a guarantee, the Company may claim against the guarantee, substantially reducing the risk that the Company will suffer a loss of its investment. If a U.S. shipyard fails to deliver a contracted vessel, the Company&#8217;s investment may be supported only by the Company&#8217;s liens on the work in progress, which may result in a loss of part or all of the Company&#8217;s investment. 
Termination or change in the nature of OSG&#8217;s relationship with any of the pools in which it participates could adversely affect its business 
All of the Company&#8217;s VLCCs participate in the Tankers International pool. At December 31, 2010, eleven of OSG&#8217;s Aframaxes participate in the Aframax International pool. Eight of its crude Panamaxes and three of its Panamax Product Carriers participate directly in Panamax International. Participation in these pools enhances the financial performance of the Company&#8217;s vessels as a result of the higher vessel utilization. Any participant in any of these pools has the right to withdraw upon notice in accordance with the relevant pool agreement. The Company cannot predict whether the pools in which its vessels operate will continue to exist in the future. In addition, in recent years the EU has published guidelines on the application of the EU antitrust rules to traditional agreements for maritime services such as pools. While the Company believes that all the pools it participates in comply with EU rules, there has been limited administrative and judicial interpretation of the rules. Restrictive interpretations of the guidelines could adversely affect the ability to commercially market the respective types of vessels in pools. 
OSG&#8217;s strategy of growing its business in part through acquisitions is capital intensive, time consuming and subject to a number of inherent risks 
Part of OSG&#8217;s business strategy is to opportunistically acquire complementary businesses or vessels. The Company&#8217;s ability to grow its fleets will depend upon a number of factors, many of which the Company cannot control. These factors include OSG&#8217;s ability to: 
identify acquisition candidates and joint venture opportunities; 
replace expiring charters-in at comparable rates; 
identify suitable charter-in opportunities; 
consummate acquisitions or joint ventures; 
integrate any acquired vessels or businesses successfully with its existing operations; 
hire and train qualified personnel; and 
obtain required financing. 
OSG&#8217;s strategy includes the opportunistic acquisition of quality second hand vessels either directly or through corporate acquisitions. Second hand vessels typically do not carry warranties with respect to their condition, whereas warranties are generally available for newbuildings. While the Company generally inspects all second hand vessels prior to purchase, such inspections would normally not provide OSG with as much knowledge about vessel condition as the Company would possess if the vessels had been built for it. 
Operating costs and capital expenses will increase as the Company&#8217;s vessels age 
In general, capital expenditures and other costs necessary for maintaining a vessel in good operating condition increase as the age of the vessel increases. Accordingly, it is likely that the operating costs of OSG&#8217;s vessels will increase. In addition, changes in governmental regulations and compliance with Classification Society standards may require OSG to make additional expenditures for new equipment. In order to add such equipment, OSG may be required to take its vessels out of service. There can be no assurance that market conditions will justify such expenditures or enable OSG to operate its older vessels profitably during the remainder of their economic lives. 
Certain potential customers will not use vessels older than a specified age, even if they have been recently rebuilt 
All of the Company&#8217;s existing ATBs with the exception of the OSG Vision/OSG 350 were originally constructed more than 25 years ago. While all of these tug-barge units were rebuilt and double-hulled since 1998 and are &#8220;in-class,&#8221; meaning the vessel has been certified by a classification society as being built and maintained in accordance with the rules of that classification society and complies with the applicable rules and regulations of the vessel&#8217;s country of registry and applicable international conventions, some potential customers have stated that they will not charter vessels that are more than 20 years old, even if they have been rebuilt. Although there has to date been no material difference in time charter rates earned by a vessel of a specified age and a rebuilt vessel of the same age measured from the date of rebuilding, no assurance can be given that customers will continue to view rebuilt vessels as comparable to newbuild vessels. If more customers differentiate between rebuilt and newbuild vessels, time charter rates for our rebuilt ATBs will likely be adversely affected or they may not be employable. 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
In the highly competitive international market, OSG may not be able to effectively compete for charters with companies with greater resources 
The Company&#8217;s vessels are employed in a highly competitive market. Competition arises from other vessel owners, including major oil companies, which may have substantially greater resources than OSG does. Competition for the transportation of crude oil and other petroleum products depends on price, location, size, age, condition, and the acceptability of the vessel operator to the charterer. The Company believes that because ownership of the world tanker fleet is highly fragmented, no single vessel owner is able to influence charter rates. To the extent OSG enters into new geographic regions or provides new services, it may not be able to compete profitably. New markets may involve competitive factors that differ from those of the Company&#8217;s current markets, and the competitors in those markets may have greater financial strength and capital resources than OSG does. 
Trading and complementary hedging activities in Forward Freight Agreements (&#8220;FFAs&#8221;) subject the Company to trading risks and the Company may suffer trading losses that reduce earnings 
Due to shipping market volatility, success in this industry requires constant adjustment of the balance between chartering out vessels for long periods of time and trading them on a spot basis. The Company seeks to manage and mitigate that risk through trading and complementary hedging activities in forward freight agreements, or FFAs. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be able at all times to successfully protect itself from volatility in the shipping market. The Company may not successfully mitigate its risks, leaving it exposed to unprofitable contracts and may suffer trading losses that reduce earnings and surplus. 
The Company is subject to certain credit risks with respect to its counterparties on contracts and failure of such counterparties to meet their obligations could cause the Company to suffer losses on such contracts, decreasing revenues and earnings 
The Company charters its vessels to other parties, who pay the Company a daily rate of hire. The Company also enters into COAs and Voyage Charters. As OSG increases the portion of its revenues from time charters, it increases its reliance on the ability of time charterers to pay charter hire, especially when spot market rates are less than previously agreed upon time charter rates. Historically, the Company has not experienced material problems collecting charter hire but the global economic downturn of recent years has affected charterers more severely than the prior recessions that have occurred since the Company&#8217;s establishment more than 40 years ago. The Company also time charters or bareboat charters some of its vessels from other parties and its continued use and operation of such vessels depends on the vessel owners&#8217; compliance with the terms of the time charter or bareboat charter. Additionally, the Company enters into derivative contracts (FFAs, bunker swaps, interest rate swaps and foreign currency contracts). All of these contracts subject the Company to counterparty credit risk. As a result, the Company is subject to credit risks at various levels, including with charterers or cargo interests. If the counterparties fail to meet their obligations, the Company could suffer losses on such contracts which would decrease revenues and earnings. 
As the Company expands its business, it will need to improve its operations and financial systems, and recruit additional staff and crew; if it cannot improve these systems or recruit suitable employees, it may not effectively control its operations 
The Company&#8217;s current operating and financial systems may not be adequate as it implements its plan to expand, and its attempts to improve these systems may be ineffective. If the Company is unable to operate its financial and operations systems effectively or to recruit suitable employees for its vessels and offices as it expands its operations, it may be unable to effectively control and manage substantially larger operations. Although it is impossible to predict what errors might occur as the result of inadequate controls, it is the case that it is harder to oversee a sizable operation and, accordingly, more likely that errors will occur as operations grow and that additional management infrastructure and systems will be required to attempt to avoid such errors. 
OSG&#8217;s vessels call on ports located in countries that are subject to restrictions imposed by the U.S. government, which could negatively affect the trading price of the Company&#8217;s common stock 
From time to time, vessels in OSG&#8217;s fleet call on ports located in countries subject to sanctions and embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism, such as Iran. Although these sanctions and embargoes do not prevent OSG&#8217;s vessels from making calls to ports in these countries, potential investors could view such port calls negatively, which could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s reputation and the market for its common stock. 
OSG depends on its key personnel and may have difficulty attracting and retaining skilled employees 
OSG&#8217;s success depends to a significant extent upon the abilities and efforts of its key personnel. The loss of the services of any of the Company&#8217;s key personnel or its inability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition and operating results. 
The Company may face unexpected drydock costs for its vessels 
Vessels must be drydocked periodically. The cost of repairs and renewals required at each drydock are difficult to predict with certainty and can be substantial. The Company&#8217;s insurance does not cover these costs. In addition, vessels may have to be drydocked in the event of accidents or other unforeseen damage. OSG&#8217;s insurance may not cover all of these costs. Large drydocking expenses could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s financial results. 
Maritime claimants could arrest OSG&#8217;s vessels, which could interrupt its cash flow 
Crew members, suppliers of goods and services to a vessel, shippers of cargo and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against that vessel for unsatisfied debts, claims or damages. In many jurisdictions, a maritime lien holder may enforce its lien by arresting a vessel through foreclosure proceedings. The arrest or attachment of one or more of the Company&#8217;s vessels could interrupt OSG&#8217;s cash flow and require it to pay a significant amount of money to have the arrest lifted. In addition, in some jurisdictions, such as South Africa, under the &#8220;sister ship&#8221; theory of liability, a claimant may arrest both the vessel that is subject to the claimant&#8217;s maritime lien and any &#8220;associated&#8221; vessel, which is any vessel owned or controlled by the same owner. Claimants could try to assert &#8220;sister ship&#8221; liability against one vessel in the Company&#8217;s fleet for claims relating to another vessel in its fleet.

OSG,OVERSEAS SHIPHOLDING GROUP INC,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/75208/000114420410010646/0001144204-10-010646.txt,2010-03-01T15:29:46-05:00," ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
The following important risk factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements made in this report or presented elsewhere by management from time to time. If any of the circumstances or events described below actually arise or occur, the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 
Industry specific risk factors: 
The highly cyclical nature of the industry may lead to volatile changes in charter rates and vessel values, which may adversely affect the Company&#8217;s earnings 
Factors affecting the supply and demand for vessels are outside of the Company&#8217;s control, and the nature, timing and degree of changes in industry conditions are unpredictable and may adversely affect the values of the Company&#8217;s vessels and result in significant fluctuations in the amount of charter hire the Company may earn, which could result in significant fluctuations in OSG&#8217;s quarterly results. The factors that influence the demand for tanker capacity include: 
demand for oil and oil products, which affect the need for vessel capacity; 
global and regional economic and political conditions which among other things, could impact the supply of oil as well as trading patterns and the demand for various types of vessels; 
changes in the production of crude oil, particularly by OPEC and other key producers, which impact the need for vessel capacity; 
developments in international trade; 
changes in seaborne and other transportation patterns, including changes in the distances that cargoes are transported; 
environmental concerns and regulations; 
new pipeline construction and expansions; 
weather; and 
competition from alternative sources of energy. 
The factors that influence the supply of vessel capacity include: 
the number of newbuilding deliveries; 
the scrapping rate of older vessels; 
the number of vessels that are used for storage or as floating storage offloading service vessels; 
the conversion of vessels from transporting oil and oil products to carrying dry bulk cargo and the reverse conversion; 
the number of vessels that are out of service; and 
environmental and maritime regulations. 
An increase in the supply of vessels without an increase in demand for such vessels could cause charter rates to decline, which could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s revenues and profitability 
Historically, the marine transportation industry has been cyclical. The profitability and asset values of companies in the industry have fluctuated based on changes in the supply and demand of vessels. The supply of vessels generally increases with deliveries of new vessels and decreases with the scrapping of older vessels. The newbuilding order book equaled 31% of the existing world tanker fleet as of December 31, 2009 and no assurance can be given that the order book will not increase further in proportion to the existing fleet. If the number of new ships delivered exceeds the number of vessels being scrapped, capacity will increase. In addition, if dry bulk vessels are converted to oil tankers, the supply of oil tankers will increase. If supply increases and demand does not, the charter rates for the Company&#8217;s vessels could decline significantly. A decline in charter rates could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s revenues and profitability. 
Charter rates may decline from their current level, which could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s revenues and profitability 
Because many of the factors that influence the supply of, and demand for, tanker capacity are unpredictable and beyond the Company&#8217;s control, the nature, timing and degree of changes in charter rates are unpredictable. The global economic recession that started in 2008 and its accompanying adverse impact on demand has resulted in a decline in charter rates. The lower charter rates have adversely affected OSG&#8217;s revenues and profitability and any additional declines in charter rates could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s revenues and profitability. 
OSG&#8217;s revenues are subject to seasonal variations 
OSG operates its tankers in markets that have historically exhibited seasonal variations in demand for tanker capacity, and therefore, charter rates. Charter rates for tankers are typically higher in the fall and winter months as a result of increased oil consumption in the Northern Hemisphere. Because a majority of the Company&#8217;s vessels trade in the spot market, seasonality has affected OSG&#8217;s operating results on a quarter-to-quarter basis and could continue to do so in the future. 
The global economic recession and constraints on capital availability that commenced in 2008 adversely affects the tanker industry and OSG&#8217;s business 
The current global economic recession and constraints on capital have adversely affected the financial condition of entities throughout the world, including certain of the Company&#8217;s customers, joint venture partners, financial lenders and suppliers, including shipyards from whom the Company has contracted to purchase vessels. Those entities that suffer a material adverse impact on their financial condition may be unable or unwilling to comply with their contractual commitments to OSG which, in turn, could have an adverse impact on OSG. The failure of entities to comply with contractual commitments could include the refusal or inability of customers to pay charter hire to OSG, shipyards&#8217; failure to construct and deliver to OSG newbuilds or joint ventures&#8217; or financial lenders&#8217; inability or unwillingness to honor their commitments, such as to contribute funds to a joint venture with OSG or to lend funds to OSG. While OSG seeks to monitor the financial condition of such entities, the availability and accuracy of information about the financial condition of such entities may be limited and the actions that OSG may take to reduce possible losses resulting from the failure of such entities to comply with their contractual obligations may be restricted. See also under the heading &#8220;Company specific risk factors&#8221; below the risk factor concerning credit risks with counterparties. 
Terrorist attacks, piracy and international hostilities can affect the tanker industry, which could adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business 
Additional terrorist attacks like those in New York on September 11, 2001 and in London on July 7, 2005, piracy attacks against merchant ships, including oil tankers, particularly in the Gulf of Aden and off the East Coast of Africa, especially Somalia, the outbreak of war, or the existence of international hostilities could damage the world economy, adversely affect the availability of and demand for crude oil and petroleum products and adversely affect the Company&#8217;s ability to re-charter its vessels on the expiration or termination of the charters and the charter rates payable under any renewal or replacement charters. The Company conducts its operations internationally, and its business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by changing economic, political and government conditions in the countries and regions where its vessels are employed. Moreover, OSG operates in a sector of the economy that is likely to be adversely impacted by the effects of political instability, terrorist or other attacks, war, international hostilities or piracy. 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
The market value of vessels fluctuates significantly, which could adversely affect OSG&#8217;s liquidity, result in breaches of its financing agreements or otherwise adversely affect its financial condition 
The market value of vessels has fluctuated over time. The fluctuation in market value of vessels over time is based upon various factors, including: 
age of the vessel; 
general economic and market conditions affecting the tanker industry, including the availability of vessel financing; 
number of vessels in the world fleet; 
types and sizes of vessels available; 
changes in trading patterns affecting demand for particular sizes and types of vessels; 
cost of newbuildings; 
prevailing level of charter rates; 
competition from other shipping companies; 
other modes of transportation; and 
technological advances in vessel design and propulsion. 
Declining values of the Company&#8217;s vessels could adversely affect its liquidity by limiting its ability to raise cash by refinancing vessels. Declining vessel values could also result in a breach of loan covenants or trigger events of default under relevant financing agreements that require the Company to maintain certain loan-to-value ratios. In such instances, if OSG is unable or unwilling to pledge additional collateral to offset the decline in vessel values, its lenders could accelerate its debt and foreclose on its vessels pledged as collateral for the loans. 
Shipping is a business with inherent risks, and OSG&#8217;s insurance may not be adequate to cover its losses 
OSG&#8217;s vessels and their cargoes are at risk of being damaged or lost because of events such as: 
marine disasters; 
bad weather; 
mechanical failures; 
human error; 
war, terrorism and piracy; and 
other unforeseen circumstances or events. 
In addition, transporting crude oil creates a risk of business interruptions due to political circumstances in foreign countries, hostilities, labor strikes, port closings and boycotts. Any of these events may result in loss of revenues and increased costs. 
The Company carries insurance to protect against most of the accident-related risks involved in the conduct of its business. OSG currently maintains one billion dollars in coverage for each of its vessels for liability for spillage or leakage of oil or pollution. OSG also carries insurance covering lost revenue resulting from vessel off-hire due to vessel damage. Nonetheless, risks may arise against which the Company is not adequately insured. For example, a catastrophic spill could exceed OSG&#8217;s insurance coverage and have a material adverse effect on its operations. In addition, OSG may not be able to procure adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates in the future, and OSG cannot guarantee that any particular claim will be paid. In the past, new and stricter environmental regulations have led to higher costs for insurance covering environmental damage or pollution, and new regulations could lead to similar increases or even make this type of insurance unavailable. Furthermore, even if insurance coverage is adequate to cover the Company&#8217;s losses, OSG may not be able to timely obtain a replacement ship in the event of a loss. OSG may also be subject to calls, or premiums, in amounts based not only on its own claim records but also the claim records of all other members of the P &#38; I Associations through which OSG obtains insurance coverage for tort liability. OSG&#8217;s payment of these calls could result in significant expenses which would reduce its profits or cause losses. 
Because OSG conducts its business on a worldwide basis, OSG faces a number of significant risks that could result in losses or higher costs 
The Company&#8217;s vessels operate all over the world, exposing it to many risks, including: 
changing economic, political and social conditions in the countries where OSG does business or where its vessels are registered or flagged; 
the imposition of increased environmental and safety regulations by international organizations, Classification Societies, flag states and port states; 
the imposition of taxes by flag states, port states and jurisdictions in which OSG or its subsidiaries are incorporated or where its vessels operate; 
currency fluctuations; 
pandemics or epidemics which may result in a disruption of worldwide trade including quarantines of certain areas; 
terrorism, piracy and war, including the possible outbreak of hostilities that could reduce or otherwise affect the movement of oil from the Middle East; and 
expropriation of its vessels. 
As a result of these risks, OSG may incur losses or higher costs, including those incurred as a result of the impairment of its assets or a curtailment of its operations. 
Compliance with environmental laws or regulations , including those relating to the emission of greenhouse gases, may adversely affect OSG&#8217;s business 
The Company&#8217;s operations are affected by extensive and changing international, national and local environmental protection laws, regulations, treaties, conventions and standards in force in international waters, the jurisdictional waters of the countries in which OSG&#8217;s vessels operate, as well as the countries of its vessels&#8217; registration. Many of these requirements are designed to reduce the risk of oil spills and other pollution and to decrease emission of greenhouse gases, and OSG&#8217;s compliance with these requirements can be costly. 
These requirements can affect the resale value or useful lives of the Company&#8217;s vessels, require a reduction in carrying capacity, ship modifications or operational changes or restrictions, lead to decreased availability of insurance coverage for environmental matters or result in the denial of access to certain jurisdictional waters or ports, or detention in, certain ports. Under local, national and foreign laws, as well as international treaties and conventions, OSG could incur material liabilities, including cleanup obligations, in the event that there is a release of petroleum or other hazardous substances from its vessels or otherwise in connection with its operations. OSG could also become subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to the release of or exposure to hazardous materials associated with its current or historic operations. Violations of or liabilities under environmental requirements also can result in substantial penalties, fines and other sanctions, including in certain instances, seizure or detention of the Company&#8217;s vessels. 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
OSG could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs, fines, penalties, third-party claims and natural resource damages, as the result of an oil spill or other liabilities under environmental laws. The Company is subject to the oversight of several government agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Maritime Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation. OPA 90 affects all vessel owners shipping oil or hazardous material to, from or within the United States. OPA 90 allows for potentially unlimited liability without regard to fault for owners, operators and bareboat charterers of vessels for oil pollution in U.S. waters. Similarly, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, as amended, which has been adopted by most countries outside of the United States, imposes liability for oil pollution in international waters. OPA 90 expressly permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to hazardous materials and oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries. Coastal states in the United States have enacted pollution prevention liability and response laws, many providing for unlimited liability. 
OPA 90 provides for the scheduled phase out of all non double hull vessels that carry oil in bulk in U.S. waters. IMO and the European Union also have adopted separate phase out schedules applicable to single hull vessels operating in international and EU waters. These regulations will reduce the demand for single hull vessels, force the remaining single hull vessels into less desirable trading routes, increase the number of ships trading in routes open to single hull vessels and could increase demands for further restrictions in the remaining jurisdictions that permit the operation of these vessels. As a result, single hull vessels are likely to be chartered less frequently and at lower rates. 
In addition, in complying with OPA, IMO regulations, EU directives and other existing laws and regulations and those that may be adopted, shipowners may incur significant additional costs in meeting new maintenance and inspection requirements, in developing contingency arrangements for potential spills and in obtaining insurance coverage. Government regulation of vessels, particularly in the areas of safety and environmental requirements, can be expected to become more strict in the future and require the Company to incur significant capital expenditures on its vessels to keep them in compliance, or even to scrap or sell certain vessels altogether. As a result of accidents such as the November 2002 oil spill from the Prestige, a 26 year old single hull tanker unrelated to the Company, OSG believes that regulation of the shipping industry will continue to become more stringent and more expensive for the Company and its competitors. In recent years, the IMO and EU have both accelerated their existing non double hull phase out schedules in response to highly publicized oil spills and other shipping incidents involving companies unrelated to OSG. Future accidents can be expected in the industry, and such accidents or other events could be expected to result in the adoption of even stricter laws and regulations, which could limit the Company&#8217;s operations or its ability to do business and which could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business and financial results. Furthermore, OSG anticipates that the IMO, EU, U.S. or other countries where we operate might enact climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives that could restrict emissions of greenhouse gases. Such actions could result in significant financial and operational impacts on our business. See the discussion of &#8220;Environmental and Security Matters Relating to Bulk Shipping&#8221; above. 
The market value of OSG&#8217;s vessels, which in 2008 reached historically high levels, may be depressed at a time and in the event that it sells a vessel 
Vessel values have generally experienced high volatility and values in recent years have been at or near historically high levels. The fair market value of the Company&#8217;s vessels can be expected to fluctuate, depending on general economic and market conditions affecting the tanker industry and competition from other shipping companies, types and sizes of vessels and other modes of transportation. The global economic recession that commenced in 2008 has resulted in a decrease in vessel values. In addition, although OSG has a modern fleet, as vessels grow older, they generally decline in value. These factors will affect the value of the Company&#8217;s vessels at the time of any vessel sale. If for any reason, OSG sells a vessel at a time when prices have fallen, the sale may be at less than the vessel&#8217;s carrying amount on its financial statements, with the result that the Company would also incur a loss on the sale and a reduction in earnings and surplus. 
Company specific risk factors: 
The Company&#8217;s business would be adversely affected if it failed to comply with the Jones Act provisions on coastwise trade, or if these provisions were repealed and if changes in international trade agreements were to occur. 
The Company is subject to the Jones Act and other federal laws that restrict maritime transportation between points in the U.S. (known as marine cabotage services or coastwise trade) to vessels built and registered in the U.S. and owned and manned by U.S. citizens. The Company is responsible for monitoring the foreign ownership of its common stock and other interests to insure compliance with the Jones Act. If the Company does not comply with these restrictions, it would be prohibited from operating its vessels in U.S. coastwise trade, and under certain circumstances would be deemed to have undertaken an unapproved foreign transfer, resulting in severe penalties, including permanent loss of U.S. coastwise trading rights for the Company&#8217;s vessels, fines or forfeiture of the vessels. 
In order to ensure compliance with Jones Act citizenship requirements, and in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a requirement in July 1976 that at least 77% (the &#8220;Minimum Percentage&#8221;) of the Company&#8217;s common stock must be held by U.S. citizens. On April 16, 2008, the Company announced that U.S. ownership of our common stock at the close of business on April 15, 2008 had declined to the minimum percentage of 77%. While the percentage of U.S. citizenship ownership of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common stock fluctuates daily, the highest it has been since April 15, 2008 has been approximately 3% above the Minimum Percentage. Any purported transfer of common stock in violation of these ownership provisions will be ineffective to transfer the shares of common stock or any voting, dividend or other rights associated with them. The existence and enforcement of this U.S. citizen ownership requirement could have an adverse impact on the liquidity or market value of our common stock in the event that U.S. citizens were unable to transfer shares of our common stock to non-U.S. citizens. Furthermore, under certain circumstances this ownership requirement could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company. 
Additionally, the Jones Act restrictions on the provision of maritime cabotage services are subject to exceptions under certain international trade agreements, including the General Agreement on Trade in Services and the North American Free Trade Agreement. If maritime cabotage services were included in the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the North American Free Trade Agreement or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise repealed or altered, the transportation of maritime cargo between U.S. ports could be opened to international-flag or international- manufactured vessels. On two occasions during 2005, the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security, at the direction of the President of the U.S., issued limited waivers of the Jones Act for the transportation of petroleum and petroleum products as a result of the extraordinary circumstances created by Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita on Gulf Coast refineries and petroleum product pipelines. During the past several years, interest groups have lobbied Congress to repeal the Jones Act to facilitate international flag competition for trades and cargoes currently reserved for U.S. Flag vessels under the Jones Act and cargo preference laws. The Company believes that continued efforts will be made to modify or repeal the Jones Act and cargo preference laws currently benefiting U.S. Flag vessels. Because international vessels may have lower construction costs, wage rates and operating costs, this could significantly increase competition in the coastwise trade, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. 
OSG&#8217;s financial condition would be materially adversely affected if the shipping income of OSG&#8217;s foreign subsidiaries becomes subject to current taxation in the U.S. 
As a result of changes made by the 2004 Act, the Company does not report in taxable income on a current basis the undistributed shipping income earned by its international flag vessels, which in recent years represented substantially all of the Company&#8217;s pre-tax income. These changes in the 2004 Act were made to make U.S. controlled shipping companies competitive with foreign-controlled shipping companies, which are generally incorporated in jurisdictions in which they either do not pay income taxes or pay minimal income taxes. 
In his State of the Union address on January 27, 2010, President Obama stated that &#8220;it&#8217;s time to finally slash the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas and give those tax breaks for companies that create jobs in the United States of America&#8221;. An increasing number of Congressmen and Senators have announced support for ending such tax breaks. While the Company believes that the changes made in the 2004 Act with respect to foreign shipping income do not &#8220;ship jobs overseas,&#8221; and, in fact, have enabled the Company to expand its U.S. Flag fleet and create jobs in the U.S., Congress may decide to repeal the changes made in the 2004 Act with respect to taxation of foreign shipping income. Such repeal, either directly or indirectly by limiting or reducing benefits received under the 2004 Act, would have a materially adverse affect on the Company&#8217;s business and financial results. 
The Company&#8217;s substantial debt and charter in commitments could adversely affect its financial condition 
OSG has substantial debt and debt service requirements. At December 31, 2009, the Company&#8217;s consolidated total debt was $1.8 billion and its unused borrowing capacity under revolving credit facilities was $1.0 billion and its charter in commitments were $2.0 billion. 
The amount of the Company&#8217;s debt could have important consequences. For example, it could: 
increase OSG&#8217;s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; 
limit OSG&#8217;s ability to fund future capital expenditures, working capital and other general corporate requirements; 
require the Company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to make interest and principal payments on its debt; 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
limit OSG&#8217;s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the shipping industry; 
place OSG at a competitive disadvantage compared with competitors that have less debt or charter-in commitments including by causing OSG to have a lower credit rating; and 
limit OSG&#8217;s ability to borrow additional funds, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity. 
When OSG&#8217;s credit facilities mature, it may not be able to refinance or replace them 
The global economic downturn that started in 2008 has adversely affected the availability and terms of debt and equity capital. When OSG&#8217;s indebtedness matures, the Company may need to refinance it and may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all. If OSG is able to refinance maturing indebtedness, the terms of any refinancing or alternate credit arrangements may contain terms and covenants that restrict OSG&#8217;s financial and operating flexibility. 
The Company is highly dependent upon volatile spot market charter rates 
OSG depends on spot charters for a significant portion of its revenues. In 2009, 2008 and 2007, OSG derived approximately 49%, 65% and 60%, respectively, of its TCE revenues in the spot market. Although chartering a significant portion of OSG&#8217;s vessels on the spot market affords it greater opportunity to increase income from operations when rates rise, dependence on the spot market could result in earnings volatility. A significant decrease in OSG&#8217;s spot market TCE revenues could adversely affect its profit or result in cash losses. 
OSG may not be able to renew time charters when they expire or enter into new time charters for newbuilds 
There can be no assurance that any of the Company&#8217;s existing time charters will be renewed or that it will be successful in entering into new time charters on certain of the newbuilds that will be delivered to the Company or if renewed or entered into, that they will be at favorable rates. If, upon expiration of the existing time charters or delivery of newbuilds, OSG is unable to obtain time charters or voyage charters at desirable rates, the Company&#8217;s profitability may be adversely affected. 
Delays or cost overruns in building new vessels (including the failure to deliver new vessels), in the scheduled shipyard maintenance of the Company&#8217;s vessels, or in rebuilding or conversion of the Company&#8217;s vessels could adversely affect OSG&#8217;s results of operations 
Building new vessels, scheduled shipyard maintenance or rebuilding or conversion of vessels are subject to risks of delay (including the failure to deliver new vessels) or cost overruns caused by one or more of the following: 
financial difficulties of the shipyard building or repairing a vessel, including bankruptcy; 
unforeseen quality or engineering problems; 
work stoppages; 
weather interference; 
unanticipated cost increases; 
delays in receipt of necessary materials or equipment; 
changes to design specifications; and 
inability to obtain the requisite permits, approvals or certifications from the U.S. Coast Guard or international foreign flag state authorities and the applicable classification society upon completion of work. 
Significant delays, cost overruns and failure to deliver new vessels could materially increase the Company&#8217;s expected contract commitments, which would have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s revenues, borrowing capacity and results of operations. Furthermore, delays would result in vessels being out-of-service for extended periods of time, and therefore not earning revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations. The Company&#8217;s remedies for losses resulting from shipyards&#8217; failure to comply with their contractual commitments may be limited by the relevant contracts, including by liquidated damages provisions, such as those that limit the amount of monetary damages that may be claimed or that limit the Company&#8217;s right to cancellation of the building contract. While purchase price payments for newbuild vessels made prior to vessel delivery to international shipyards historically have been supported by guarantees from financial institutions, such as banks or insurance companies, such payments to U.S. shipyards historically have been supported by liens on the work in progress, including steel and equipment used for constructing the vessel, and not by guarantees from financial institutions. If an international shipyard fails to deliver a contracted newbuild vessel for which there is a guarantee, the Company may claim against the guarantee, substantially reducing the risk that the Company will suffer a loss of its investment. If a U.S. shipyard fails to deliver a contracted vessel, the Company&#8217;s investment may be supported only by the Company&#8217;s liens on the work in progress, which may result in a loss of part or all of the Company&#8217;s investment. 
Termination of the contracts with Bender Shipbuilding &#38; Repair Co., Inc.&#8217;s (&#8220;Bender&#8221;) has, and may continue to, adversely affect OSG 
In March 2009, OSG and Bender terminated the construction agreements pursuant to which Bender was building six ATBs and two tugs for OSG. These agreements were terminated because of Bender&#8217;s lack of performance under such agreements and its lack of liquidity and poor financial condition. OSG is completing construction of two of the six ATBs at alternative yards and intends to finish building the two tugs. 
In June 2009, certain creditors of Bender filed an involuntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition against Bender claiming that Bender was insolvent and raising questions about Bender&#8217;s pre-petition transfer of assets, specifically transfers of the vessels to OSG in connection with the termination of contracts of OSG with Bender. Bender subsequently converted the involuntary proceeding into a voluntary Chapter 11 reorganization. As creditors of Bender have raised questions regarding OSG&#8217;s termination agreement transaction it is likely that the transaction will be reviewed by authorized parties-in-interest in the bankruptcy and possibly challenged. OSG believes that the termination transaction was valid and for fair consideration, and that it has strong and meritorious defenses in the event of a challenge but no assurance can be given that the bankruptcy court will agree. However, if the bankruptcy court were to sustain a challenge to the transaction, OSG could be required to pay Bender additional sums for the partially completed ATBs and tugs and related equipment that were transferred to OSG in connection with the termination agreement transaction. In such case, the payment of additional amounts would have an adverse effect on OSG. No assurance can be given that OSG&#8217;s positions with respect to the termination agreement transaction will be upheld. 
Termination or change in the nature of OSG&#8217;s relationship with any of the pools in which it participates could adversely affect its business 
All of the Company&#8217;s VLCCs participate in the Tankers International pool. At December 31, 2009, all of OSG&#8217;s Aframaxes participate in the Aframax International pool other than those that are engaged in lightering. Five of its crude Panamaxes and three of its Panamax Product Carriers participate directly in Panamax International. Participation in these pools enhances the financial performance of the Company&#8217;s vessels as a result of the higher vessel utilization. Any participant in any of these pools has the right to withdraw upon notice in accordance with the relevant pool agreement. The Company cannot predict whether the pools in which its vessels operate will continue to exist in the future. In addition, in 2008 the EU published guidelines on the application of the EU antitrust rules to traditional agreements for maritime services. While the Company believes that all the pools it participates in comply with EU rules, there has been limited administrative and judicial interpretation of the rules. Restrictive interpretations of the guidelines could adversely affect the ability to commercially market the respective types of vessels in pools. 
OSG may not be able to grow its fleet 
One part of OSG&#8217;s strategy is to continue to grow its fleet on an opportunistic basis. The Company&#8217;s ability to grow its fleets will depend upon a number of factors, many of which the Company cannot control. These factors include OSG&#8217;s ability to: 
identify acquisition candidates and joint venture opportunities; 
replace expiring charters-in at comparable rates; 
identify suitable charter-in opportunities; 
Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
consummate acquisitions or joint ventures; 
integrate any acquired vessels or businesses successfully with its existing operations; 
hire and train qualified personnel; and 
obtain required financing. 
OSG&#8217;s strategy of growing its business in part through acquisitions is capital intensive, time consuming and subject to a number of inherent risks 
Part of OSG&#8217;s business strategy is to opportunistically acquire complementary businesses or vessels such as the Company&#8217;s acquisitions of Stelmar Shipping Ltd. in January 2005 and Maritrans Inc. in November 2006. If the Company fails to develop and integrate any acquired businesses or vessels effectively, its earnings may be adversely affected. Further, if a portion of the purchase price of a business is attributable to goodwill and if the acquired business does not perform up to expectations at the time of the acquisition some or all of the goodwill may be written off, adversely affecting OSG&#8217;s earnings. In addition, the Company&#8217;s management team will need to devote substantial time and attention to the integration of the acquired businesses or vessels, which could distract them from their other duties and responsibilities. 
Operating costs and capital expenses will increase as the Company&#8217;s vessels age 
In general, capital expenditures and other costs necessary for maintaining a vessel in good operating condition increase as the age of the vessel increases. Accordingly, it is likely that the operating costs of OSG&#8217;s older vessels will increase. In addition, changes in governmental regulations and compliance with Classification Society standards may require OSG to make additional expenditures for new equipment. In order to add such equipment, OSG may be required to take its vessels out of service. There can be no assurance that market conditions will justify such expenditures or enable OSG to operate its older vessels profitably during the remainder of their economic lives. 
OSG&#8217;s purchase of second hand vessels carries risks associated with the quality of those vessels 
OSG&#8217;s expansion strategy includes the opportunistic acquisition of quality second hand vessels either directly or through corporate acquisitions. Second hand vessels typically do not carry warranties with respect to their condition, whereas warranties are generally available for newbuildings. While the Company generally inspects all second hand vessels prior to purchase, such inspections would normally not provide OSG with as much knowledge about vessel condition as the Company would possess if the vessels had been built for it. 
Certain potential customers will not use vessels older than a specified age, even if they have been recently rebuilt 
All of our existing ATBs were originally constructed more than 25 years ago. While all of these tug-barge units were rebuilt and double-hulled since 1998 and are &#8220;in-class,&#8221; meaning the vessel has been certified by a classification society as being built and maintained in accordance with the rules of that classification society and complies with the applicable rules and regulations of the vessel&#8217;s country of registry and applicable international conventions, some potential customers have stated that they will not charter vessels that are more than 20 years old, even if they have been rebuilt. Although there has to date been no material difference in time charter rates earned by a vessel of a specified age and a rebuilt vessel of the same age measured from the date of rebuilding, no assurance can be given that customers will continue to view rebuilt vessels as comparable to newbuild vessels. If more customers differentiate between rebuilt and newbuild vessels, time charter rates for our rebuilt ATBs will likely be adversely affected or they may not be employable. 
In the highly competitive international market, OSG may not be able to effectively compete for charters with companies with greater resources 
The Company&#8217;s vessels are employed in a highly competitive market. Competition arises from other vessel owners, including major oil companies, which may have substantially greater resources than OSG does. Competition for the transportation of crude oil and other petroleum products depends on price, location, size, age, condition, and the acceptability of the vessel operator to the charterer. The Company believes that because ownership of the world tanker fleet is highly fragmented, no single vessel owner is able to influence charter rates. To the extent OSG enters into new geographic regions or provides new services, it may not be able to compete profitably. New markets may involve competitive factors that differ from those of the Company&#8217;s current markets, and the competitors in those markets may have greater financial strength and capital resources than OSG does. 
Trading and complementary hedging activities in Forward Freight Agreements (&#8220;FFAs&#8221;) subject the Company to trading risks and the Company may suffer trading losses that reduce earnings 
Due to shipping market volatility, success in this industry requires constant adjustment of the balance between chartering out vessels for long periods of time and trading them on a spot basis. The Company seeks to manage and mitigate that risk through trading and complementary hedging activities in forward freight agreements, or FFAs. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be able at all times to successfully protect itself from volatility in the shipping market. The Company may not successfully mitigate its risks, leaving it exposed to unprofitable contracts and may suffer trading losses that reduce earnings and surplus. 
The Company is subject to certain credit risks with respect to its counterparties on contracts and failure of such counterparties to meet their obligations could cause the Company to suffer losses on such contracts, decreasing revenues and earnings 
The Company charters its vessels to other parties, who pay the Company a daily rate of hire. The Company also enters into COAs and Voyage Charters. As OSG increases the portion of its revenues from time charters, it increases its reliance on the ability of time charterers to pay charter hire, especially when spot market rates are less than previously agreed upon time charter rates. Historically, the Company has not experienced any material problem collecting charter hire but the global economic recession that commenced in 2008 may affect charterers more severely than the prior recessions that have occurred since the Company&#8217;s establishment more than 40 years ago. The Company also time charters or bareboat charters some of its vessels from other parties and its continued use and operation of such vessels depends on the vessel owners&#8217; compliance with the terms of the time charter or bareboat charter. Additionally, the Company enters into derivative contracts (FFAs, bunker swaps, interest rate swaps and foreign currency contracts). All of these contracts subject the Company to counterparty credit risk. As a result, the Company is subject to credit risks at various levels, including with charterers or cargo interests. If the counterparties fail to meet their obligations, the Company could suffer losses on such contracts which would decrease revenues and earnings. 
As the Company expands its business, it will need to improve its operations and financial systems, and recruit additional staff and crew; if it cannot improve these systems or recruit suitable employees, it may not effectively control its operations 
The Company&#8217;s current operating and financial systems may not be adequate as it implements its plan to expand, and its attempts to improve these systems may be ineffective. If the Company is unable to operate its financial and operations systems effectively or to recruit suitable employees for its vessels and offices as it expands its operations, it may be unable to effectively control and manage substantially larger operations. Although it is impossible to predict what errors might occur as the result of inadequate controls, it is the case that it is harder to oversee a sizable operation and, accordingly, more likely that errors will occur as operations grow and that additional management infrastructure and systems will be required to attempt to avoid such errors. 
OSG&#8217;s ability to obtain business from U.S. government agencies may be adversely affected by a determination by the Military Sealift Command (MSC) that OSG is not presently responsible for a single contract. 
OSG Product Tankers, LLC (&#8220;Product Tankers&#8221;), which is an indirect OSG subsidiary, participated in a Request for Proposals issued by the MSC, an agency of the United States Department of the Navy, to time charter two Jones Act compliant product carriers to the MSC. On June 25, 2007, the U.S. Maritime Administration of the Department of Transportation (&#8220;MarAd&#8221;), acting as lead federal agency under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (&#8220;FAR&#8221;), entered into a compliance agreement with OSG in lieu of suspending or debarring OSG from business with the U.S. Government based on the December 2006 guilty plea by OSG to violations related to the handling of bilge water and oily mixtures from the engine rooms on certain of its international flag vessels. Notwithstanding that compliance agreement, on July 6, 2007, the MSC found that Product Tankers was not &#8220;responsible,&#8221; pursuant to the FAR, for the particular procurement based on the same violations by OSG&#8217;s international flag vessels and, therefore, was ineligible to time charter the vessels to the MSC. MSC&#8217;s non-responsibility determination was upheld by the United States Court of Federal Claims, which ruled that the MSC was not bound by the MarAd&#8217;s decision as lead federal agency and that the MSC decision was not arbitrary and capricious. 
Although the MSC decision specifically addresses only the single contract, it may have an adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s ability to obtain business from the U.S. government. For the past three years, OSG did not do any material business with the MSC and, accordingly, did not generate any shipping revenues from the MSC. Historically, OSG has not sought to generate significant revenues from conducting business with the MSC or other agencies and departments within the U.S. government, nor does OSG intend to in the future. The only business OSG currently conducts with the U.S. government is the participation by two of its vessels in the Maritime Security Program (&#8220;MSP&#8221;), which is intended to support the operation of up to 60 U.S. Flag vessels in the foreign commerce of the U.S. to make available a fleet of privately owned vessels to the Department of Defense during times of war or national emergency. Payments are made under the MSP to vessel operators, including OSG, to help offset the high cost of employing a U.S. crew. MarAd, the agency which decided not to suspend or debar OSG, administers the MSP. To date, the MSC decision has not had an adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s ability to obtain business from commercial customers.

Compliance with the environmental compliance plan agreed to with the U.S. Department of Justice imposes a more rigorous standard on OSG&#8217;s technical management of its vessels, which may adversely affect its business 
In connection with the comprehensive settlement of the investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice of the Company&#8217;s handling of waste oils and maintenance of books and records relating thereto, the Company agreed to implement and fund an environmental compliance plan, which contains detailed rules, programs and procedures that the Company must follow for a three year period from March 2007 to ensure full compliance with environmental laws and regulations. The Company has implemented these rules, programs and procedures and does not believe that they will adversely affect its ability to technically manage its vessels in a competitive manner. However, because the environmental compliance plan is a condition of the Company&#8217;s three year probation, violations of certain of these rules and procedures, while not necessarily a violation of environmental laws and regulations, could result in sanctions and have an adverse affect on the Company&#8217;s business. 
OSG&#8217;s vessels call on ports located in countries that are subject to restrictions imposed by the U.S. government, which could negatively affect the trading price of the Company&#8217;s common stock 
From time to time, vessels in OSG&#8217;s fleet call on ports located in countries subject to sanctions and embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism, such as Iran. Although these sanctions and embargoes do not prevent OSG&#8217;s vessels from making calls to ports in these countries, potential investors could view such port calls negatively, which could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s reputation and the market for its common stock. 
OSG depends on its key personnel and may have difficulty attracting and retaining skilled employees 
OSG&#8217;s success depends to a significant extent upon the abilities and efforts of its key personnel. The loss of the services of any of the Company&#8217;s key personnel or its inability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#8217;s business, financial condition and operating results. 
The Company may face unexpected drydock costs for its vessels 
Vessels must be drydocked periodically. The cost of repairs and renewals required at each drydock are difficult to predict with certainty and can be substantial. The Company&#8217;s insurance does not cover these costs. In addition, vessels may have to be drydocked in the event of accidents or other unforeseen damage. OSG&#8217;s insurance may not cover all of these costs. Large drydocking expenses could significantly decrease the Company&#8217;s profits. 
Maritime claimants could arrest OSG&#8217;s vessels, which could interrupt its cash flow 
Crew members, suppliers of goods and services to a vessel, shippers of cargo and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against that vessel for unsatisfied debts, claims or damages. In many jurisdictions, a maritime lien holder may enforce its lien by arresting a vessel through foreclosure proceedings. The arrest or attachment of one or more of the Company&#8217;s vessels could interrupt OSG&#8217;s cash flow and require it to pay a significant amount of money to have the arrest lifted. In addition, in some jurisdictions, such as South Africa, under the &#8220;sister ship&#8221; theory of liability, a claimant may arrest both the vessel that is subject to the claimant&#8217;s maritime lien and any &#8220;associated&#8221; vessel, which is any vessel owned or controlled by the same owner. Claimants could try to assert &#8220;sister ship&#8221; liability against one vessel in the Company&#8217;s fleet for claims relating to another vessel in its fleet.

The following important risk factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements made in this report or presented elsewhere by management from time to time. If any of the circumstances or events described below actually arise or occur, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 
Industry specific risk factors: 
The highly cyclical nature of the industry may lead to volatile changes in charter rates and vessel values, which may adversely affect the Company's earnings 
Factors affecting the supply and demand for vessels are outside of the Company's control, and the nature, timing and degree of changes in industry conditions are unpredictable and may adversely affect the values of the Company's vessels and result in significant fluctuations in the amount of charter hire the Company may earn, which could result in significant fluctuations in OSG's quarterly results. The factors that influence the demand for tanker capacity include: 
Historically, the marine transportation industry has been cyclical. The profitability and asset values of companies in the industry have fluctuated based on changes in the supply and demand of vessels. The supply of vessels generally increases with deliveries of new vessels and decreases with the scrapping of older vessels. The newbuilding order book equaled 36.6% of the existing world tanker fleet as of December 31, 2006 and no assurance can be given that the order book will not increase further in proportion to the existing fleet. If the number of new ships delivered exceeds the number of vessels being scrapped, capacity will increase. If supply increases and demand does not, the charter rates for the Company's vessels could decline significantly. A decline in charter rates could have a material adverse effect on OSG's revenues and profitability. 
2006 Annual Report 25 
Charter rates may decline from their current level, which could have a material adverse effect on OSG's revenues and profitability 
Because many of the factors that influence the supply of, and demand for, tanker capacity are unpredictable and beyond the Company's control, the nature, timing and degree of changes in charter rates are unpredictable. A decline in charter rates could have a material adverse effect on OSG's revenues and profitability. 
OSG's revenues are subject to seasonal variations 
OSG operates its tankers in markets that have historically exhibited seasonal variations in demand for tanker capacity, and therefore, charter rates. Charter rates for tankers are typically higher in the fall and winter months as a result of increased oil consumption in the Northern Hemisphere. Because a majority of the Company's vessels trade in the spot market, seasonality has affected OSG's operating results on a quarter-to-quarter basis and could continue to do so in the future. 
Terrorist attacks and international hostilities can affect the tanker industry, which could adversely affect OSG's business 
Additional terrorist attacks like those in New York on September 11, 2001 and in London on July 7, 2005, the outbreak of war or the existence of international hostilities could damage the world economy, adversely affect the availability of and demand for crude oil and petroleum products and adversely affect the Company's ability to re-charter its vessels on the expiration or termination of the charters and the charter rates payable under any renewal or replacement charters. The Company conducts its operations internationally, and its business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by changing economic, political and government conditions in the countries and regions where its vessels are employed. Moreover, OSG operates in a sector of the economy that is likely to be adversely impacted by the effects of political instability, terrorist or other attacks, war or international hostilities. 
The market value of vessels fluctuates significantly, which could adversely affect OSG's liquidity, result in breaches of its financing agreements or otherwise adversely affect its financial condition 
The market value of vessels has fluctuated over time. The fluctuation in market value of vessels over time is based upon various factors, including: 
26 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
Shipping is a business with inherent risks, and OSG's insurance may not be adequate to cover its losses 
OSG's vessels and their cargoes are at risk of being damaged or lost because of events such as: 
The Company carries insurance to protect against most of the accident-related risks involved in the conduct of its business. OSG currently maintains one billion dollars in coverage for each of its vessels for liability for spillage or leakage of oil or pollution. OSG also carries insurance covering lost revenue resulting from vessel off-hire due to vessel damage. Nonetheless, risks may arise against which the Company is not adequately insured. For example, a catastrophic spill could exceed OSG's insurance coverage and have a material adverse effect on its operations. In addition, OSG may not be able to procure adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates in the future, and OSG cannot guarantee that any particular claim will be paid. In the past, new and stricter environmental regulations have led to higher costs for insurance covering environmental damage or pollution, and new regulations could lead to similar increases or even make this type of insurance unavailable. Furthermore, even if insurance coverage is adequate to cover the Company's losses, OSG may not be able to timely obtain a replacement ship in the event of a loss. OSG may also be subject to calls, or premiums, in amounts based not only on its own claim records but also the claim records of all other members of the P &#38; I Associations through which OSG obtains insurance coverage for tort liability. OSG's payment of these calls could result in significant expenses which would reduce its profits or cause losses. 
Because OSG conducts its business on a worldwide basis, OSG faces a number of significant risks that could result in losses or higher costs 
The Company's vessels operate all over the world, exposing it to many risks, including: 
2006 Annual Report 27 
Compliance with environmental laws or regulations may adversely affect OSG's business 
The Company's operations are affected by extensive and changing international, national and local environmental protection laws, regulations, treaties, conventions and standards in force in international waters, the jurisdictional waters of the countries in which OSG's vessels operate, as well as the countries of its vessels' registration. Many of these requirements are designed to reduce the risk of oil spills and other pollution, and OSG's compliance with these requirements can be costly. 
These requirements can affect the resale value or useful lives of the Company's vessels, require a reduction in carrying capacity, ship modifications or operational changes or restrictions, lead to decreased availability of insurance coverage for environmental matters or result in the denial of access to certain jurisdictional waters or ports, or detention in, certain ports. Under local, national and foreign laws, as well as international treaties and conventions, OSG could incur material liabilities, including cleanup obligations, in the event that there is a release of petroleum or other hazardous substances from its vessels or otherwise in connection with its operations. OSG could also become subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to the release of or exposure to hazardous materials associated with its current or historic operations. Violations of or liabilities under environmental requirements also can result in substantial penalties, fines and other sanctions, including in certain instances, seizure or detention of the Company's vessels. 
OSG could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs, fines, penalties, third-party claims and natural resource damages, as the result of an oil spill or other liabilities under environmental laws. See ""Item 3. Legal Proceedings"" for a discussion of OSG's recent settlement of U.S. Government claims relating to its handling of waste oils and maintenance of books and records related thereto. The Company is subject to the oversight of several government agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Maritime Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation. OPA 90 affects all vessel owners shipping oil or hazardous material to, from or within the United States. OPA 90 allows for potentially unlimited liability without regard to fault for owners, operators and bareboat charterers of vessels for oil pollution in U.S. waters. Similarly, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, as amended, which has been adopted by most countries outside of the United States, imposes liability for oil pollution in international waters. OPA 90 expressly permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to hazardous materials and oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries. Coastal states in the United States have enacted pollution prevention liability and response laws, many providing for unlimited liability. 
OPA 90 provides for the scheduled phase out of all non double hull vessels that carry oil in bulk in U.S. waters. IMO and the European Union also have adopted separate phase out schedules applicable to single hull vessels operating in international and EU waters. These regulations will reduce the demand for single hull vessels, force the remaining single hull vessels into less desirable trading routes, increase the number of ships trading in routes open to single hull vessels and could increase demands for further restrictions in the remaining jurisdictions that permit the operation of these vessels. As a result, single hull vessels are likely to be chartered less frequently and at lower rates. 
In addition, in complying with OPA, IMO regulations, EU directives and other existing laws and regulations and those that may be adopted, shipowners may incur significant additional costs in meeting new maintenance and inspection requirements, in developing contingency arrangements for potential spills and in obtaining insurance coverage. Government regulation of vessels, particularly in the areas of safety and environmental requirements, can be expected to become more strict in the future and require the Company to incur significant capital expenditures on its vessels to keep them in compliance, or even to scrap or sell certain vessels altogether. As a result of accidents such as the November 2002 oil spill from the Prestige, a 26 year old single hull tanker unrelated to the Company, OSG believes that regulation of the shipping industry will continue to become more stringent and more expensive for the Company and its competitors. In recent years, the IMO and EU have both accelerated their existing non double hull phase out schedules in response to highly publicized oil spills and other shipping incidents involving companies unrelated to OSG. Future accidents can be expected in the industry, and such accidents or other events could be expected to result in the adoption of even stricter laws and regulations, which could limit the Company's operations or its ability to do business and which could have a material adverse effect on OSG's business and financial results.

The market value of OSG's vessels, which have recently been at or near historically high levels, may be depressed at a time and in the event that it sells a vessel 
Vessel values have generally experienced high volatility and values have recently been at or near historically high levels. The fair market value of the Company's vessels can be expected to fluctuate, depending on general economic and market conditions affecting the tanker industry and competition from other shipping companies, types and sizes of vessels and other modes of transportation. In addition, although OSG has a modern fleet, as vessels grow older, they generally decline in value. These factors will affect the value of the Company's vessels at the time of any vessel sale. If for any reason, OSG sells a vessel at a time when prices have fallen, the sale may be at less than the vessel's carrying amount on its financial statements, with the result that the Company would also incur a loss on the sale and a reduction in earnings and surplus. 
Company specific risk factors: 
OSG's financial condition would be materially adversely affected if the shipping income of OSG's foreign subsidiaries becomes subject to current taxation in the U.S. 
As a result of changes made by the 2004 Act, the Company does not report in taxable income on a current basis the undistributed shipping income earned by its international flag vessels, which in recent years represented substantially all of the Company's pre-tax income. These changes in the 2004 Act were made to make U.S. controlled shipping companies competitive with foreign-controlled shipping companies, which are generally incorporated in jurisdictions in which they either do not pay income taxes or pay minimal income taxes. 
The Congressional elections in 2006 resulted in Democratic majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The Democrats, in their platform for the 2006 elections, said that they would seek to ""repeal tax giveaways that encourage companies to move jobs overseas."" While the Company believes that the changes made in the 2004 Act with respect to foreign shipping income do not ""move jobs overseas,"" and, in fact, have enabled the Company to expand its U.S. Flag fleet and create jobs in the U.S., Congress may decide to repeal the changes made in the 2004 Act with respect to taxation of foreign shipping income. Such a repeal would have a materially adverse affect on the Company's business and financial results. 
The Company's substantial debt could adversely affect its financial condition 
OSG has substantial debt and debt service requirements. At December 31, 2006, the Company's consolidated total debt, including capital lease obligations, was $1.34 billion and its unused borrowing capacity under revolving credit facilities was $1.24 billion. 
The amount of the Company's debt could have important consequences. For example, it could: 
When OSG's indebtedness matures, the Company may need to refinance it and may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all. If OSG is able to refinance maturing indebtedness, the terms of any refinancing or alternate credit arrangements may contain terms and covenants that restrict OSG's financial and operating flexibility. 
2006 Annual Report 29 
The Company is highly dependent upon volatile spot market charter rates 
OSG depends on spot charters for a significant portion of its revenues. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, OSG derived approximately 69%, 69% and 85%, respectively, of its TCE revenues in the spot market. Although chartering a significant portion of OSG's vessels on the spot market affords it greater opportunity to increase income from operations when rates rise, dependence on the spot market could result in earnings volatility. A significant decrease in OSG's spot market TCE revenues could adversely effect its profit or result in cash losses. 
OSG may not be able to renew time charters when they expire or enter into new time charters for newbuilds 
There can be no assurance that any of the Company's existing time charters will be renewed or that it will be successful in entering into new time charters on certain of the newbuilds that will be delivered to the Company or if renewed or entered into, that they will be at favorable rates. If, upon expiration of the existing time charters or delivery of newbuilds, OSG is unable to obtain time charters or voyage charters at desirable rates, the Company's profitability may be adversely affected. 
Termination or change in the nature of OSG's relationship with any of the pools in which it participates could adversely affect its business 
All of the Company's VLCCs participate in the Tankers International pool. All of OSG's Aframaxes participate in the Aframax International pool. Five of its Panamaxes participate directly in Panamax International. Participation in these pools enhances the financial performance of the Company's vessels as a result of the higher vessel utilization. Any participant in any of these pools has the right to withdraw upon notice in accordance with the relevant pool agreement. The Company cannot predict whether the pools in which its vessels operate will continue to exist in the future. In addition, the EU is in the process of substantially reforming the way it regulates traditional agreements for maritime services from an antitrust perspective. These changes may impose new restrictions on the way the pools are operated and may prohibit such pooling arrangements altogether. The termination of any of these pools, any significant restriction on pooling arrangements or the withdrawal of any participants could adversely affect the ability to commercially market the respective types of vessels in pools. 
OSG may not be able to grow its fleet 
One part of OSG's strategy is to continue to grow its fleet on an opportunistic basis. The Company's ability to grow its fleets will depend upon a number of factors, many of which the Company cannot control. These factors include OSG's ability to: 
Part of OSG's business strategy is to opportunistically acquire complementary businesses or vessels such as the Company's acquisitions of Stelmar Shipping Ltd. in January 2005 and Maritrans Inc. in November 2006. If the Company fails to develop and integrate any acquired businesses or vessels effectively, its earnings may be adversely affected. In addition, the Company's management team will need to devote substantial time and attention to the integration of the acquired businesses or vessels, which could distract them from their other duties and responsibilities. 
30 Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc. 
Operating costs and capital expenses will increase as the Company's vessels age 
In general, capital expenditures and other costs necessary for maintaining a vessel in good operating condition increase as the age of the vessel increases. Accordingly, it is likely that the operating costs of OSG's older vessels will increase. In addition, changes in governmental regulations and compliance with Classification Society standards may require OSG to make additional expenditures for new equipment. In order to add such equipment, OSG may be required to take its vessels out of service. There can be no assurance that market conditions will justify such expenditures or enable OSG to operate its older vessels profitably during the remainder of their economic lives. 
OSG's purchase of second hand vessels carries risks associated with the quality of those vessels 
OSG's expansion strategy includes the opportunistic acquisition of quality second hand vessels either directly or through corporate acquisitions. Second hand vessels typically do not carry warranties with respect to their condition, whereas warranties are generally available for newbuildings. While the Company generally inspects all second hand vessels prior to purchase, such inspections would normally not provide OSG with as much knowledge about vessel condition as the Company would possess if the vessels had been built for it. 
Delays or cost overruns in building new vessels, the double-hulling of certain vessels or in the scheduled shipyard maintenance of the Company's vessels could adversely affect OSG's results of operations 
Building new vessels, rebuilding certain of the Company's existing single-hulled barges and scheduled shipyard maintenance of vessels may be subject to the risks of delay or cost overruns caused by one or more of the following: 
The Company's business would be adversely affected if it failed to comply with the Jones Act provisions on coastwise trade, or if these provisions were repealed and if changes in international trade agreements were to occur 
The Company is subject to the Jones Act and other federal laws that restrict maritime transportation between points in the U.S. (known as marine cabotage services or coastwise trade) to vessels built and registered in the U.S. and owned and manned by U.S. citizens. The Company is responsible for monitoring the ownership of its common stock and other interests to insure compliance with the Jones Act. If the Company does not comply with these restrictions, it would be prohibited from operating its vessels in U.S. coastwise trade, and under certain circumstances would be deemed to have undertaken an unapproved foreign transfer, resulting in severe penalties, including permanent loss of U.S. coastwise trading rights for the Company's vessels, fines or forfeiture of the vessels. 
Additionally, the Jones Act restrictions on the provision of maritime cabotage services are subject to exceptions under certain international trade agreements, including the General Agreement on Trade in Services and the North American Free Trade Agreement. If maritime cabotage services were included in the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the North American Free Trade Agreement or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise repealed or altered, the transportation of maritime cargo between U.S. ports could be opened to international-flag or international-manufactured vessels. On two occasions during 2005, the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security, at the direction of the President of the U.S., issued limited waivers of the Jones Act for the transportation of petroleum and petroleum products as a result of the extraordinary circumstances created by Hurricane 
2006 Annual Report 31 
Katrina and Hurricane Rita on Gulf Coast refineries and petroleum product pipelines. During the past several years, interest groups have lobbied Congress to repeal the Jones Act to facilitate international flag competition for trades and cargoes currently reserved for U.S. Flag vessels under the Jones Act and cargo preference laws. The Company believes that continued efforts will be made to modify or repeal the Jones Act and cargo preference laws currently benefiting U.S. Flag vessels. Because international vessels may have lower construction costs, wage rates and operating costs, this could significantly increase competition in the coastwise trade, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. 
In the highly competitive international market, OSG may not be able to effectively compete for charters with companies with greater resources 
The Company's vessels are employed in a highly competitive market. Competition arises from other vessel owners, including major oil companies, which may have substantially greater resources than OSG does. Competition for the transportation of crude oil and other petroleum products depends on price, location, size, age, condition, and the acceptability of the vessel operator to the charterer. The Company believes that because ownership of the world tanker fleet is highly fragmented, no single vessel owner is able to influence charter rates. To the extent OSG enters into new geographic regions or provide new services, it may not be able to compete profitably. New markets may involve competitive factors that differ from those of the Company's current markets, and the competitors in those markets may have greater financial strength and capital resources than OSG does. 
Trading and complementary hedging activities in Forward Freight Agreements (""FFAs"") and related FFA options subject the Company to trading risks and the Company may suffer trading losses that reduce earnings 
Due to shipping market volatility, success in this industry requires constant adjustment of the balance between chartering out vessels for long periods of time and trading them on a spot basis. The Company seeks to manage and mitigate that risk through trading and complementary hedging activities in forward freight agreements, or FFAs, and related FFA options. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be able at all times to successfully protect itself from volatility in the shipping market. The Company may not successfully mitigate its risks, leaving it exposed to unprofitable contracts and may suffer trading losses that reduce earnings and surplus. 
The Company is subject to certain credit risks with respect to its counterparties on contracts and failure of such counterparties to meet their obligations could cause the Company to suffer losses on such contracts, decreasing revenues and earnings 
The Company charters its vessels to other parties, who pay the Company a daily rate of hire. The Company also enters into Contracts of Affreightment (""COAs"") and Voyage Charters. As OSG increases the portion of its revenues from time charters, it increases its reliance on the ability of time charterers to pay charter hire, especially when spot market rates are less than previously agreed upon time charter rates. Historically, the Company has not experienced any material problem collecting charter hire. Additionally, the Company enters into FFAs. All of these contracts subject the Company to counterparty credit risk. As a result, the Company is subject to credit risks at various levels, including with charterers or cargo interests. If the counterparties fail to meet their obligations, the Company could suffer losses on such contracts which would decrease revenues and earnings. 
As the Company expands its business, it will need to improve its operations and financial systems, and recruit additional staff and crew; if it cannot improve these systems or recruit suitable employees, it may not effectively control its operations 
The Company's current operating and financial systems may not be adequate as it implements its plan to expand, and its attempts to improve these systems may be ineffective. If the Company is unable to operate its financial and operations systems effectively or to recruit suitable employees for its vessels and offices as it expands its operations, it may be unable to effectively control and manage substantially larger operations. Although it is impossible to predict what errors might occur as the result of inadequate controls, it is the case that it is harder to oversee a sizable operation and, accordingly, more likely that errors will occur as operations grow and that additional management infrastructure and systems will be required to attempt to avoid such errors.

Compliance with the environmental compliance plan agreed to with the U.S. Department of Justice imposes a more rigorous standard on OSG's technical management of its vessels, which may adversely affect its business 
In connection with the comprehensive settlement of the investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice of the Company's handling of waste oils and maintenance of books and records relating thereto, the Company agreed to implement and fund an environmental compliance plan, which contains detailed rules, programs and procedures that the Company must follow to ensure full compliance with environmental laws and regulations. The Company has implemented these rules, programs and procedures and does not believe that they will adversely affect its ability to technically manage its vessels in a competitive manner. However, because the environmental compliance plan is a condition of the Company's probation, violations of certain of these rules and procedures, while not necessarily a violation of environmental laws and regulations, could result in sanctions and have an adverse affect on the Company's business. 
OSG's vessels call on ports located in countries that are subject to restrictions imposed by the U.S. government, which could negatively affect the trading price of the Company's common stock 
From time to time, vessels in OSG's fleet call on ports located in countries subject to sanctions and embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism, such as Syria and Iran. Although these sanctions and embargoes do not prevent OSG's vessels from making calls to ports in these countries, potential investors could view such port calls negatively, which could adversely affect the Company's reputation and the market for its common stock. 
OSG depends on its key personnel and may have difficulty attracting and retaining skilled employees 
OSG's success depends to a significant extent upon the abilities and efforts of its key personnel. The loss of the services of any of the Company's key personnel or its inability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on OSG's business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, of the Company's 11 executive officers, eight have served in their current positions for less than two years as of December 31, 2006. 
The Company may face unexpected drydock costs for its vessels 
Vessels must be drydocked periodically. The cost of repairs and renewals required at each drydock are difficult to predict with certainty and can be substantial. The Company's insurance does not cover these costs. In addition, vessels may have to be drydocked in the event of accidents or other unforeseen damage. OSG's insurance may not cover all of these costs. Large drydocking expenses could significantly decrease the Company's profits. 
Maritime claimants could arrest OSG's vessels, which could interrupt its cash flow 
Crew members, suppliers of goods and services to a vessel, shippers of cargo and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against that vessel for unsatisfied debts, claims or damages. In many jurisdictions, a maritime lien holder may enforce its lien by arresting a vessel through foreclosure proceedings. The arrest or attachment of one or more of the Company's vessels could interrupt OSG's cash flow and require it to pay a significant amount of money to have the arrest lifted. In addition, in some jurisdictions, such as South Africa, under the ""sister ship"" theory of liability, a claimant may arrest both the vessel that is subject to the claimant's maritime lien and any ""associated"" vessel, which is any vessel owned or controlled by the same owner. Claimants could try to assert ""sister ship"" liability against one vessel in the Company's fleet for claims relating to another vessel in its fleet. 
Governments could requisition OSG's vessels during a period of war or emergency without adequate compensation 
A government could requisition one or more of OSG's vessels for title or for hire. Requisition for title occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and becomes her owner, while requisition for hire occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and effectively becomes her charterer at dictated charter rates. Generally, requisitions occur during periods of war or emergency, although governments may elect to requisition vessels in other circumstances. Although OSG would be entitled to compensation in the event of a requisition of one or more of its vessels, the amount and timing of payment would be uncertain. Government requisition of one or more of OSG's vessels may negatively impact its revenues.

The following important risk factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements made in this report or presented elsewhere by management from time to time. If any of the circumstances or events described below actually arise or occur, the Company&#146;s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 
Industry specific risk factors: 
The highly cyclical nature of the tanker industry may lead to volatile changes in charter rates and vessel values, which may adversely affect the Company&#146;s earnings 
Factors affecting the supply and demand for tankers are outside of the Company&#146;s control, and the nature, timing and degree of changes in industry conditions are unpredictable and may adversely affect the values of the Company&#146;s vessels and result in significant fluctuations in the amount of charter hire the Company may earn, which could result in significant fluctuations in OSG&#146;s quarterly results. The factors that influence the demand for tanker capacity include: 
The factors that influence the supply of tanker capacity include: 
An increase in the supply of tankers without an increase in demand for tankers could cause charter rates to decline, which could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#146;s revenues and profitability 
Historically, the tanker industry has been cyclical. The profitability and asset values of companies in the industry have fluctuated based on changes in the supply and demand of tankers. The supply of tankers generally increases with deliveries of new vessels and decreases with the scrapping of older vessels. The newbuilding order book equaled 24.6% of the existing world tanker fleet as of December 31, 2005 and no assurance can be given that the order book will not increase further in proportion to 
the existing fleet. If the number of new ships delivered exceeds the number of vessels being scrapped, tanker capacity will increase. If the supply of tanker capacity increases and the demand for tanker capacity does not, the charter rates for the Company&#146;s vessels could decline significantly. A decline in charter rates could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#146;s revenues and profitability. 
Charter rates may decline from their current level, which could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#146;s revenues and profitability 
Because many of the factors that influence the supply of, and demand for, tanker capacity are unpredictable and beyond the Company&#146;s control, the nature, timing and degree of changes in charter rates are unpredictable. A decline in charter rates could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#146;s revenues and profitability. 
OSG&#146;s revenues are subject to seasonal variations 
OSG operates its tankers in markets that have historically exhibited seasonal variations in demand for tanker capacity, and therefore, charter rates. Charter rates for tankers are typically higher in the fall and winter months as a result of increased oil consumption in the Northern Hemisphere. Because a majority of the Company&#146;s vessels trade in the spot market, seasonality has affected OSG&#146;s operating results on a quarter-to-quarter basis and could continue to do so in the future. 
Terrorist attacks and international hostilities can affect the tanker industry, which could adversely affect OSG&#146;s business 
Additional terrorist attacks like those in New York on September 11, 2001 and in London on July 7, 2005, the outbreak of war or the existence of international hostilities could damage the world economy, adversely affect the availability of and demand for crude oil and petroleum products and adversely affect the Company&#146;s ability to re-charter its vessels on the expiration or termination of the charters and the charter rates payable under any renewal or replacement charters. The Company conducts its operations internationally, and its business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by changing economic, political and government conditions in the countries and regions where its vessels are employed. Moreover, OSG operates in a sector of the economy that is likely to be adversely impacted by the effects of political instability, terrorist or other attacks, war or international hostilities. 
The market value of vessels fluctuates significantly, which could adversely affect OSG&#146;s liquidity, result in breaches of its financing agreements or otherwise adversely affect its financial condition 
The market value of vessels has fluctuated over time. The fluctuation in market value of oil tankers over time is based upon various factors, including: 
Declining vessel values of the Company&#146;s tankers could adversely affect its liquidity by limiting its ability to raise cash by refinancing vessels. Declining vessel values could also result in a breach of loan covenants or trigger events of default under relevant financing agreements that require the Company to maintain certain loan-to-value ratios. In such instances, if OSG is unable to pledge additional collateral to offset the decline in vessel values, its lenders could accelerate its debt and foreclose on its vessels pledged as collateral for the loans. 
Shipping is a business with inherent risks, and OSG&#146;s insurance may not be adequate to cover its losses 
OSG&#146;s vessels and their cargoes are at risk of being damaged or lost because of events such as: 
In addition, transporting crude oil creates a risk of business interruptions due to political circumstances in foreign countries, hostilities, labor strikes, port closings and boycotts. Any of these events may result in loss of revenues and increased costs. 
The Company carries insurance to protect against most of the accident-related risks involved in the conduct of its business. OSG currently maintains one billion dollars in coverage for each of its vessels for liability for spillage or leakage of oil or pollution. OSG also carries insurance covering lost revenue resulting from vessel off-hire due to vessel damage. Nonetheless, risks may arise against which the Company is not adequately insured. For example, a catastrophic spill could exceed OSG&#146;s insurance coverage and have a material adverse effect on its operations. In addition, OSG may not be able to procure adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates in the future, and OSG cannot guarantee that any particular claim will be paid. In the past, new and stricter environmental regulations have led to higher costs for insurance covering environmental damage or pollution, and new regulations could lead to similar increases or even make this type of insurance unavailable. Furthermore, even if insurance coverage is adequate to cover the Company&#146;s losses, OSG may not be able to timely obtain a replacement ship in the event of a loss. OSG may also be subject to calls, or premiums, in amounts based not only on its own claim records but also the claim records of all other members of the P &#38; I Associations through which OSG obtains insurance coverage for tort liability. OSG&#146;s payment of these calls could result in significant expenses which would reduce its profits or cause losses. 
Because OSG conducts its business on a worldwide basis, OSG faces a number of significant risks that could result in losses or higher costs 
The Company&#146;s vessels operate all over the world, exposing it to many risks, including: 
As a result of these risks, OSG may incur losses or higher costs, including those incurred as a result of the impairment of its assets or a curtailment of its operations. 
Compliance with environmental laws or regulations may adversely affect OSG&#146;s business 
The Company&#146;s operations are affected by extensive and changing international, national and local environmental protection laws, regulations, treaties, conventions and standards in force in international waters, the jurisdictional waters of the countries in which OSG&#146;s vessels operate, as well as the countries of its vessels&#146; registration. Many of these requirements are designed to reduce the risk of oil spills and other pollution, and OSG&#146;s compliance with these requirements can be costly. 
These requirements can affect the resale value or useful lives of the Company&#146;s vessels, require a reduction in carrying capacity, ship modifications or operational changes or restrictions, lead to decreased availability of insurance coverage for environmental matters or result in the denial of access to certain jurisdictional waters or ports, or detention in, certain ports. Under local, national and foreign laws, as well as international treaties and conventions, OSG could incur material liabilities, including cleanup obligations, in the event that there is a release of petroleum or other hazardous substances from our vessels or otherwise in connection with its operations. OSG could also become subject to personal injury or property damage claims relating to the release of or exposure to hazardous materials associated with its current or historic operations. Violations of or liabilities under environmental requirements also can result in substantial penalties, fines and other sanctions, including in certain instances, seizure or detention of the Company&#146;s vessels. 
OSG could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs, fines, penalties, third-party claims and natural resource damages, as the result of an oil spill or other liabilities under environmental laws. OPA 90 affects all vessel owners shipping oil or hazardous material to, from or within the United States. OPA 90 allows for potentially unlimited liability without regard to fault for owners, operators and bareboat charterers of vessels for oil pollution in U.S. waters. Similarly, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969, as amended, which has been adopted by most countries outside of the United States, imposes liability for oil pollution in international waters. OPA 90 expressly permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to hazardous materials and oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries. Coastal states in the United States have enacted pollution prevention liability and response laws, many providing for unlimited liability. 
OPA 90 provides for the scheduled phase out of all non double hull tankers that carry oil in bulk in U.S. waters. IMO and the European Union also have adopted separate phase out schedules applicable to single hull tankers operating in international and EU waters. These regulations will reduce the demand for single hull tankers, force the remaining single hull vessels into less desirable trading routes, increase the number of ships trading in routes open to single hull vessels and could increase demands for further restrictions in the remaining jurisdictions that permit the operation of these vessels. As a result, single hull vessels are likely to be chartered less frequently and at lower rates. 
In addition, in complying with OPA, IMO regulations, EU directives and other existing laws and regulations and those that may be adopted, shipowners may incur significant additional costs in meeting new maintenance and inspection requirements, in developing contingency arrangements for potential spills and in obtaining insurance coverage. Government regulation of vessels, particularly in the areas of safety and environmental requirements, can be expected to become more strict in the future and require the Company to incur significant capital expenditures on its vessels to keep them in compliance, or even to scrap or sell certain vessels altogether. As a result of accidents such as the November 2002 oil spill from the Prestige, a 26 year old single hull tanker unrelated to the Company, OSG believes that regulation of the shipping industry will continue to become more stringent and more expensive for the Company and its competitors. In recent years, the IMO and EU have both accelerated their existing non double hull phase out schedules in response to highly publicized oil spills and other shipping incidents involving companies unrelated to OSG. Future accidents can be expected in the industry, and such accidents or other events could be expected to result in the adoption of even stricter laws and regulations, which could limit the Company&#146;s operations or its ability to do business and which could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#146;s business and financial results. For additional information concerning a pending government investigation of the Company&#146;s handling of waste oils, see the Company specific risk factor with such heading on Page 37. 
The market value of OSG&#146;s vessels, which are at or near historically high levels, may be depressed at a time and in the event that it sells a vessel 
Tankers values have generally experienced high volatility and values are currently at or near historically high levels. The fair market value of the Company&#146;s tankers can be expected to fluctuate, depending on general economic and market conditions affecting the tanker industry and competition from other shipping companies, types and sizes of vessels and other modes of transportation. In addition, although OSG has a modern fleet, as vessels grow older, they generally decline in value. These factors will affect the value of the Company&#146;s vessels at the time of any vessel sale. If for any reason, OSG sells a tanker at a time when tanker prices have fallen, the sale may be at less than the tanker&#146;s carrying amount on its financial statements, with the result that the Company would also incur a loss on the sale and a reduction in earnings and surplus. 
Company specific risk factors: 
The Company&#146;s substantial debt could adversely affect our financial condition 
OSG has substantial debt and debt service requirements. At December 31, 2005, the Company&#146;s consolidated total debt, including capital lease obligations, was $993 million and its unused borrowing capacity under revolving credit facilities was $1.15 billion. 
The amount of the Company&#146;s debt could have important consequences. For example, it could: 
When OSG&#146;s credit facilities mature, it may not be able to refinance or replace them 
When OSG&#146;s indebtedness matures, the Company may need to refinance it and may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all. If OSG is able to refinance maturing indebtedness, the terms of any refinancing or alternate credit arrangements may contain terms and covenants that restrict OSG&#146;s financial and operating flexibility. 
The Company is highly dependent upon volatile spot market charter rates 
OSG depends on spot charters for a significant portion of its revenues. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, OSG derived approximately 69%, 85% and 79%, respectively, of its TCE revenues in the spot market. 
Although chartering a significant portion of OSG&#146;s vessels on the spot market affords it greater opportunity to increase income from operations when rates rise, dependence on the spot market could result in earnings volatility. 
OSG may not be able to renew time charters when they expire or enter into new time charters for newbuilds 
There can be no assurance that any of the Company&#146;s existing time charters will be renewed or that it will be successful in entering into new time charters on certain of the newbuilds that the Company is chartering-in; or if renewed or entered into, that they will be at favorable rates. If, upon expiration of the existing time charters or delivery of newbuilds, OSG is unable to obtain time charters or voyage charters at desirable rates, the Company&#146;s profitability may be adversely affected. 
OSG is dependent on the creditworthiness of its customers 
As OSG increases the portion of its revenues from time charters, it increases its reliance on the ability of time charterers to pay charter hire, especially when spot market rates are less than previously agreed upon time charter rates. Historically, the Company has not experienced any material problem collecting charter hire. 
Termination or change in the nature of OSG&#146;s relationship with any of the pools in which it participates could adversely affect its business 
All of the Company&#146;s VLCCs participate in the Tankers International pool. All but one (which is operating on time charter) of OSG&#146;s Aframaxes participate in the Aframax International pool. Five of its Panamaxes participate in Panamax International. Participation in these pools enhances the financial performance of the Company&#146;s vessels as a result of the higher vessel utilization. Any participant in any of these pools has the right to withdraw upon notice in accordance with the relevant pool agreement. The termination of any of these pools or the withdrawal of any participants could adversely affect OSG&#146;s ability to commercially market the respective types of vessels. 
OSG may not be able to grow its fleet 
One part of OSG&#146;s strategy is to continue to grow its fleet on an opportunistic basis. The Company&#146;s ability to grow its fleets will depend upon a number of factors, many of which the Company cannot control. These factors include OSG&#146;s ability to: 
OSG&#146;s strategy of growing its business in part through acquisitions is capital intensive, time consuming and subject to a number of inherent risks 
Part of OSG&#146;s business strategy is to opportunistically acquire complementary businesses or vessels such as the Company&#146;s acquisition of Stelmar Shipping Ltd. in January 2005. If the Company fails to develop and integrate any acquired businesses or vessels effectively, its earnings may be adversely affected. In addition, the Company&#146;s management team will need to devote substantial time and attention to the integration of the acquired businesses or vessels, which could distract them from their other duties and responsibilities. 
Operating costs and capital expenses will increase as the Company&#146;s vessels age 
In general, capital expenditures and other costs necessary for maintaining a vessel in good operating condition increase as the age of the vessel increases. Accordingly, it is likely that the operating costs of OSG&#146;s older vessels will increase. In addition, changes in governmental regulations and compliance with Classification Society standards may require OSG to make additional expenditures for new equipment. In order to add such equipment, OSG may be required to take its vessels out of service. There can be no assurance that market conditions will justify such expenditures or enable OSG to operate its older vessels profitably during the remainder of their economic lives. 
OSG&#146;s purchase of second hand vessels carries risks associated with the quality of those vessels 
OSG&#146;s expansion strategy includes the opportunistic acquisition of quality second hand vessels. Second hand vessels typically do not carry warranties with respect to their condition, whereas warranties are generally available for newbuildings. While the Company generally inspects all second hand vessels prior to purchase, such an inspection would normally not provide OSG with as much knowledge about vessel condition as the Company would possess if the vessels had been built for it. 
In the highly competitive international tanker market, OSG may not be able to effectively compete for charters with companies with greater resources 
The Company&#146;s vessels are employed in a highly competitive market. Competition arises from other tanker owners, including major oil companies, which may have substantially greater resources than OSG does. Competition for the transportation of crude oil and other petroleum products depends on price, location, size, age, condition, and the acceptability of the vessel operator to the charterer. The Company believes that because ownership of the world tanker fleet is highly fragmented, no single vessel owner is able to influence charter rates. To the extent OSG enters into 
new geographic regions or provide new services, it may not be able to compete profitably. New markets may involve competitive factors which differ from those of the Company&#146;s current markets, and the competitors in those markets may have greater financial strength and capital resources than it does. 
OSG is being investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice relating to the handling of waste oils 
On October 1, 2003, the U.S. Department of Justice served a grand jury subpoena directed at our International Flag Product Carrier, the Uranus, and our handling of waste oils and maintenance of books and records relating thereto. The U.S. Department of Justice has subsequently served related subpoenas requesting documents concerning the Uranus and other vessels in the Company&#146;s fleet and a number of witnesses have appeared before grand juries. In 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, the Company made a total provision of $10 million (including $4 million in the first quarter of 2005) for anticipated fines and contributions to environmental protection programs associated with a possible settlement of the investigation. The Company has been cooperating with the investigation, including self-reporting to the government beginning in the second half of 2005 of possible additional violations of applicable environmental laws. Currently, management cannot reasonably estimate a range of such fines and contributions, which fines and contributions could be higher than the amount accrued. Negotiations with the U.S. Department of Justice are continuing but there can be no assurance that a satisfactory settlement can be achieved. 
OSG&#146;s vessels call on ports located in countries that are subject to restrictions imposed by the U.S. government, which could negatively affect the trading price of the Company&#146;s common stock 
From time to time, vessels in OSG&#146;s fleet call on ports located in countries subject to sanctions and embargoes imposed by the U.S. government and countries identified by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism, such as Libya, Syria and Iran. Libya currently is not subject to economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. government, but continues to be identified as a state sponsor of terrorism. Although these sanctions and embargoes do not prevent OSG&#146;s vessels from making calls to ports in these countries, potential investors could view such port calls negatively, which could adversely affect the Company&#146;s reputation and the market for its common stock. 
OSG depends on its key personnel and may have difficulty attracting and retaining skilled employees 
OSG&#146;s success depends to a significant extent upon the abilities and efforts of its key personnel. The loss of the services of any of the Company&#146;s key personnel or its inability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on OSG&#146;s business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, of the Company&#146;s ten executive officers, seven have served in their current positions for less than one year and two of the remaining three officers have served in such positions for less than two years. 
The Company may face unexpected drydock costs for its vessels 
Vessels must be drydocked periodically. The cost of repairs and renewals required at each drydock are difficult to predict with certainty and can be substantial. The Company&#146;s insurance does not cover these costs. In addition, vessels may have to be drydocked in the event of accidents or other unforeseen damage. OSG&#146;s insurance may not cover all of these costs. Large drydocking expenses could significantly decrease the Company&#146;s profits. 
Maritime claimants could arrest OSG&#146;s tankers, which could interrupt its cash flow 
Crew members, suppliers of goods and services to a vessel, shippers of cargo and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against that vessel for unsatisfied debts, claims or damages. In many jurisdictions, a maritime lien holder may enforce its lien by arresting a vessel through foreclosure proceedings. The arrest or attachment of one or more of the Company&#146;s vessels could interrupt OSG&#146;s cash flow and require it to pay a significant amount of money to have the arrest lifted. In addition, in some jurisdictions, such as South Africa, under the &#147;sister ship&#148; theory of liability, a claimant may arrest both the vessel that is subject to the claimant&#146;s maritime lien and any &#147;associated&#148; vessel, which is any vessel owned or controlled by the same owner. Claimants could try to assert &#147;sister ship&#148; liability against one vessel in the Company&#146;s fleet for claims relating to another vessel in its fleet. 
Governments could requisition OSG&#146;s vessels during a period of war or emergency without adequate compensation 
A government could requisition one or more of OSG&#146;s vessels for title or for hire. Requisition for title occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and becomes her owner, while requisition for hire occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and effectively becomes her charterer at dictated charter rates. Generally, requisitions occur during periods of war or emergency, although governments may elect to requisition vessels in other circumstances. Although OSG would be entitled to compensation in the event of a requisition of one or more of its vessels, the amount and timing of payment would be uncertain. Government requisition of one or more of OSG&#146;s vessels may negatively impact its revenues.
