PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results can be affected by many factors, including estimates and assumptions used in the critical accounting estimates described in Item 7. MD&#38;A, that can cause their actual financial results to differ materially from historical results or from anticipated future financial results. The following discussion of key risk factors should be considered in evaluating an investment in PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility and should be read in conjunction with Item 7. MD&#38;A and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this 2023 Form 10-K. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.

Risks related to wildfires, including risks related to: 
Risks related to operations and information technology, including risks related to: 
Risks related to environmental factors, including risks related to: 
Risks related to enforcement matters, investigations, and regulatory proceedings, including risks related to: 
Risks related to financial conditions, including risks related to: 
Risks Related to Wildfires 
The Wildfire Fund and other provisions of AB 1054 may not effectively mitigate the risk of liability for damages arising from catastrophic wildfires. 
If the Utility does not have an approved WMP, the Utility will not be issued a safety certification and will consequently not benefit from the presumption of prudency or the AB 1054 disallowance cap. Under AB 1054, the Utility is required to maintain a safety certification issued by the OEIS to be eligible for certain benefits, including a cap on Wildfire Fund reimbursement and a reformed prudent manager standard. The AB 1054 Wildfire Fund disallowance cap, which caps the amount of liability that the Utility could be required to bear for a catastrophic wildfire, is inapplicable if the Wildfire Fund administrator determines that the electric utility company&#8217;s actions or inactions that resulted in the applicable wildfire constituted &#8220;conscious or willful disregard for the rights and safety of others,&#8221; or the electric utility company fails to maintain a valid safety certification at the time the applicable wildfire ignited. In addition, if the Utility fails to maintain a valid safety certification at the time a wildfire ignites, the initial burden of proof in a prudency proceeding shifts from intervenors to the Utility. The Utility will be required to reimburse amounts that are determined by the CPUC not to be just and reasonable. For more information on the disallowance cap, see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 
Furthermore, the Wildfire Fund will only be available for payment of eligible claims so long as there are sufficient funds remaining in the Wildfire Fund. Such funds could be depleted more quickly than expected, including as a result of claims made by California&#8217;s other participating electric utility companies. If the Utility is unable to maintain an AB 1054 safety certification or if the Wildfire Fund is exhausted, the inability to access the Wildfire Fund could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. Also, the Utility will not be able to obtain any recovery from the Wildfire Fund for wildfire-related losses in any year that do not exceed the greater of $1.0 billion in the aggregate and the amount of insurance coverage required under AB 1054. 
The costs of participating in the Wildfire Fund are expected to exceed $6.7 billion over the ten-year contribution period for the fund. The timing and amount of any potential charges associated with the Utility&#8217;s contributions would also depend on various factors. In addition, there could also be a significant delay between the occurrence of a wildfire and the timing on which the Utility recognizes impairment for the reduction in future coverage due to the lack of data available to the Utility following a catastrophic event, especially if the wildfire occurs in the service area of another participating electric utility. Participation in the Wildfire Fund is expected to have a material impact on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows, and the benefits of participating in the Wildfire Fund may not ultimately outweigh these substantial costs. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility could be liable as a result of the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, the 2022 Mosquito fire, or future wildfires. 
Based on the facts and circumstances available as of the date of this report, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have determined that it is probable they will incur losses in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, and the 2022 Mosquito fire. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s recorded liabilities for probable losses in connection with these fires correspond to the lower end of the range of reasonably estimable losses unless there is a better estimate, do not include several categories of potential damages that are not reasonably estimable, and are subject to change based on new information. The Utility could be subject to significant liability in excess of recoveries that would be expected to have a material impact on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have been the subject of investigations, regulatory enforcement actions, or criminal proceedings in connection with wildfires and could be the subject of additional investigations, regulatory enforcement actions, or criminal proceedings in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, the 2022 Mosquito fire, or other wildfires. For more information, see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 
Under California law (including Penal Code section 1202.4), if the Utility were convicted of any charges in connection with a wildfire, the sentencing court must order the Utility to &#8220;make restitution to the victim or victims in an amount established by court order&#8221; that is &#8220;sufficient to fully reimburse the victim or victims for every determined economic loss incurred as the result of&#8221; the Utility&#8217;s underlying conduct, in addition to interest and the victim&#8217;s or victims&#8217; attorneys&#8217; fees. This requirement for full reimbursement of economic loss is not waivable by either the government or the victims and is not offset by any compensation that the victims have received or may receive from their insurance carriers. 
There have been numerous other wildfires in the Utility&#8217;s service area, of which the Utility has not been alleged or determined to be a cause. The Utility could be alleged or determined to be a cause of one or more of these wildfires. 
Additionally, under the doctrine of inverse condemnation, courts have imposed liability against utilities on the grounds that losses borne by the person whose property was damaged through a public-use undertaking should be spread across the community that benefited from such undertaking, even if the utility is unable to recover these costs through rates. In fact, in December 2017, the CPUC denied recovery of costs that San Diego Gas &#38; Electric Company stated it had incurred as a result of the doctrine of inverse condemnation. Legal challenges to that denial were unsuccessful. Plaintiffs have asserted and continue to assert the doctrine of inverse condemnation in lawsuits related to certain wildfires that occurred in the Utility&#8217;s service area. Inverse condemnation imposes strict liability (including liability for attorneys&#8217; fees) for damages as a result of the design, construction and maintenance of utility facilities, including utilities&#8217; electric transmission lines. The Utility continues to dispute the applicability of inverse condemnation to the Utility, but the Utility may not be successful in challenging the applicability of inverse condemnation in the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, the 2022 Mosquito fire, or other litigation against PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility. 
Although the Utility has taken extensive measures to reduce the threat of future wildfires, the potential that the Utility&#8217;s equipment will be involved in the ignition of future wildfires, including catastrophic wildfires, is significant. This risk may be attributable to, and exacerbated by, a variety of factors, including climate (in particular, extended periods of seasonal dryness coupled with periods of high wind velocities and other storms), infrastructure, and vegetation conditions. The Utility&#8217;s significant infrastructure investment, vegetation management, and de-energization strategies do not eliminate wildfire risk and may not prevent future wildfires. Once an ignition has occurred, the Utility is unable to control the extent of damages. The extent of damages for a wildfire is primarily determined by environmental conditions (including weather and vegetation conditions), third-party suppression efforts, and the location of the wildfire. 
In addition, wildfires have had and could continue to have (as a result of any future wildfires) adverse consequences on the Utility&#8217;s proceedings with the CPUC and the FERC, and future regulatory proceedings, including future applications with the OEIS for the safety certification required by AB 1054. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility may also suffer additional reputational harm and face an even more challenging operating, political, and regulatory environment as a result of the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, the 2022 Mosquito fire, or any future wildfires. For more information about the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, and the 2022 Mosquito fire, see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 
The Utility may be unable to recover all or a significant portion of its costs in excess of insurance coverage in connection with wildfires, through rates, or from the Wildfire Fund in a timely manner. 
The Utility could incur substantial costs in excess of insurance coverage or amounts potentially available under the Wildfire Fund under AB 1054 in the future in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, and the 2022 Mosquito fire. The Utility may not be allowed to recover costs in excess of insurance or amounts potentially available under the Wildfire Fund under AB 1054 in the future either through FERC TO rates or as costs recorded to the WEMA, even if a court decision were to determine that the Utility is liable as a result of the application of the doctrine of inverse condemnation. The inability to recover all or a significant portion of costs in excess of insurance through rates or by collecting such rates in a timely manner could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. For more information on wildfire recovery risk, see &#8220;The Wildfire Fund and other provisions of AB 1054 may not effectively mitigate the risk of liability for damages arising from catastrophic wildfires&#8221; above and Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 
The Utility may not effectively implement its wildfire mitigation initiatives. 
The Utility&#8217;s infrastructure is aging and poses risks to safety and system reliability. The Utility&#8217;s wildfire mitigation initiatives may not be successful or effective in preventing or reducing wildfire-related losses. The Utility will face a higher likelihood of catastrophic wildfires in its service area if it cannot effectively implement these efforts and its WMPs. For example, the Utility may not be able to effectively implement its WMPs if it experiences unanticipated difficulties relative to sourcing, engaging, training, overseeing, or retaining contract workers it needs to fulfill its mitigation obligations under the WMPs. The CPUC will assess penalties on the Utility if there is a finding that the Utility has failed to substantially comply with its WMPs. 
Wildfires can occur even when the Utility follows its procedures. For instance, a wildfire may be ignited and spread even in conditions that do not trigger proactive de-energization according to criteria for initiating a PSPS event or where EPSS has been implemented on Utility equipment. The Utility&#8217;s inspections of vegetation near its assets may not detect structural weaknesses within a tree or other issues. If the Utility&#8217;s wildfire mitigation initiatives are not effective, a wildfire could be ignited and spread. 
In addition, on a risk-informed basis, the Utility is making efforts to reduce the frequency and impacts of PSPS. The Utility may be subject to mandated changes to, or restrictions on, its operational practices, regulatory fines and penalties, claims for damages, and reputational harm if the Utility does not execute PSPS in compliance with applicable rules and regulations. The Utility establishes the criteria under which it implements PSPS in its territory. To the extent the Utility&#8217;s criteria for implementing PSPS are not sufficient to mitigate the risk of wildfires, the Utility does not fully implement PSPS when criteria are met due to other overriding conditions or the Utility&#8217;s regulators mandate changes to, or restrictions on, its criteria or other operational PSPS practices, the Utility will face a higher likelihood of catastrophic wildfires in its territory during high-risk weather conditions. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility cannot predict the timing and outcome of the various proceedings and litigation in connection with its wildfire mitigation initiatives. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility could be subject to additional investigations, regulatory proceedings, or other enforcement actions as well as to additional litigation and claims by customers as a result of the Utility&#8217;s implementation of its wildfire mitigation initiatives, which could result in fines, penalties, customer rebates, other payments, or the Utility&#8217;s failure to obtain cost recovery for amounts expended on these initiatives. The amount of any fines, penalties, customer rebates or other payments (if PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility were to issue any credits, rebates or other payments in connection with any other wildfire mitigation initiatives or liability for damages) could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. In addition, the PSPS and EPSS programs have had an adverse impact on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s reputation with customers, regulators and policymakers and future PSPS events and EPSS outages may increase these negative perceptions. For more information, see &#8220;Regulatory Matters&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A. 
Risks Related to Operations and Information Technology 
The Utility&#8217;s electricity and natural gas operations are inherently hazardous and involve significant risks. 
The Utility owns and operates extensive electricity and natural gas facilities, including two nuclear generation units and an extensive hydroelectric generating system. See &#8220;Electric Utility Operations&#8221; and &#8220;Natural Gas Utility Operations&#8221; in Item 1 above. The Utility undertakes substantial capital investment projects to construct, replace, and improve its electricity and natural gas facilities. In addition, the Utility is obligated to decommission its electricity generation facilities at the end of their useful operating lives. For more information, see &#8220;The operation and decommissioning of the Utility&#8217;s nuclear generation facilities expose it to potentially significant liabilities, and the Utility may not be able to fully recover its costs if regulatory requirements or operating conditions change or the facilities cease operations before the licenses expire&#8221; below. 
The Utility&#8217;s ability to efficiently construct, maintain, operate, protect, and decommission its facilities, and provide electricity and natural gas services safely and reliably is subject to numerous risks, some of which are beyond the Utility&#8217;s control, including those that arise from: 
The occurrence of any of these events could interrupt fuel supplies, affect demand for electricity or natural gas, cause unplanned outages or reduce generating output, damage the Utility&#8217;s assets or operations, damage the assets or operations of third parties on which the Utility relies, damage property owned by customers or others, and cause personal injury or death. As a result, the Utility could incur costs to purchase replacement power, to repair assets and restore service, and to compensate third parties. Any such incidents also could lead to significant claims against the Utility. 
Further, the Utility often enters into agreements for third-party contractors to perform work, such as patrolling and inspection of facilities, vegetation management, or the construction or demolition or facilities, and the Utility may have less control over contractors than its employees. The Utility may retain liability for the quality and completion of the contractor&#8217;s work and can be subject to penalties or other enforcement action if the contractor violates applicable laws, rules, regulations, or orders. The Utility may also be subject to liability, penalties or other enforcement action as a result of personal injury or death caused by third-party contractor actions or inactions. 
Insurance, equipment warranties, or other contractual indemnification requirements may not be sufficient or effective to provide full or even partial recovery under all circumstances or against all hazards or liabilities to which the Utility may become subject. An uninsured loss could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The electric power and natural gas industries are undergoing significant changes driven by technological advancements and a decarbonized economy, which could lead to the reduction in demand for natural gas as an energy resource that could impact the Utility&#8217;s ability to recover through rates its investment. 
The electric power industry is undergoing transformative change driven by technological advancements enabling customer choice and state climate policy supporting a decarbonized economy. California utilities also are experiencing increasing deployment by customers and third parties of distributed energy resources, such as on-site solar generation, electric vehicles, electric heat pump space conditioning and water heating, battery electric storage, fuel cells, energy efficiency, and demand response technologies. These developments will require further modernization of the electric distribution grid to, among other things, accommodate increasing two-way flows of electricity and increase the grid&#8217;s capacity to interconnect these resources. In addition, enabling California&#8217;s clean energy transition will require sustained investments in grid modernization, renewable energy integration projects, energy efficiency programs, energy storage options, electric vehicle infrastructure, and state infrastructure modernization (e.g., rail and water projects). The Utility may be unable to effectively adapt to these potential business and regulatory changes, for instance by failing to meet customer demand for new business interconnections in a timely manner. The CPUC is also conducting proceedings to evaluate changes to the planning and operation of the electric distribution grid in order to prepare for higher penetration of distributed energy resources and consider future grid modernization and grid reinforcement investments; evaluate if traditional grid investments can be deferred by distributed energy resources, and if feasible, what, if any, compensation to utilities would be appropriate for enabling those investments; and clarify the role of the electric distribution grid operator. If the Utility is unable to effectively adapt to these potential business and regulatory changes its business model and its ability to execute on its strategy could be materially impacted. 
Various jurisdictions within California have enacted prohibitions or restrictions on use and consumption of natural gas, for example in buildings, that will reduce the use of natural gas. Reducing natural gas use reduces the gas customer base and could diminish the need for gas infrastructure and, as a result, could lead to certain gas assets no longer being &#8220;used and useful,&#8221; potentially causing substantial investment value of gas assets to be stranded (under CPUC precedent, when an asset no longer meets the standard of &#8220;used and useful,&#8221; the asset is removed from rate base, which results in a reduction in associated rate recovery). A substantial reduction in natural gas as an energy source in California without adequate and appropriate recovery of investments could result in impairment of the Utility&#8217;s natural gas infrastructure assets if they were not permitted to be repurposed for alternative fuels, were required to be depreciated on an accelerated basis, or were to become stranded. However, even as natural gas demand is projected to decline over time, the costs of operating a safe and reliable gas delivery system in California have been increasing, among other things, to cover the cost of long-term pipeline safety enhancements. If the Utility is unable to recover through rates its investments into the natural gas system while still ensuring gas system safety and reliability, its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
These industry changes, costs associated with complying with new regulatory developments and initiatives and with technological advancements, or the Utility&#8217;s inability to successfully adapt to changes in the electric and gas industry, could materially affect the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The Utility&#8217;s operational networks and information technology systems could be impacted by a cyber incident, cybersecurity breach, or physical attack. 
The Utility&#8217;s electricity and natural gas systems rely on a complex, interconnected network of generation, transmission, distribution, control, and communication technologies, which can be damaged by natural events-such as severe weather or seismic events and by malicious events, such as physical and cyber attacks. Nationally, there has been an increase in physical attacks on substations. Physical attacks targeting the Utility&#8217;s physical assets or personnel could cause damage, disrupt operations, or cause injuries. Cyber attacks targeting utility systems are significant and are continuing to increase in sophistication, magnitude, and frequency. Any failure, interruption, or decrease in the functionality of the Utility&#8217;s operational networks could cause harm to the public or employees, significantly disrupt operations, negatively impact the Utility&#8217;s ability to safely generate, transport, deliver and store energy and gas or otherwise operate in a safe and efficient manner or at all, and damage the Utility&#8217;s assets or operations or those of third parties. 
The Utility also relies on complex information technology systems that allow it to create, collect, use, disclose, store and otherwise process sensitive information, including the Utility&#8217;s financial information, customer energy usage and billing information, and personal information regarding customers, employees and their dependents, contractors, and other individuals, and portions of such sensitive information may be required to be encrypted by the Utility. In addition, the Utility is increasingly being required to disclose large amounts of data (including customer energy usage and personal information regarding customers) to support changes to California&#8217;s electricity market related to grid modernization and customer choice. The Utility often relies on third-party vendors to host, maintain, modify, and update its systems (including providing security updates), and to provide other services to the Utility or the Utility&#8217;s customers. These third-party vendors could cease to exist, fail to adopt and implement adequate processes to protect the Utility&#8217;s systems and information, fail to provide timely software updates (and even if timely provided, there could be a delay in the installation of the updates), fail to detect security vulnerabilities, or experience security incidents or inadequate security measures. Any such incidents or disruptions in the Utility&#8217;s information technology systems could impact the Utility&#8217;s ability to track or collect revenues and to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility face various cybersecurity threats, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to their systems and networks, denial-of-service attacks, threats to their information technology infrastructure, ransomware and phishing attacks, and attempts to gain unauthorized access to confidential or sensitive information about the Utility, customers and employees. These threats come from a variety of highly organized actors, including nation-state actors. PG&#38;E Corporation, the Utility and their third-party vendors have been subject to, and will likely continue to be subject to, threats, breaches and attempts to gain unauthorized access to the Utility&#8217;s information technology systems or confidential or sensitive data (including information about customers and employees), or to disrupt the Utility&#8217;s operations. The Utility may not be able to prevent unauthorized access to its operational networks, information technology systems or data, or the disruption of its operations. Such events could subject the Utility to significant expenses, claims by customers or third parties, government inquiries, penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, investigations, lawsuits, and regulatory actions and could result in material fines, penalties, loss of customers, and harm to PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s reputation, any of which could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s business strategy, financial condition, or results of operations. For more information, see Item 1C. Cybersecurity. 
The Utility maintains cyber liability insurance that covers certain losses and damages caused by cyber incidents, but adequate insurance may not continue to be available at rates the Utility believes are reasonable, or the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident may not be covered by insurance or recoverable through rates. 
The operation and decommissioning of the Utility&#8217;s nuclear generation facilities expose it to potentially significant liabilities, and the Utility may not be able to fully recover its costs if regulatory requirements or operating conditions change or the facilities cease operations before the licenses expire. 
The operation of the Utility&#8217;s nuclear generation facilities exposes it to potentially significant liabilities from environmental, health, and financial risks, such as risks relating to operation of the Diablo Canyon nuclear generation units as well as the storage, handling, and disposal of spent nuclear fuel, and the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity, natural disaster, or terrorist act. If the Utility incurs losses that are either not covered by insurance or exceed the amount of insurance coverage available, such losses could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. In addition, the Utility may be required under federal law to pay up to $275 million of liabilities arising out of each nuclear incident occurring not only at the Utility&#8217;s Diablo Canyon facility but at any other nuclear power plant in the United States. 
The Utility continues to face public concern about the safety of nuclear generation and nuclear fuel. Some of these nuclear opposition groups regularly file petitions at the NRC and in other forums challenging the actions of the NRC and urging governmental entities to adopt laws or policies in opposition to nuclear power. Even if an action in opposition ultimately fails, regulatory proceedings may take longer to conclude and be more costly to complete. It is also possible that public pressure could grow leading to adverse changes in legislation, regulations, orders, or their interpretation. As a result, operations at the Utility&#8217;s two nuclear generation units at Diablo Canyon could cease before their respective current licenses expire in 2024 and 2025 or prior to the expiration of any renewed license and extended operations period. In such an instance, the Utility could be required to record a charge for the remaining amount of its unrecovered investment and such charge could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
In addition, in order to retain highly skilled personnel necessary to safely operate Diablo Canyon during the remaining years of operations, the Utility will incur costs in connection with (i) an employee retention program to ensure adequate staffing levels at Diablo Canyon, and (ii) an employee retraining and development program, to facilitate redeployment of a portion of Diablo Canyon personnel to the decommissioning project and elsewhere in the Utility. The Utility may not be successful in retaining highly skilled personnel under its employee programs. 
The Utility is pursuing the extension of operations at Diablo Canyon through no later than 2030. If Diablo Canyon enters extended operations, the Utility will face operational challenges resulting from a shortened planning period. For instance, the Utility may be unable to procure an adequate supply of nuclear fuel. For more information, see &#8220;Extension of Diablo Canyon Operations&#8221; under &#8220;Other Regulatory Proceedings&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A. 
The Utility has incurred, and may continue to incur, substantial costs to comply with NRC regulations and orders. See &#8220;Regulatory Environment&#8221; in Item 1. Business above. If the Utility were unable to recover these costs, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. The Utility may determine that it cannot comply with the new regulations or orders in a feasible and economic manner and voluntarily cease operations; alternatively, the NRC may order the Utility to cease operations until the Utility can comply with new regulations, orders, or decisions. The Utility may incur a material charge if it ceases operations at Diablo Canyon&#8217;s two nuclear generation units before their respective current licenses expire in 2024 and 2025. As of December 31, 2023, the Utility&#8217;s unrecovered investment in Diablo Canyon was $595 million. 
The Utility also has an obligation to decommission its electricity generation facilities, including its nuclear facilities, as well as gas transmission system assets, at the end of their useful lives. See &#8220;Asset Retirement Obligations&#8221; in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement in Item 8. The Utility&#8217;s costs to decommission its nuclear facilities through nuclear decommissioning are subject to reasonableness review by the CPUC. The Utility will be responsible for any costs that the CPUC determines were not reasonably incurred, which could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The Utility may be unable to attract and retain specialty personnel and may face workforce disruptions. 
The Utility&#8217;s workforce is aging, and many employees are or will become eligible to retire within the next few years. The Utility&#8217;s efforts to recruit and train new field service personnel may be ineffective, and the Utility may be faced with a shortage of experienced and qualified personnel in certain specialty operational positions. Additionally, the Utility could experience workforce disruptions from personnel in those positions as a result of labor activity, the COVID-19 pandemic or other pandemics, or governmental regulation of pandemic protections. If the Utility were to experience such a shortage or disruptions, work stoppages could occur. 
Any such occurrences could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
Risks Related to Environmental Factors 
Severe weather events, extended drought, and climate change could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility. 
Extreme weather, drought and shifting climate patterns have intensified the challenges associated with many of the other risks facing PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility, particularly wildfire management in California. The Utility&#8217;s service area encompasses some of the most densely forested areas in California and, as a consequence, is subject to higher risk from vegetation-related ignition events than other California IOUs. Further, environmental extremes, such as drought conditions and extreme heat followed by periods of wet weather, can drive additional vegetation growth (which can then fuel fires) and influence both the likelihood and severity of extraordinary wildfire events. In particular, the risk posed by wildfires, including during the recent wildfire seasons, has increased in the Utility&#8217;s service area as a result of an ongoing extended period of drought, bark beetle infestations in the California forest, and wildfire fuel increases due to rising temperatures and record rainfall following the drought, and strong wind events, among other environmental factors. Precipitation patterns in California vary significantly from year to year, often leading to periods of severe to extreme drought. Drought conditions often occur and can persist in nearly all of the Utility&#8217;s service area depending on the amount of precipitation received in the current or previous water years. More than half of the Utility&#8217;s service area is in an HFTD. Contributing factors other than environmental can include local land use policies and historical forestry management practices. The combined effects of extreme weather and climate change also impact this risk. In January 2018, the CPUC approved a statewide fire-threat map that shows that approximately half of the Utility&#8217;s service area is facing &#8220;elevated&#8221; or &#8220;extreme&#8221; fire danger. Approximately 25,000 circuit miles of the Utility&#8217;s nearly 80,000 distribution overhead circuit miles and approximately 5,500 miles of the nearly 18,000 transmission overhead circuit miles are in such HFTDs, significantly more in total than other California IOUs. 
Severe weather events and other natural disasters, including wildfires and other fires, storms, tornadoes, floods, extreme heat events, drought, earthquakes, lightning, tsunamis, rising sea levels, pandemics, solar events, electromagnetic events, wind events or other weather-related conditions, climate change, or natural disasters, could result in severe business or operational disruptions, prolonged power outages, property damage, injuries and loss of life, significant decreases in revenues and earnings, and significant additional costs to PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility. Any such event could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. Any such event also could lead to significant claims against the Utility. Further, these events could result in regulatory penalties and disallowances, particularly if the Utility encounters difficulties in restoring power to its customers on a timely basis or if the related losses are found to be the result of the Utility&#8217;s practices or the failure of electric and other equipment of the Utility. 
Further, the Utility has been studying the potential effects of climate change (increased severity and frequency of storm events, sea level rise, land subsidence, change in temperature extremes, changes in precipitation patterns and drought, and wildfire) on its assets, operations, and services, and the Utility is developing adaptation plans to set forth a strategy for those events and conditions that the Utility believes are most significant. Consequences of these climate-driven events may vary widely and could include increased stress on the energy supply network due to new patterns of demand, reduced hydroelectric output, physical damage to the Utility&#8217;s infrastructure, higher operational costs, and an increase in the number and duration of customer outages and safety consequences for both employees and customers. As a result, the Utility&#8217;s hydroelectric generation could change, and the Utility would need to consider managing or acquiring additional generation. If the Utility increases its reliance on conventional generation resources to replace hydroelectric generation and to meet increased customer demand, it may become more costly for the Utility to comply with GHG emissions limits. In addition, climate hazards such as heatwaves, windstorms, and flooding caused by rising sea levels and extreme storms could damage the Utility&#8217;s facilities, including gas, generation, and electric transmission and distribution assets. The Utility could incur substantial costs to repair or replace facilities, restore service, or compensate customers and other third parties for damages or injuries, or regulators could order the Utility to perform additional work. The Utility anticipates that the increased costs would generally be recovered through rates, but as rate pressures increase, the likelihood of disallowance or non-recovery may increase. See &#8220;Concerns about high rates for the Utility&#8217;s customers could negatively impact PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows&#8221; below. 
Events or conditions caused by climate change could have a material impact on the Utility&#8217;s operations and could result in lower revenues or increased expenses, or both. If the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility&#8217;s rates to reflect the impact of events or conditions caused by climate change, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
The Utility&#8217;s operations are subject to extensive environmental laws, and such laws could change. 
The Utility has been in the past, and may be in the future, required to pay for environmental remediation costs at sites where it is or may be identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws. These costs can be difficult to estimate due to uncertainties about the extent of contamination, emerging contaminants, remediation alternatives, the applicable remediation levels, and the financial ability of other potentially responsible parties, and the Utility&#8217;s recorded liabilities for known environmental obligations may not accurately estimate its losses. For more information, see Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 
Environmental remediation costs could increase in the future as a result of new legislation or regulation, the current trend toward more stringent standards, or stricter and more expansive application of existing environmental regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or failure to comply with the terms of licenses or permits issued by environmental or regulatory agencies, could expose the Utility to claims by third parties or the imposition of civil or criminal fines or other sanctions. 
The CPUC has authorized the Utility to recover its environmental remediation costs for certain sites through various ratemaking mechanisms. One of these mechanisms allows the Utility rate recovery for 90% of its hazardous substance remediation costs for certain approved sites without a reasonableness review. The CPUC may discontinue or change these ratemaking mechanisms in the future, or the Utility may incur environmental costs that exceed amounts the CPUC has authorized the Utility to recover through rates. 
Some of the Utility&#8217;s environmental costs, such as the remediation costs associated with the Hinkley natural gas compressor site, are not recoverable through rates or insurance. See &#8220;Environmental Regulation&#8221; in Item 1 and Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The Utility&#8217;s costs to remediate groundwater contamination near the Hinkley natural gas compressor site and to abate the effects of the contamination, changes in estimated costs, and the extent to which actual remediation costs differ from recorded liabilities have had, and may continue to have, a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
Risks Related to Other Enforcement Matters, Investigations, and Regulatory Proceedings 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are subject to the Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Process. 
The EOEP is a six-step process with potentially escalating CPUC oversight and enforcement measures based on specific &#8220;triggering events&#8221; identified for each of the six steps. If the Utility is placed into the EOEP, it will be subject to additional reporting requirements and additional monitoring and oversight by the CPUC. Higher steps of the process (steps 3 through 6) also contemplate additional enforcement mechanisms, including appointment of an independent third-party monitor, appointment of a chief restructuring officer, pursuit of the receivership remedy, and review of the Utility&#8217;s Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (i.e., its license to operate as a utility). The process contains provisions for the Utility to cure and exit the process if it can satisfy specific criteria. The EOEP states that the Utility should presumptively move through the steps of the process sequentially, but the CPUC may place the Utility into the appropriate step of the process upon occurrence of a specified triggering event. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility could incur significant costs to comply with laws and regulations and be adversely affected by legislative and regulatory developments. 
The Utility and its operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and orders. The Utility incurs significant capital, operating, and other costs associated with compliance with these rules. These rules could change, which could change the Utility&#8217;s compliance obligations and the costs to comply with these rules. Non-compliance with these rules could result in the imposition of material fines on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility, other regulatory exposure, significant litigation, and reputational harm, which could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
Wildfire 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected if the Wildfire Fund does not effectively mitigate the financial risk of liability for damages arising from catastrophic wildfires where the Utility&#8217;s facilities are a substantial cause. See &#8220;The Wildfire Fund and other provisions of AB 1054 may not effectively mitigate the risk of liability for damages arising from catastrophic wildfires.&#8221; above. 
Privacy 
In June 2018, the State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the &#8220;CCPA&#8221;), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, with a 12-month look-back period requiring compliance by January 1, 2019. The CCPA requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices, allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and provides a new cause of action for data breaches. The CCPA provides for financial penalties in the event of non-compliance and statutory damages in the event of a data security breach. On November 3, 2020, Californians voted to approve Proposition 24, a ballot measure that created the California Privacy Rights Act (the &#8220;CPRA&#8221;), which amended and expanded the CCPA. The State of California enacted the CPRA in November 2020, with most provisions operative as of January 1, 2023 and applicable to personal information collected beginning January 1, 2022. Final CPRA regulations are in development. Failure to comply with the CCPA and the CPRA could result in litigation, audits, and the imposition of material fines on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility. 
Additionally, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility collect and retain certain personal information of their customers, shareholders, and employees in connection with their business. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s risk management and information security measures may be ineffective, and the personal information that they collect, as well as other commercially-sensitive data that they possess, could become compromised because of certain events, including a cyber incident, the insufficiency or failure of such measures, human error, the misappropriation of data, or the occurrence of any of the foregoing at any third party with which PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility has shared information. If any of these events were to transpire, it could subject PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility to financial liability. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are subject to federal and state privacy laws, which grant consumers rights and protections, including, among other things, the ability to opt out of receiving certain communications and certain data sharing with third parties. 
Environmental 
The environmental rules to which the Utility&#8217;s operations are subject relate to air quality, water quality and usage, remediation of hazardous substances, and the protection and conservation of natural resources and wildlife. 
Also, SB 100 (the 100 Percent Clean Energy Act of 2018) increased the percentage from 50% to 60% of California&#8217;s electricity portfolio that must come from renewables by 2030; and established state policy that 100% of all retail electricity sales must come from renewable portfolio standard-eligible or carbon-free resources by 2045. Failure to comply with SB 100 could result in fines imposed on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility that could be material. 
The Utility develops its capital plans based on forecasts, including those around load growth, gas system planning, and transportation electrification, which assume that California continues to pursue consistent environmental policies. If the federal government withdraws its support for grid modernization or prohibits California from pursuing its environmental policies, or if California changes its policies, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility may be unable to meet their environmental and financial goals. 
The Utility is subject to extensive regulations and enforcement proceedings in connection with compliance with such regulations could result in penalties. 
The Utility is subject to extensive regulations, including federal, state, and local energy, environmental and other laws and regulations, and the risk of enforcement proceedings in connection with compliance with such regulations. The Utility could incur material charges, including fines and other penalties, in connection with matters that the CPUC&#8217;s SED may investigate. The SED can launch investigations at any time on any issue it deems appropriate. In addition, the OEIS has authority to approve and oversee compliance with the WMP and may determine that the Utility has failed to substantially comply with its WMP. 
The Utility could be subject to additional regulatory or governmental enforcement action in the future with respect to compliance with federal, state, or local laws, regulations or orders that could result in additional fines, penalties or customer refunds, including those regarding renewable energy and RA requirements; customer billing; customer service; affiliate transactions; vegetation management; design, construction, operating and maintenance practices; safety and inspection practices; compliance with CPUC GOs or other applicable CPUC decisions or regulations; whether the Utility is able to achieve the targets in its WMPs; federal electric reliability standards; and environmental compliance. CPUC staff could also impose penalties on the Utility in the future in accordance with its authority under the gas and electric safety citation programs. The amount of such fines, penalties, or customer refunds depends on a variety of factors and could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The Utility also is a target of a number of investigations, in addition to certain investigations in connection with the wildfires. See &#8220;Risks Related to Wildfires&#8221; above. The Utility is unable to predict the outcome of pending investigations, including whether any charges will be brought against the Utility, or the amount of any costs and expenses associated with such investigations. 
If these investigations result in enforcement action against the Utility, the Utility could incur additional fines or penalties, the amount of which could be substantial, and, in the event of a judgment against the Utility, suffer further ongoing negative consequences. Furthermore, a negative outcome in any of these investigations, or future enforcement actions, could negatively affect the outcome of future ratemaking and regulatory proceedings to which the Utility may be subject; for example, by enabling parties to challenge the Utility&#8217;s request to recover costs that the parties allege are somehow related to the Utility&#8217;s violations. 
The Utility&#8217;s ratemaking and cost recovery proceedings may not authorize sufficient revenues, or the Utility&#8217;s actual costs could exceed its authorized or forecasted costs due to various factors. 
The Utility&#8217;s financial results depend on its ability to earn a reasonable return on capital, including long-term debt and equity, and to recover costs from its customers, through the rates it charges its customers as approved by the CPUC and the FERC. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected if the CPUC or the FERC does not authorize sufficient revenues for the Utility or if the amount of actual costs incurred differs from the forecast or authorized costs embedded in rates. The outcome of the Utility&#8217;s ratemaking proceedings can be affected by many factors, including the level of opposition by intervening parties; potential rate impacts; increasing levels of regulatory review; changes in the political, regulatory, or legislative environments; and the opinions of the Utility&#8217;s regulators, consumer and other stakeholder organizations, and customers, about the Utility&#8217;s ability to provide safe, reliable, and affordable electric and gas services. If the CPUC does not authorize sufficient funding for investments in the Utility&#8217;s infrastructure, it may negatively impact the Utility&#8217;s ability to modernize the grid and make it resilient to risks related to climate change, including wildfires. 
In addition to the amount of authorized revenues, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected if the Utility&#8217;s actual costs differ from authorized or forecast costs. The Utility&#8217;s ability to recover its costs and earn a reasonable rate of return can be affected by many factors, including the time delay between when costs are incurred and when those costs are recovered through rates. The CPUC or the FERC may not allow the Utility to recover costs on the basis that such costs were not reasonably or prudently incurred or for other reasons. Further, the Utility may be required to incur expenses before the relevant regulatory agency approves the recovery of such costs. For example, the Utility has incurred, and continues to incur, costs to strengthen its wildfire mitigation and prevention efforts before it is clear whether such costs will be recoverable through rates. Also, the CPUC may deny recovery of uninsured wildfire-related costs incurred by the Utility if the CPUC determines that the Utility was not prudent. 
The Utility may incur additional costs or receive reduced revenue without cost recovery for many reasons including changing market circumstances, unanticipated events (such as wildfires, storms, earthquakes, accidents, or catastrophic or other events affecting the Utility&#8217;s operations), whether the CAISO wholesale electricity market continues to function effectively, or compliance with new state laws or policies. See &#8220;Trends in Market Demand and Competitive Conditions in the Electricity Industry&#8221; in Item 1. 
Jurisdictions may attempt to acquire the Utility&#8217;s assets through eminent domain, and third parties may attempt to acquire the Utility&#8217;s customers by bypassing the Utility&#8217;s electric infrastructure system. 
Jurisdictions may attempt to acquire the Utility&#8217;s assets through eminent domain (&#8220;municipalization&#8221;). In particular, the City and County of San Francisco (&#8220;San Francisco&#8221;) has submitted a petition with the CPUC seeking a valuation of the Utility&#8217;s electric assets in San Francisco and has expressed intent to acquire such assets. San Francisco would still need to, among other things, initiate and prevail in an eminent domain action in state court to acquire the Utility&#8217;s assets, but the Utility may not be successful in defending against such an action or related regulatory proceeding. If municipalization proceedings are permitted to move forward and are successful, the Utility would be entitled to receive the fair market value of the assets that are subject to the takeover effort, as well as associated severance damages, but valuation issues in any municipalization proceeding would be highly contentious and could result in the Utility receiving less than what it believes is just compensation for the applicable assets. Any assets acquired by a third party through eminent domain would be excluded from the Utility&#8217;s rate base, reducing the Utility&#8217;s revenues and opportunity to earn a return on such assets. In addition, third parties may attempt to bypass the Utility&#8217;s existing electric infrastructure system to provide retail electric service to discrete geographic areas or specific customers. Utility assets that are targeted for municipalization, as well as existing or potential future Utility customers targeted for electric services by third parties that bypass the Utility&#8217;s facilities, generally are located in geographic areas that have a lower cost of service relative to billed revenues, so municipalization (or bypass) could negatively impact the affordability of the Utility&#8217;s service for remaining Utility customers served outside of those geographic areas. A successful municipalization or bypass attempt could also encourage similar attempts by other municipalities or third parties which, if successful, would further divide the Utility&#8217;s assets and reduce the Utility&#8217;s rate base, profitability, and affordability for remaining Utility customers. It is also unclear how the CPUC would allocate the compensation received by the Utility for any involuntary sale of its assets between shareholders and customers. As a result of these factors, municipalization or electric bypass could materially affect the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flow. 
Risks Related to PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s Environment and Financial Condition 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s substantial indebtedness may adversely affect their financial health and operating flexibility. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have a substantial amount of indebtedness, most of which is secured by liens on certain assets of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility. As of December 31, 2023, PG&#38;E Corporation had approximately $4.65 billion of outstanding indebtedness (such indebtedness consisting of PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s $2.15 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior secured notes due 2027, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2028, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2030, and $500 million of borrowings under the secured term loan agreement entered into in June 2020), and the Utility had approximately $48.0 billion of outstanding indebtedness. In addition, PG&#38;E Corporation had $500 million of additional borrowing capacity under the Corporation Revolving Credit Agreement, and the Utility had $2.0 billion of additional borrowing capacity under the Utility Revolving Credit Agreement. In addition, the Utility had outstanding preferred stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of $252 million. 
Since PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have a high level of debt, a substantial portion of cash flow from operations will be used to make payments on this debt. Furthermore, since a significant percentage of the Utility&#8217;s assets are used to secure its debt, this reduces the amount of collateral available for future secured debt or credit support and reduces its flexibility in operating these secured assets or using them for other financing transactions. This relatively high level of debt and related security could have other important consequences for PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility, including: 
Under the terms of the agreements and indentures governing their respective indebtedness, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are permitted to incur additional indebtedness, some of which could be secured (subject to compliance with certain tests) and which could further accentuate these risks. As a result of the high level of indebtedness, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility may be unable to generate sufficient cash through operations to service such debt, and may need to refinance such indebtedness at or prior to maturity and be unable to obtain financing on suitable terms or at all. As a capital-intensive company, the Utility relies on access to the capital markets, particularly investment grade capital markets. If the Utility were unable to access the capital markets or the cost of financing were to substantially increase, its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. Although the Utility is generally entitled to seek recovery of its cost of capital, because such requests are subject to CPUC review, the Utility may not successfully recover its cost of capital. Even when cost recovery is granted, the timing of such recovery will generally not occur until after the costs are required to be paid. The Utility&#8217;s ability to obtain financing, as well as its ability to refinance debt and make scheduled payments of principal and interest, are dependent on numerous factors, including the Utility&#8217;s levels of indebtedness, maintenance of acceptable credit ratings, financial performance, liquidity and cash flow, and other market conditions. The Utility&#8217;s inability to service its substantial debt or access the financial markets on reasonable terms could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The documents that govern PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s indebtedness limit their flexibility in operating their business. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s material financing agreements, including certain of their respective credit agreements and indentures, contain various covenants restricting, among other things, their ability to: 
The restrictions contained in these material financing agreements could affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to operate their business and may limit their ability to react to market conditions or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. For example, such restrictions could adversely affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to finance their operations and expenditures, make strategic acquisitions, investments, or alliances, sell assets, restructure their organization, or finance their capital needs. Additionally, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond their control, including prevailing regulatory, economic, financial and industry conditions. 
PG&#38;E Corporation may be required to issue shares with respect to HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims, which would result in dilution to holders of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock, or pay a material amount of cash with respect to allowed Subordinated Debt Claims. 
On the Emergence Date, PG&#38;E Corporation issued to the Fire Victim Trust a number of shares of common stock equal to 22.19% of the outstanding common stock on such date. As further described in &#8220;Wildfire-Related Securities Claims&#8212;Claims in the Bankruptcy Court Process&#8221; in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, PG&#38;E Corporation may be required to issue shares of its common stock in satisfaction of allowed HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims. If such issuance is required, it may be determined that, under the Plan, the Fire Victim Trust should receive additional shares of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock such that it would have owned 22.19% of the outstanding common stock of reorganized PG&#38;E Corporation on the Emergence Date, assuming that such issuance of shares in satisfaction of the HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims had occurred on the Emergence Date. Any such issuances will result in dilution to anyone who holds shares of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock prior to such issuance and may cause the trading price of PG&#38;E Corporation shares to decline. 
Additionally, PG&#38;E Corporation may be required to pay a material amount of cash with respect to allowed Subordinated Debt Claims (as defined in &#8220;Wildfire-Related Securities Claims &#8212; Claims in the Bankruptcy Court Process&#8221; in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8). Such payment may have a material adverse impact on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
PG&#38;E Corporation common stock is subject to ownership and transfer restrictions intended to preserve PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes. 
PG&#38;E Corporation has incurred and may also incur in the future significant net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes, the amount and availability of which are subject to certain qualifications, limitations and uncertainties. The Amended Articles (as defined below) impose certain restrictions on the transferability and ownership of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock and preferred stock (together, the &#8220;capital stock&#8221;) and other interests designated as &#8220;stock&#8221; of PG&#38;E Corporation by the Board of Directors as disclosed in an SEC filing (such stock and other interests, the &#8220;Equity Securities,&#8221; and such restrictions on transferability and ownership, the &#8220;Ownership Restrictions&#8221;) in order to reduce the possibility of an equity ownership shift that could result in limitations on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes from prior taxable years or periods for federal income tax purposes. Any acquisition of PG&#38;E Corporation capital stock that results in a shareholder being in violation of these restrictions may not be valid. 
Subject to certain exceptions, the Ownership Restrictions restrict (i) any person or entity (including certain groups of persons) from directly or indirectly acquiring or accumulating 4.75% or more of the outstanding Equity Securities and (ii) the ability of any person or entity (including certain groups of persons) already owning, directly or indirectly, 4.75% or more of the Equity Securities to increase their proportionate interest in the Equity Securities. Additionally, the application of the Ownership Restrictions, as defined in PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s Amended Articles of Incorporation, will be determined on the basis of a number of shares outstanding that differs materially from the number of shares reported as outstanding on the cover page of its periodic reports under the Exchange Act because it excludes shares owned by the Utility. See &#8220;Tax Matters&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A for an example of these calculations. Any transferee receiving Equity Securities that would result in a violation of the Ownership Restrictions will not be recognized as a shareholder of PG&#38;E Corporation or entitled to any rights of shareholders, including, without limitation, the right to vote and to receive dividends or distributions, whether liquidating or otherwise, in each case, with respect to the Equity Securities causing the violation. 
The Ownership Restrictions remain in effect until the earliest of (i) the repeal, amendment, or modification of Section 382 (and any comparable successor provision) of the IRC, in a manner that renders the restrictions imposed by Section 382 of the IRC no longer applicable to PG&#38;E Corporation, (ii) the beginning of a taxable year in which the Board of Directors of PG&#38;E Corporation determines that no tax benefits attributable to net operating losses or other tax attributes are available, (iii) the date selected by the Board of Directors if it determines that the limitation amount imposed by Section 382 of the IRC as of such date in the event of an &#8220;ownership change&#8221; of PG&#38;E Corporation (as defined in Section 382 of the IRC and Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1502-91 et seq.) would not be materially less than the net operating loss carryforwards or &#8220;net unrealized built-in loss&#8221; (within the meaning of Section 382 of the IRC and Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1502-91 et seq.) of PG&#38;E Corporation, and (iv) the date selected by the Board of Directors if it determines that it is in the best interests of PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s shareholders for the Ownership Restrictions to be removed or released. The Ownership Restrictions may also be waived by the Board of Directors on a case by case basis. 
PG&#38;E Corporation may not be able to use some or all of its net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to 
offset future income. 
As of December 31, 2023, PG&#38;E Corporation had net operating loss carryforwards for PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s consolidated group for U.S. federal and California income tax purposes of approximately $32.9 billion and $32.6 billion, respectively, and PG&#38;E Corporation incurred and may also continue to incur significant net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes. The ability of PG&#38;E Corporation to use some or all of these net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be subject to certain limitations. Under Section 382 of the IRC (which also applies for California state income tax purposes), if a corporation (or a consolidated group) undergoes an &#8220;ownership change,&#8221; such net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may be subject to certain limitations. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain shareholders (generally five percent shareholders, applying certain look-through and aggregation rules) increases by more than 50% over such shareholders&#8217; lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years). 
As of the date of this report, it is more likely than not that PG&#38;E Corporation has not undergone an ownership change and its net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes are not limited by Section 382 of the IRC. However, whether PG&#38;E Corporation underwent an ownership change as a result of the transactions in PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s equity that occurred pursuant to the Plan or in combination with other changes in the ownership of PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s equity depends on several factors outside PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s control and the application of certain laws that are uncertain in several respects. Accordingly, the IRS may successfully assert that PG&#38;E Corporation has undergone an ownership change pursuant to the Plan. If the IRS successfully asserts that PG&#38;E Corporation did undergo, or PG&#38;E Corporation otherwise does undergo, an ownership change, the limitation on its net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes under Section 382 of the IRC could be material to PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
In particular, limitations imposed on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes could cause U.S. federal and California income taxes to be paid earlier than would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes. Further, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards is critical to PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s commitment to make certain operating and capital expenditures. Failure to obtain alternative sources of capital could have a material adverse effect on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility and the value of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock. 
PG&#38;E Corporation is a holding company and relies on dividends, distributions and other payments, advances, and transfers of funds from the Utility to meet its obligations. 
PG&#38;E Corporation conducts its operations primarily through its subsidiary, the Utility, and substantially all of PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s consolidated assets are held by the Utility. Accordingly, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s cash flow and its ability to meet its debt service obligations under its existing and future indebtedness are largely dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of the Utility and the distribution or other payment of these earnings and cash flows to PG&#38;E Corporation in the form of dividends or loans or advances and repayment of loans and advances from the Utility. The ability of the Utility to pay dividends or make other advances, distributions, and transfers of funds will depend on its results of operations and may be restricted by, among other things, applicable laws limiting the amount of funds available for payment of dividends and certain restrictive covenants contained in the agreements of those subsidiaries. Additionally, the Utility must use its resources to satisfy its own obligations, including its obligation to serve customers, to pay principal and interest on outstanding debt, to pay preferred stock dividends, and to meet its obligations to employees and creditors, before it can distribute cash to PG&#38;E Corporation. In addition, the CPUC has imposed various conditions that govern the relationship between PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility, including financial conditions that require the Board of Directors to give first priority to the capital requirements of the Utility, as determined to be necessary and prudent to meet the Utility&#8217;s obligation to serve or to operate the Utility in a prudent and efficient manner. The deterioration of income from, or other available assets of, the Utility for any reason could limit or impair the Utility&#8217;s ability to pay dividends or other distributions to PG&#38;E Corporation, which could, in turn, materially and adversely affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s ability to meet its obligations. 
California law and certain provisions in the Amended Articles and the amended and restated bylaws of PG&#38;E Corporation (the &#8220;Amended Bylaws&#8221;) may prevent efforts by shareholders to change the direction or management of PG&#38;E Corporation. 
The Amended Articles and the Amended Bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of PG&#38;E Corporation more difficult without the approval of the Board of Directors, including the following: 
These and other provisions in the Amended Articles, the Amended Bylaws, and California law could make it more difficult for shareholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of the Board of Directors or initiate actions that are opposed by the then-current Board of Directors, including delaying or impeding merger, tender offer, or proxy contest involving PG&#38;E Corporation. The existence of these provisions could negatively affect the price of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock and limit opportunities for shareholders to realize value in a corporate transaction. 
The Utility may be unable to manage its costs effectively. 
The Utility has set a goal to increase its capital investments to meet safety and climate goals, while also achieving operating cost savings. The Utility&#8217;s ability to achieve such savings depends, in part, on whether the Utility can improve the planning and execution of its work by continuing to implement the Lean operating system. Even if the Utility is able to reduce some costs, other emerging priorities, such as emergency response, public purpose programs, wildfire mitigation initiatives, or California&#8217;s clean energy transition, could require it to reinvest those savings. 
Concerns about high rates for the Utility&#8217;s customers could negatively impact PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The rates paid by the Utility&#8217;s customers are impacted by the Utility&#8217;s costs, commodity prices, and broader energy trends. The Utility&#8217;s capital investment plan, increasing procurement of renewable power and energy storage, increasing environmental regulations, leveling demand, and the cumulative impact of other public policy requirements, collectively place continuing upward pressure on customers&#8217; rates. In particular, the Utility will need to make substantial, sustained investments to its infrastructure to adapt to climate change, enable the clean energy transition, and mitigate wildfire risk. For more information on factors that could cause the Utility&#8217;s costs to increase, see &#8220;The Utility&#8217;s ratemaking and cost recovery proceedings may not authorize sufficient revenues, or the Utility&#8217;s actual costs could exceed its authorized or forecasted costs due to various factors&#8221; above. The CPUC considers affordability as it adjudicates the Utility&#8217;s rate cases, and concerns about affordability could cause the CPUC to approve lesser amounts in the Utility&#8217;s ratemaking or cost recovery proceedings. 
The Utility generally recovers its electricity and natural gas procurement costs through rates as &#8220;pass-through&#8221; costs. Increases in the Utility&#8217;s commodity costs directly impact customer bills. 
Increasing levels of self-generation of electricity by customers (primarily solar installations) and customer enrollment in NEM and NBT, which allows self-generating customers to receive bill credits for power exported to the grid, shifts costs to other customers. Under this structure, NEM and NBT customers do not pay their proportionate share of the cost of maintaining and operating the electric transmission and distribution system, including costs associated with funding social equity programs, subject to certain exceptions, while still receiving electricity from the system when their self-generation is inadequate to meet their electricity needs. These unpaid costs are subsidized by customers not participating in NEM or NBT. Accordingly, as more electric customers switch to the NBT and self-generate energy, the burden on the remaining customers increases, which in turn encourages more self-generation, further increasing rate pressure on existing non-NEM or non-NBT customers. 
Other long-term trends could also increase costs for gas customers. Natural gas suppliers are subject to compliance with CARB&#8217;s cap-and-trade program, and natural gas end-use customers have an increasing exposure to carbon costs under the program through 2030 (when the full cost will be reflected in customer bills). Increased renewable portfolio standards in the electric sector could also reduce electric generation gas load. CARB may also require aggressive energy efficiency programs to reduce natural gas end use consumption. Additionally, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District has adopted rules that restrict the sale of gas space and water heating appliances, and the CARB is considering similar rules. If other jurisdictions also adopt similar rules, reduced gas demand could accelerate customers replacing natural gas appliances with electric appliances. The combination of reduced load and increased costs to maintain the gas system could result in higher natural gas customer bills. In addition, some local city governments have passed ordinances restricting use of natural gas in new construction and, if other jurisdictions follow suit, this could affect future demand for the provision of natural gas. If fewer customers receive gas from the Utility, the Utility&#8217;s gas system maintenance costs, many of which cannot be reduced in the short term even if gas quantities decrease, would be borne by fewer customers. Finally, a mandate to purchase renewable natural gas for core customers could lead to increased costs for core customers if utilities are competing with the transportation sector for supplies of renewable natural gas. 
A confluence of technology-related cost declines, along with sustained or increased federal or state subsidies, could make a combination of distributed generation and energy storage a viable, cost-effective alternative to the Utility&#8217;s bundled electric service which could further reduce energy demand. Reduced energy demand or significantly slowed growth in demand due to customer migration to other energy providers, adoption of energy efficient technology, conservation, increasing levels of distributed generation and self-generation, unless substantially offset through regulatory cost allocations, could increase the energy rates for other customers. 
If rates were to rise too rapidly, customer usage or the number of customers could decline. A decrease in the volume of sales, among which the Utility&#8217;s costs are allocated, could further increase rates. 
To relieve some of this upward rate pressure, the CPUC may authorize lower revenues than the Utility requested or increase the period over which the Utility is allowed to recover amounts, which could impact the Utility&#8217;s ability to timely recover its operating costs. The Utility&#8217;s level of authorized capital investment could decline as well, leading to fewer new business interconnections and a slower growth in rate base and earnings. As a result, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
Inflation and supply chain issues may adversely affect PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have observed that prices for equipment, materials, supplies, employee labor, contractor services, and variable-rate debt have increased and may continue to increase more quickly than expected as a result of inflation. Additionally, the Utility has experienced shortages in certain items, longer lead times, and delivery delays as a result of domestic and international raw material and labor shortages. If these disruptions to the supply chain persist or worsen, the Utility may be delayed or prevented from completing planned maintenance and capital projects work. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility may be unable to secure these resources on economically acceptable terms or offset such costs with increased revenues, operating efficiencies, or cost savings, which may adversely affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.

PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results can be affected by many factors, including estimates and assumptions used in the critical accounting estimates described in Item 7. MD&#38;A, that can cause their actual financial results to differ materially from historical results or from anticipated future financial results. The following discussion of key risk factors should be considered in evaluating an investment in PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility and should be read in conjunction with Item 7. MD&#38;A and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this 2022 Form 10-K. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
Risk Factors Summary 
The following is a summary of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, operations, and financial results. These risks are discussed more fully below. 
Risks related to wildfires, including risks related to: 
Risks related to operations and information technology, including risks related to: 
Risks related to environmental factors, including risks related to: 
Risks related to enforcement matters, investigations, and regulatory proceedings, including risks related to: 
Risks related to financial conditions, including risks related to: 
Risks Related to Wildfires 
The Wildfire Fund and other provisions of AB 1054 may not effectively mitigate the risk of liability for damages arising from catastrophic wildfires. 
If the Utility does not have an approved WMP, the Utility will not be issued a safety certification and will consequently not benefit from the presumption of prudency or the AB 1054 disallowance cap. Under AB 1054, the Utility is required to maintain a safety certification issued by the OEIS to be eligible for certain benefits, including a cap on Wildfire Fund reimbursement and a reformed prudent manager standard. The AB 1054 Wildfire Fund disallowance cap, which caps the amount of liability that the Utility could be required to bear for a catastrophic wildfire, is inapplicable if the Wildfire Fund administrator determines that the electric utility company&#8217;s actions or inactions that resulted in the applicable wildfire constituted &#8220;conscious or willful disregard for the rights and safety of others,&#8221; or the electric utility company fails to maintain a valid safety certification at the time the applicable wildfire ignited. In addition, if the Utility fails to maintain a valid safety certification at the time a wildfire ignites, the initial burden of proof in a prudency proceeding shifts from intervenors to the Utility. The Utility will be required to reimburse amounts that are determined by the CPUC not to be just and reasonable. For more information on the disallowance cap, see Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 
Furthermore, the Wildfire Fund will only be available for payment of eligible claims so long as there are sufficient funds remaining in the Wildfire Fund. Such funds could be depleted more quickly than expected, including as a result of claims made by California&#8217;s other participating electric utility companies. If the Utility is unable to maintain an AB 1054 safety certification or if the Wildfire Fund is exhausted, the inability to access the Wildfire Fund could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. Also, the Utility will not be able to obtain any recovery from the Wildfire Fund for wildfire-related losses in any year that do not exceed the greater of $1.0 billion in the aggregate and the amount of insurance coverage required under AB 1054. 
The costs of participating in the Wildfire Fund are expected to exceed $6.7 billion over the anticipated ten-year contribution period for the fund. The timing and amount of any potential charges associated with the Utility&#8217;s contributions would also depend on various factors. In addition, there could also be a significant delay between the occurrence of a wildfire and the timing on which the Utility recognizes impairment for the reduction in future coverage, due to the lack of data available to the Utility following a catastrophic event, especially if the wildfire occurs in the service area of another participating electric utility. Participation in the Wildfire Fund is expected to have a material impact on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows, and there can be no assurance that the benefits of participating in the Wildfire Fund ultimately outweigh these substantial costs. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility could be liable as a result of the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, the 2022 Mosquito fire, or future wildfires. 
Based on the facts and circumstances available as of the date of this report, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have determined that it is probable they will incur losses in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, and the 2022 Mosquito fire. Although PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have recorded liabilities for probable losses in connection with these fires, these liability estimates correspond to the lower end of the range of reasonably estimable losses, do not include several categories of potential damages that are not reasonably estimable, and are subject to change based on new information. 
Although there are a number of unknown facts surrounding Cal Fire&#8217;s causation determinations of the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, and the 2022 Mosquito fire, the Utility could be subject to significant liability in excess of recoveries that would be expected to have a material impact on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have also received and have responded or are responding to document, data, and other information requests from the CPUC&#8217;s SED, the DOJ, and law enforcement agencies that are investigating these wildfires. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility could be the subject of additional investigations, lawsuits, or enforcement actions in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, the 2022 Mosquito fire, or other wildfires. For more information, see Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 
Criminal charges have been filed against the Utility in connection with the 2020 Zogg fire. Under California law (including Penal Code section 1202.4), if the Utility were convicted of any of the charges, the sentencing court must order the Utility to &#8220;make restitution to the victim or victims in an amount established by court order&#8221; that is &#8220;sufficient to fully reimburse the victim or victims for every determined economic loss incurred as the result of&#8221; the Utility&#8217;s underlying conduct, in addition to interest and the victim&#8217;s or victims&#8217; attorneys&#8217; fees. This requirement for full reimbursement of economic loss is not waivable by either the government or the victims and is not offset by any compensation that the victims have received or may receive from their insurance carriers. If convicted of any of the charges, the Utility currently believes that its total losses associated with the 2020 Zogg fire could materially exceed the accrued estimated liabilities that PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have recorded to reflect the lower end of the range of the reasonably estimable range of losses. The Utility is unable to determine a reasonable estimate of the amount of such additional losses. The Utility does not expect that any of its liability insurance would be available to cover restitution payments ordered by the court presiding over the criminal proceeding. 
There have been numerous other wildfires in the Utility&#8217;s service area, of which the Utility has not been alleged or determined to be a cause. The Utility could be alleged or determined to be a cause of one or more of these wildfires. 
Additionally, under the doctrine of inverse condemnation, courts have imposed liability against utilities on the grounds that losses borne by the person whose property was damaged through a public-use undertaking should be spread across the community that benefited from such undertaking, even if the utility is unable to recover these costs through rates. In fact, in December 2017, the CPUC denied recovery of costs that San Diego Gas &#38; Electric Company stated it had incurred as a result of the doctrine of inverse condemnation. Legal challenges to that denial were unsuccessful. Plaintiffs have asserted and continue to assert the doctrine of inverse condemnation in lawsuits related to certain wildfires that occurred in the Utility&#8217;s service area. Inverse condemnation imposes strict liability (including liability for attorneys&#8217; fees) for damages as a result of the design, construction and maintenance of utility facilities, including utilities&#8217; electric transmission lines. While the Utility continues to dispute the applicability of inverse condemnation to the Utility, there can be no assurance that the Utility will be successful in challenging the applicability of inverse condemnation in the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, the 2022 Mosquito fire, or other litigation against PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility. 
Although the Utility has taken extensive measures to reduce the threat of future wildfires, the potential that the Utility&#8217;s equipment will be involved in the ignition of future wildfires, including catastrophic wildfires, is significant. This risk may be attributable to, and exacerbated by, a variety of factors, including climate (in particular, extended periods of seasonal dryness coupled with periods of high wind velocities and other storms), infrastructure, and vegetation conditions. Despite significant investment in mitigation measures to improve infrastructure and manage vegetation, as well as implementation of de-energization strategies, the Utility may not be successful in mitigating the risk of future wildfires. Once an ignition has occurred, the Utility is unable to control the extent of damages. The extent of damages for a wildfire is primarily determined by environmental conditions (including weather and vegetation conditions), third-party suppression efforts, and the location of the wildfire. 
In addition, wildfires have had and could continue to have (as a result of any future wildfires) adverse consequences on the Utility&#8217;s proceedings with the CPUC (including the Safety Culture OII) and the FERC, and future regulatory proceedings, including future applications with the OEIS for the safety certification required by AB 1054. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility may also suffer additional reputational harm and face an even more challenging operating, political, and regulatory environment as a result of the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, the 2022 Mosquito fire, or any future wildfires. For more information about the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, and the 2022 Mosquito fire, see Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 
The Utility may be unable to recover all or a significant portion of its costs in excess of insurance coverage in connection with wildfires, through rates, or from the Wildfire Fund in a timely manner. 
The Utility could incur substantial costs in excess of insurance coverage or amounts potentially available under the Wildfire Fund under AB 1054 in the future in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, and the 2022 Mosquito fire. There can be no assurance that the Utility will be allowed to recover costs in excess of insurance or amounts potentially available under the Wildfire Fund under AB 1054 in the future either through FERC TO rates or as costs recorded to the WEMA, even if a court decision were to determine that the Utility is liable as a result of the application of the doctrine of inverse condemnation. The inability to recover all or a significant portion of costs in excess of insurance through rates or by collecting such rates in a timely manner could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. For more information on wildfire recovery risk, see &#8220;The Wildfire Fund and other provisions of AB 1054 may not effectively mitigate the risk of liability for damages arising from catastrophic wildfires&#8221; above and Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 
The Utility may not effectively implement its wildfire mitigation initiatives. 
The Utility&#8217;s infrastructure is aging and poses risks to safety and system reliability. Although the Utility spends significant resources on initiatives designed to mitigate wildfire risks, there is no assurance that these initiatives will be successful or effective in reducing wildfire-related losses. The Utility will face a higher likelihood of catastrophic wildfires in its service area if it cannot effectively implement these efforts and its WMPs. For example, the Utility may not be able to effectively implement its WMPs if it experiences unanticipated difficulties relative to sourcing, engaging, training, overseeing, and retaining contract workers it needs to fulfill its mitigation obligations under the WMPs. The CPUC will assess penalties on the Utility if there is a finding that the Utility has failed to substantially comply with its WMPs. 
There can be no assurance that the Utility&#8217;s wildfire mitigation initiatives will be effective. For instance, a wildfire may be ignited and spread even in conditions that do not trigger proactive de-energization according to criteria for initiating a PSPS event or where EPSS has been implemented on Utility equipment. The Utility&#8217;s inspections of vegetation near its assets may not detect structural weaknesses within a tree or other issues. If the Utility&#8217;s wildfire mitigation initiatives are not effective, a wildfire could be ignited and spread. 
The PSPS program has been subject to significant scrutiny and criticism by various stakeholders, including customers, regulators, and lawmakers. The Utility also is the subject of a class action litigation in connection with the 2019 PSPS events. 
In addition, on a risk-informed basis, the Utility is making efforts to reduce the frequency and impacts of PSPS. The Utility may be subject to mandated changes to, or restrictions on, its operational practices, regulatory fines and penalties, claims for damages, and reputational harm if the Utility does not execute PSPS in compliance with applicable rules and regulations. The Utility establishes the criteria under which it implements PSPS in its territory. To the extent the Utility&#8217;s criteria for implementing PSPS are not sufficient to mitigate the risk of wildfires, the Utility does not fully implement PSPS when criteria are met due to other overriding conditions or the Utility&#8217;s regulators mandate changes to, or restrictions on, its criteria or other operational PSPS practices, the Utility will face a higher likelihood of catastrophic wildfires in its territory during high-risk weather conditions. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility cannot predict the timing and outcome of the various proceedings and litigation in connection with its wildfire mitigation initiatives. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility could be subject to additional investigations, regulatory proceedings, or other enforcement actions as well as to additional litigation and claims by customers as a result of the Utility&#8217;s implementation of its wildfire mitigation initiatives, which could result in fines, penalties, customer rebates, other payments, or the Utility&#8217;s failure to obtain cost recovery for amounts expended on these initiatives. The amount of any fines, penalties, customer rebates or other payments (if PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility were to issue any credits, rebates or other payments in connection with any other wildfire mitigation initiatives or liability for damages) could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. In addition, the PSPS and EPSS programs have had an adverse impact on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s reputation with customers, regulators and policymakers and future PSPS events and EPSS outages may increase these negative perceptions. For more information, see &#8220;Regulatory Matters&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A. 
Risks Related to Operations and Information Technology 
The Utility&#8217;s electricity and natural gas operations are inherently hazardous and involve significant risks. 
The Utility owns and operates extensive electricity and natural gas facilities, including two nuclear generation units and an extensive hydroelectric generating system. See &#8220;Electric Utility Operations&#8221; and &#8220;Natural Gas Utility Operations&#8221; in Item 1. above. The Utility undertakes substantial capital investment projects to construct, replace, and improve its electricity and natural gas facilities. In addition, the Utility is obligated to decommission its electricity generation facilities at the end of their useful operating lives. For more information, see &#8220;The operation and decommissioning of the Utility&#8217;s nuclear generation facilities expose it to potentially significant liabilities and the Utility may not be able to fully recover its costs if regulatory requirements or operating conditions change or the facilities cease operations before the licenses expire&#8221; below. 
The Utility&#8217;s ability to efficiently construct, maintain, operate, protect, and decommission its facilities, and provide electricity and natural gas services safely and reliably is subject to numerous risks, many of which are beyond the Utility&#8217;s control, including those that arise from: 
The occurrence of any of these events could interrupt fuel supplies, affect demand for electricity or natural gas, cause unplanned outages or reduce generating output, damage the Utility&#8217;s assets or operations, damage the assets or operations of third parties on which the Utility relies, damage property owned by customers or others, and cause personal injury or death. As a result, the Utility could incur costs to purchase replacement power, to repair assets and restore service, and to compensate third parties. Any such incidents also could lead to significant claims against the Utility. 
Further, the Utility often enters into agreements for third-party contractors to perform work, such as patrolling and inspection of facilities, vegetation management, or the construction or demolition or facilities, and the Utility may have less control over contractors than its employees. The Utility may retain liability for the quality and completion of the contractor&#8217;s work and can be subject to penalties or other enforcement action if the contractor violates applicable laws, rules, regulations, or orders. The Utility may also be subject to liability, penalties or other enforcement action as a result of personal injury or death caused by third-party contractor actions or inactions. 
Insurance, equipment warranties, or other contractual indemnification requirements may not be sufficient or effective to provide full or even partial recovery under all circumstances or against all hazards or liabilities to which the Utility may become subject. An uninsured loss could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The electric power and gas industries are undergoing significant changes driven by technological advancements and a decarbonized economy. 
The electric power industry is undergoing transformative change driven by technological advancements enabling customer choice and state climate policy supporting a decarbonized economy. California utilities also are experiencing increasing deployment by customers and third parties of distributed energy resources, such as on-site solar generation, electric vehicles, energy storage, fuel cells, energy efficiency, and demand response technologies. These developments will require sustained investments in grid modernization, renewable integration projects, energy efficiency programs, energy storage options, electric vehicle infrastructure and state infrastructure modernization (e.g., rail and water projects). The Utility may be unable to effectively adapt to these potential business and regulatory changes, for instance by failing to meet customer demand for new business interconnections in a timely manner. The CPUC is also conducting proceedings to evaluate changes to the planning and operation of the electric distribution grid in order to prepare for higher penetration of distributed energy resources and consider future grid modernization and grid reinforcement investments; evaluate if traditional grid investments can be deferred by distributed energy resources, and if feasible, what, if any, compensation to utilities would be appropriate for enabling those investments; and clarify the role of the electric distribution grid operator. If the Utility is unable to effectively adapt to these potential business and regulatory changes its business model and its ability to execute on its strategy could be materially impacted. 
Various jurisdictions within California have enacted prohibitions or restrictions on use and consumption of natural gas, for example in buildings, that will reduce the use of natural gas. Reducing natural gas use could lead to a reduction in the gas customer base and a diminished need for gas infrastructure and, as a result, could lead to certain gas assets no longer being &#8220;used and useful,&#8221; potentially causing substantial investment value of gas assets to be stranded (under CPUC precedent, when an asset no longer meets the standard of &#8220;used and useful,&#8221; the asset is removed from rate base, which results in a reduction in associated rate recovery). However, while natural gas demand is projected to decline over time, the costs of operating a safe and reliable gas delivery system in California have been increasing, among other things, to cover the cost of long-term pipeline safety enhancements. Inability by the Utility to recover through rates its investments into the natural gas system while still ensuring gas system safety and reliability could materially affect the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
These industry changes, costs associated with complying with new regulatory developments and initiatives and with technological advancements, or the Utility&#8217;s inability to successfully adapt to changes in the electric and gas industry, could materially affect the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The Utility&#8217;s operational networks and information technology systems could be impacted by a cyber incident, cyber security breach, severe natural event, or physical attack. 
The Utility&#8217;s electricity and natural gas systems rely on a complex, interconnected network of generation, transmission, distribution, control, and communication technologies, which can be damaged by natural events-such as severe weather or seismic events-and by malicious events, such as cyber and physical attacks. Private and public entities, such as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and the U.S. federal government, including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Energy, and the White House, have noted that cyber-attacks targeting utility systems are increasing in sophistication, magnitude, and frequency. The Utility&#8217;s operational networks also may face new cyber security risks due to modernizing and interconnecting the existing infrastructure with new technologies and control systems. Any failure or decrease in the functionality of the Utility&#8217;s operational networks could cause harm to the public or employees, significantly disrupt operations, negatively impact the Utility&#8217;s ability to safely generate, transport, deliver and store energy and gas or otherwise operate in the most safe and efficient manner or at all, and damage the Utility&#8217;s assets or operations or those of third parties. 
The Utility also relies on complex information technology systems that allow it to create, collect, use, disclose, store and otherwise process sensitive information, including the Utility&#8217;s financial information, customer energy usage and billing information, and personal information regarding customers, employees and their dependents, contractors, and other individuals. The Utility often relies on third-party vendors to host, maintain, modify, and update its systems, and to provide other services to the Utility or the Utility&#8217;s customers. In addition, the Utility is increasingly being required to disclose large amounts of data (including customer energy usage and personal information regarding customers) to support changes to California&#8217;s electricity market related to grid modernization and customer choice. These third-party vendors could cease to exist, fail to establish adequate processes to protect the Utility&#8217;s systems and information, or experience security incidents or inadequate security measures. Any incidents or disruptions in the Utility&#8217;s information technology systems could impact the Utility&#8217;s ability to track or collect revenues and to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting. 
The Utility and its third-party vendors have been subject to, and will likely continue to be subject to, breaches and attempts to gain unauthorized access to the Utility&#8217;s information technology systems or confidential data (including information about customers and employees), or to disrupt the Utility&#8217;s operations. None of these breaches or attempts has individually or in the aggregate resulted in a security incident with a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. Despite implementation of security and control measures, there can be no assurance that the Utility will be able to prevent unauthorized access to its operational networks, information technology systems or data, or the disruption of its operations. Such events could subject the Utility to significant expenses, claims by customers or third parties, government inquiries, penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, investigations, and regulatory actions that could result in material fines and penalties, loss of customers and harm to PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s reputation, any of which could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The Utility maintains cyber liability insurance that covers certain damages caused by cyber incidents. However, there is no assurance that adequate insurance will continue to be available at rates the Utility believes are reasonable or that the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident will be covered by insurance or recoverable through rates. 
The operation and decommissioning of the Utility&#8217;s nuclear generation facilities expose it to potentially significant liabilities, and the Utility may not be able to fully recover its costs if regulatory requirements or operating conditions change or the facilities cease operations before the licenses expire. 
The operation of the Utility&#8217;s nuclear generation facilities exposes it to potentially significant liabilities from environmental, health, and financial risks, such as risks relating to operation of the Diablo Canyon nuclear generation units as well as the storage, handling, and disposal of spent nuclear fuel, and the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity, natural disaster, or terrorist act. If the Utility incurs losses that are either not covered by insurance or exceed the amount of insurance coverage available, such losses could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. In addition, the Utility may be required under federal law to pay up to $275 million of liabilities arising out of each nuclear incident occurring not only at the Utility&#8217;s Diablo Canyon facility but at any other nuclear power plant in the United States. 
The Utility continues to face public concern about the safety of nuclear generation and nuclear fuel. Some of these nuclear opposition groups regularly file petitions at the NRC and in other forums challenging the actions of the NRC and urging governmental entities to adopt laws or policies in opposition to nuclear power. Although an action in opposition may ultimately fail, regulatory proceedings may take longer to conclude and be more costly to complete. It is also possible that public pressure could grow leading to adverse changes in legislation, regulations, orders, or their interpretation. As a result, operations at the Utility&#8217;s two nuclear generation units at Diablo Canyon could cease before their respective current licenses expire in 2024 and 2025 or prior to the expiration of any renewed license and extended operations period. In such an instance, the Utility could be required to record a charge for the remaining amount of its unrecovered investment and such charge could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
If Diablo Canyon is retired by 2025, in order to retain highly skilled personnel necessary to safely operate Diablo Canyon during the remaining years of operations, the Utility will incur costs in connection with (i) an employee retention program to ensure adequate staffing levels at Diablo Canyon, and (ii) an employee retraining and development program, to facilitate redeployment of a portion of Diablo Canyon personnel to the decommissioning project and elsewhere in the Utility. There can be no assurance that the Utility will be successful in retaining highly skilled personnel under its employee programs. 
The Utility is pursuing the extension of operations at Diablo Canyon through no later than 2030. If Diablo Canyon enters extended operations, the Utility will face operational challenges resulting from a shortened planning period. For instance, the Utility may be unable to procure an adequate supply of nuclear fuel. For more information, see &#8220;Extension of Diablo Canyon Operations&#8221; under &#8220;Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A. 
The Utility has incurred, and may continue to incur, substantial costs to comply with NRC regulations and orders. See &#8220;Regulatory Environment&#8221; in Item 1. Business above. If the Utility were unable to recover these costs, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. The Utility may determine that it cannot comply with the new regulations or orders in a feasible and economic manner and voluntarily cease operations; alternatively, the NRC may order the Utility to cease operations until the Utility can comply with new regulations, orders, or decisions. The Utility may incur a material charge if it ceases operations at Diablo Canyon&#8217;s two nuclear generation units before their respective current licenses expire in 2024 and 2025. As of December 31, 2022, the Utility&#8217;s unrecovered investment in Diablo Canyon was $840 million. 
The Utility also has an obligation to decommission its electricity generation facilities, including its nuclear facilities, as well as gas transmission system assets, at the end of their useful lives. See &#8220;Asset Retirement Obligations&#8221; in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement in Item 8. The Utility&#8217;s costs to decommission its nuclear facilities through nuclear decommissioning are subject to reasonableness review by the CPUC. The Utility will be responsible for any costs that the CPUC determines were not reasonably incurred. If the Utility&#8217;s actual decommissioning costs, including the amounts held in the nuclear decommissioning trusts, exceed estimated costs, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
The Utility may be unable to attract and retain specialty personnel. 
The Utility&#8217;s workforce is aging, and many employees are or will become eligible to retire within the next few years. Although the Utility has undertaken efforts to recruit and train new field service personnel, the Utility may be faced with a shortage of experienced and qualified personnel in certain specialty operational positions. Additionally, the Utility could experience labor disruptions from personnel in those positions. If the Utility were to experience such a shortage or disruptions, work stoppages could occur. 
Any such occurrences could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
Risks Related to Environmental Factors 
Severe weather conditions, extended drought, and climate change could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility. 
Extreme weather, drought and shifting climate patterns have intensified the challenges associated with many of the other risks facing PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility, particularly wildfire management in California. The Utility&#8217;s service area encompasses some of the most densely forested areas in California and, as a consequence, is subject to higher risk from vegetation-related ignition events than other California IOUs. Further, environmental extremes, such as drought conditions and extreme heat followed by periods of wet weather, can drive additional vegetation growth (which can then fuel fires) and influence both the likelihood and severity of extraordinary wildfire events. In particular, the risk posed by wildfires, including during the recent wildfire seasons, has increased in the Utility&#8217;s service area as a result of an ongoing extended period of drought, bark beetle infestations in the California forest, and wildfire fuel increases due to rising temperatures and record rainfall following the drought, and strong wind events, among other environmental factors. As of December 31, 2022, more than 81% of California is experiencing severe to extreme drought. Moderate or severe drought conditions occur and can persist in virtually all of the Utility&#8217;s service area. More than half of the Utility&#8217;s service area is in an HFTD. Contributing factors other than environmental can include local land use policies and historical forestry management practices. The combined effects of extreme weather and climate change also impact this risk. In January 2018, the CPUC approved a statewide fire-threat map that shows that approximately half of the Utility&#8217;s service area is facing &#8220;elevated&#8221; or &#8220;extreme&#8221; fire danger. Approximately 25,000 circuit miles of the Utility&#8217;s nearly 80,000 distribution overhead circuit miles and approximately 5,500 miles of the nearly 18,000 transmission overhead circuit miles are in such HFTDs, significantly more in total than other California IOUs. 
Severe weather events and other natural disasters, including wildfires and other fires, storms, tornadoes, floods, extreme heat events, drought, earthquakes, lightning, tsunamis, rising sea levels, pandemics, solar events, electromagnetic events, wind events or other weather-related conditions, climate change, or natural disasters, could result in severe business disruptions, prolonged power outages, property damage, injuries and loss of life, significant decreases in revenues and earnings, and significant additional costs to PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility. Any such event could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. Any such event also could lead to significant claims against the Utility. Further, these events could result in regulatory penalties and disallowances, particularly if the Utility encounters difficulties in restoring power to its customers on a timely basis or if the related losses are found to be the result of the Utility&#8217;s practices or the failure of electric and other equipment of the Utility. 
Further, the Utility has been studying the potential effects of climate change (increased severity and frequency of storm events, sea level rise, land subsidence, change in temperature extremes, changes in precipitation patterns and drought, and wildfire) on its assets, operations, and services, and the Utility is developing adaptation plans to set forth a strategy for those events and conditions that the Utility believes are most significant. Consequences of these climate-driven events may vary widely and could include increased stress on the energy supply network due to new patterns of demand, reduced hydroelectric output, physical damage to the Utility&#8217;s infrastructure, higher operational costs, and an increase in the number and duration of customer outages and safety consequences for both employees and customers. As a result, the Utility&#8217;s hydroelectric generation could change, and the Utility would need to consider managing or acquiring additional generation. If the Utility increases its reliance on conventional generation resources to replace hydroelectric generation and to meet increased customer demand, it may become more costly for the Utility to comply with GHG emissions limits. In addition, climate hazards such as heatwaves, windstorms, and flooding caused by rising sea levels and extreme storms could damage the Utility&#8217;s facilities, including gas, generation, and electric transmission and distribution assets. The Utility could incur substantial costs to repair or replace facilities, restore service, or compensate customers and other third parties for damages or injuries. The Utility anticipates that the increased costs would be recovered through rates, but as rate pressures increase, the likelihood of disallowance or non-recovery may increase. See &#8220;Rising rates for the Utility&#8217;s customers could result in circumstances in which the Utility is unable to fully recover costs or earn its authorized ROE&#8221; below. 
Events or conditions caused by climate change could have a material impact on the Utility&#8217;s operations and could result in lower revenues or increased expenses, or both. If the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility&#8217;s rates to reflect the impact of events or conditions caused by climate change, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
The Utility&#8217;s operations are subject to extensive environmental laws, and such laws could change. 
The Utility has been in the past, and may be in the future, required to pay for environmental remediation costs at sites where it is identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws. Although the Utility has recorded liabilities for known environmental obligations, these costs can be difficult to estimate due to uncertainties about the extent of contamination, remediation alternatives, the applicable remediation levels, and the financial ability of other potentially responsible parties. For more information, see Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 
Environmental remediation costs could increase in the future as a result of new legislation, the current trend toward more stringent standards, or stricter and more expansive application of existing environmental regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or failure to comply with the terms of licenses or permits issued by environmental or regulatory agencies, could expose the Utility to claims by third parties or the imposition of civil or criminal fines or other sanctions. 
The CPUC has authorized the Utility to recover its environmental remediation costs for certain sites through various ratemaking mechanisms. One of these mechanisms allows the Utility rate recovery for 90% of its hazardous substance remediation costs for certain approved sites without a reasonableness review. The CPUC may discontinue or change these ratemaking mechanisms in the future, or the Utility may incur environmental costs that exceed amounts the CPUC has authorized the Utility to recover through rates. 
Some of the Utility&#8217;s environmental costs, such as the remediation costs associated with the Hinkley natural gas compressor site, are not recoverable through rates or insurance. See &#8220;Environmental Regulation&#8221; in Item 1. and Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The Utility&#8217;s costs to remediate groundwater contamination near the Hinkley natural gas compressor site and to abate the effects of the contamination, changes in estimated costs, and the extent to which actual remediation costs differ from recorded liabilities have had, and may continue to have, a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
Risks Related to Other Enforcement Matters, Investigations, and Regulatory Proceedings 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are subject to the Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Process. 
The EOEP is a six-step process with potentially escalating CPUC oversight and enforcement measures based on specific &#8220;triggering events&#8221; identified for each of the six steps. If the Utility is placed into the EOEP, it will be subject to additional reporting requirements and additional monitoring and oversight by the CPUC. Higher steps of the process (steps 3 through 6) also contemplate additional enforcement mechanisms, including appointment of an independent third-party monitor, appointment of a chief restructuring officer, pursuit of the receivership remedy, and review of the Utility&#8217;s Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (i.e., its license to operate as a utility). The process contains provisions for the Utility to cure and exit the process if it can satisfy specific criteria. The EOEP states that the Utility should presumptively move through the steps of the process sequentially, but the CPUC may place the Utility into the appropriate step of the process upon occurrence of a specified triggering event. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility could be materially affected by legislative and regulatory developments. 
The Utility and its operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and orders. The Utility incurs significant capital, operating, and other costs associated with compliance with these rules. These rules could change, which could change the Utility&#8217;s compliance obligations and the costs to comply with these rules. Non-compliance with these rules could result in the imposition of material fines on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility, other regulatory exposure, significant litigation, and reputational harm, which could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
Wildfire 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected if the Wildfire Fund does not effectively mitigate the financial risk of liability for damages arising from catastrophic wildfires where the Utility&#8217;s facilities are a substantial cause. See &#8220;The Wildfire Fund and other provisions of AB 1054 may not effectively mitigate the risk of liability for damages arising from catastrophic wildfires.&#8221; above. 
Privacy 
In June 2018, the State of California enacted the CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, with a 12-month look-back period requiring compliance by January 1, 2019. The State of California announced enacted regulations in August 2020 and March 2021 which provide guidance on the requirements of the CCPA. The CCPA requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices, allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and provides a new cause of action for data breaches. The CCPA provides for financial penalties in the event of non-compliance and statutory damages in the event of a data security breach. On November 3, 2020, Californians voted to approve Proposition 24, a ballot measure that creates the California Privacy Rights Act (the &#8220;CPRA&#8221;), which amended and expanded the CCPA. The State of California enacted the CPRA in November 2020, with most provisions operative as of January 1, 2023 and applicable to personal information collected beginning January 1, 2022. Final CPRA regulations are in development. Failure to comply with the CCPA and the CPRA could result in litigation, audits, and the imposition of material fines on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility. 
Additionally, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility collect and retain certain personal information of their customers, shareholders, and employees in connection with their business. Although PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility invest in risk management and information security measures, the personal information that they collect, as well as other commercially-sensitive data that they possess, could become compromised because of certain events, including a cyber incident, the insufficiency or failure of such measures, human error, the misappropriation of data, or the occurrence of any of the foregoing at any third party with which PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility has shared information. If any of these events were to transpire, it could subject PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility to financial liability. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are subject to federal and state privacy laws, which grant consumers rights and protections, including, among other things, the ability to opt out of receiving certain communications and certain data sharing with third parties. 
Environmental 
The environmental rules to which the Utility&#8217;s operations are subject relate to air quality, water quality and usage, remediation of hazardous substances, and the protection and conservation of natural resources and wildlife. 
Also, SB 100 (the 100 Percent Clean Energy Act of 2018) increased the percentage from 50% to 60% of California&#8217;s electricity portfolio that must come from renewables by 2030; and established state policy that 100% of all retail electricity sales must come from renewable portfolio standard-eligible or carbon-free resources by 2045. Failure to comply with SB 100 could result in fines imposed on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility that could be material. 
The Utility is subject to extensive regulations and the risk of enforcement proceedings in connection with compliance with such regulations. 
The Utility is subject to extensive regulations, including federal, state, and local energy, environmental and other laws and regulations, and the risk of enforcement proceedings in connection with compliance with such regulations. The Utility could incur material charges, including fines and other penalties, in connection with the Safety Culture OII (as defined in &#8220;Order Instituting an Investigation into PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s Safety Culture&#8221; under &#8220;Regulatory Matters&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A) and other matters that the CPUC&#8217;s SED may be investigating. The SED could launch investigations at any time on any issue it deems appropriate. In addition, OEIS has authority to approve and oversee compliance with the WMP and may determine that the Utility has failed to substantially comply with its WMP. 
The Utility could be subject to additional regulatory or governmental enforcement action in the future with respect to compliance with federal, state, or local laws, regulations or orders that could result in additional fines, penalties or customer refunds, including those regarding renewable energy and RA requirements; customer billing; customer service; affiliate transactions; vegetation management; design, construction, operating and maintenance practices; safety and inspection practices; compliance with CPUC GOs or other applicable CPUC decisions or regulations; whether the Utility is able to achieve the targets in its WMPs; federal electric reliability standards; and environmental compliance. CPUC staff could also impose penalties on the Utility in the future in accordance with its authority under the gas and electric safety citation programs. The amount of such fines, penalties, or customer refunds depends on a variety of factors and could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The Utility also is a target of a number of investigations, in addition to certain investigations in connection with the wildfires. See &#8220;Risks Related to Wildfires&#8221; above. The Utility is unable to predict the outcome of pending investigations, including whether any charges will be brought against the Utility, or the amount of any costs and expenses associated with such investigations. 
If these investigations result in enforcement action against the Utility, the Utility could incur additional fines or penalties, the amount of which could be substantial, and, in the event of a judgment against the Utility, suffer further ongoing negative consequences. Furthermore, a negative outcome in any of these investigations, or future enforcement actions, could negatively affect the outcome of future ratemaking and regulatory proceedings to which the Utility may be subject; for example, by enabling parties to challenge the Utility&#8217;s request to recover costs that the parties allege are somehow related to the Utility&#8217;s violations. 
The Utility&#8217;s ratemaking and cost recovery proceedings may not authorize sufficient revenues, or the Utility&#8217;s actual costs could exceed its authorized or forecasted costs due to various factors, including if the Utility is not able to manage its costs effectively. 
The Utility&#8217;s financial results depend on its ability to earn a reasonable return on capital, including long-term debt and equity, and to recover costs from its customers, through the rates it charges its customers as approved by the CPUC and the FERC. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected if the CPUC or the FERC does not authorize sufficient revenues for the Utility or if the amount of actual costs incurred differs from the forecast or authorized costs embedded in rates. The outcome of the Utility&#8217;s ratemaking proceedings can be affected by many factors, including the level of opposition by intervening parties; potential rate impacts; increasing levels of regulatory review; changes in the political, regulatory, or legislative environments; and the opinions of the Utility&#8217;s regulators, consumer and other stakeholder organizations, and customers, about the Utility&#8217;s ability to provide safe, reliable, and affordable electric and gas services. If the CPUC does not authorize sufficient funding for investments in the Utility&#8217;s infrastructure, it may negatively impact the Utility's ability to modernize the grid and make it resilient to risks related to climate change, including wildfires. 
In addition to the amount of authorized revenues, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected if the Utility&#8217;s actual costs differ from authorized or forecast costs. The Utility&#8217;s ability to recover its costs and earn a reasonable rate of return can be affected by many factors, including the time delay between when costs are incurred and when those costs are recovered through rates. The CPUC or the FERC may not allow the Utility to recover costs on the basis that such costs were not reasonably or prudently incurred or for other reasons. Further, the Utility may be required to incur expenses before the relevant regulatory agency approves the recovery of such costs. For example, the Utility has incurred, and continues to incur, costs to strengthen its wildfire mitigation and prevention efforts before it is clear whether such costs will be recoverable through rates. Also, the CPUC may deny recovery of uninsured wildfire-related costs incurred by the Utility if the CPUC determines that the Utility was not prudent. 
The Utility may incur additional costs or receive reduced revenue for many reasons including changing market circumstances, unanticipated events (such as wildfires, storms, earthquakes, accidents, or catastrophic or other events affecting the Utility&#8217;s operations), increased self-generation by customers, an increase in distributed generation, lower customer demand due to adverse economic conditions, the loss of the Utility&#8217;s customers to other retail providers like CCAs or DA providers, whether the CAISO wholesale electricity market continues to function effectively, returning customers, or compliance with new state laws or policies. See &#8220;Trends in Market Demand and Competitive Conditions in the Electricity Industry&#8221; in Item 1. 
Jurisdictions may attempt to acquire the Utility&#8217;s assets through eminent domain. 
Jurisdictions may attempt to acquire the Utility&#8217;s assets through eminent domain (&#8220;municipalization&#8221;). In particular, the City and County of San Francisco (&#8220;San Francisco&#8221;) has submitted a petition with the CPUC seeking a valuation of the Utility&#8217;s electric assets in San Francisco and has expressed intent to acquire such assets. While San Francisco would still need to, among other things, initiate and prevail in an eminent domain action in state court to acquire the Utility&#8217;s assets, there is no guarantee that the Utility would be successful in defending against such an action or related regulatory proceeding. If municipalization proceedings are permitted to move forward and are successful, the Utility would be entitled to receive the fair market value of the assets that are subject to the takeover effort, but the valuation issues in any municipalization proceeding would be highly contentious and could result in the Utility receiving less than what it believes is just compensation for the applicable assets. Any assets acquired by a third party through eminent domain would be excluded from the Utility&#8217;s rate base, reducing the Utility&#8217;s revenues and opportunity to earn a return on such assets. Assets that are targeted for municipalization generally are located in geographic areas that have a lower cost of service relative to billed revenues, so municipalization could negatively impact the affordability of the Utility&#8217;s service for remaining Utility customers served outside of those geographic areas. A successful municipalization attempt could also encourage similar attempts by other municipalities which, if successful, would further divide the Utility&#8217;s assets and reduce the Utility&#8217;s rate base, profitability, and affordability for remaining Utility customers. It is also unclear how the CPUC would allocate the compensation received by the Utility for its assets between shareholders and customers. As a result of these factors, municipalization could materially affect the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flow. 
Risks Related to PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s Environment and Financial Condition 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s substantial indebtedness may adversely affect their financial health and operating flexibility. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have a substantial amount of indebtedness, most of which is secured by liens on certain assets of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility. As of December 31, 2022, PG&#38;E Corporation had approximately $4.68 billion of outstanding indebtedness (such indebtedness consisting of PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2028, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2030, and borrowings under the $2.75 billion secured term loan agreement entered into in June 2020), and the Utility had approximately $45.6 billion of outstanding indebtedness. In addition, PG&#38;E Corporation had $500 million of additional borrowing capacity under the Corporation Revolving Credit Agreement, and the Utility had $1.5 billion of additional borrowing capacity under the Utility Revolving Credit Agreement. In addition, the Utility had outstanding preferred stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of $252 million. 
Since PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have a high level of debt, a substantial portion of cash flow from operations will be used to make payments on this debt. Furthermore, since a significant percentage of the Utility&#8217;s assets are used to secure its debt, this reduces the amount of collateral available for future secured debt or credit support and reduces its flexibility in operating these secured assets. This relatively high level of debt and related security could have other important consequences for PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility, including: 
Under the terms of the agreements and indentures governing their respective indebtedness, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are permitted to incur additional indebtedness, some of which could be secured (subject to compliance with certain tests) and which could further accentuate these risks. As a result of the high level of indebtedness, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility may be unable to generate sufficient cash through operations to service such debt, and may need to refinance such indebtedness at or prior to maturity and be unable to obtain financing on suitable terms or at all. As a capital-intensive company, the Utility relies on access to the capital markets. If the Utility were unable to access the capital markets or the cost of financing were to substantially increase, its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. The Utility&#8217;s ability to obtain financing, as well as its ability to refinance debt and make scheduled payments of principal and interest, are dependent on numerous factors, including the Utility&#8217;s levels of indebtedness, maintenance of acceptable credit ratings, financial performance, liquidity and cash flow, and other market conditions. The Utility&#8217;s inability to service its substantial debt or access the financial markets on reasonable terms could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The documents that govern PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s indebtedness limit their flexibility in operating their business. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s material financing agreements, including certain of their respective credit agreements and indentures, contain various covenants restricting, among other things, their ability to: 
The restrictions contained in these material financing agreements could affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to operate their business and may limit their ability to react to market conditions or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. For example, such restrictions could adversely affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to finance their operations and expenditures, make strategic acquisitions, investments, or alliances, sell assets, restructure their organization, or finance their capital needs. Additionally, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond their control, including prevailing regulatory, economic, financial and industry conditions. 
Parties have appealed the Confirmation Order. 
Following entry of the Confirmation Order confirming the Plan, certain parties filed notices of appeal with respect to the Confirmation Order. While a number of such appeals have been dismissed, there can be no assurance that any of the remaining appeals will not be successful and, if successful, that any such appeal would not have a material adverse effect on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 
PG&#38;E Corporation may be required to issue shares with respect to HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims, which would result in dilution to holders of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock, or pay a material amount of cash with respect to allowed Subordinated Debt Claims. 
On the Emergence Date, PG&#38;E Corporation issued to the Fire Victim Trust a number of shares of common stock equal to 22.19% of the outstanding common stock on such date. As further described in &#8220;Satisfaction of HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims and Subordinated Debt Claims&#8221; in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, PG&#38;E Corporation may be required to issue shares of its common stock in satisfaction of allowed HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims. If such issuance is required, it may be determined that, under the Plan, the Fire Victim Trust should receive additional shares of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock such that it would have owned 22.19% of the outstanding common stock of reorganized PG&#38;E Corporation on the Emergence Date, assuming that such issuance of shares in satisfaction of the HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims had occurred on the Emergence Date. Any such issuances will result in dilution to anyone who holds shares of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock prior to such issuance and may cause the trading price of PG&#38;E Corporation shares to decline. 
Additionally, PG&#38;E Corporation may be required to pay a material amount of cash with respect to allowed Subordinated Debt Claims (as defined in &#8220;Satisfaction of HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims and Subordinated Debt Claims&#8221; in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8). Such payment may have a material adverse impact on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
Any substantial sale of stock by existing stockholders could depress the market value of PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s common stock, thereby devaluing the market price. 
Certain stockholders, including the Fire Victim Trust, received a large number of shares in the Chapter 11 Cases and may continue to hold shares of PG&#38;E Corporation. PG&#38;E Corporation can make no prediction as to the effect, if any, that sales of shares, or the availability of shares for future sale, will have on the prevailing market price of shares of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of shares of common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could depress prevailing market prices for such shares. Such sales may also make it more difficult for PG&#38;E Corporation to sell equity securities or equity-linked securities in the future at a time and price which it deems appropriate. 
PG&#38;E Corporation may also sell additional shares of common stock in subsequent offerings or issue additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into shares of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock. The issuance of any shares of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock in future financings, acquisitions upon conversion or exercise of convertible securities, or otherwise may result in a reduction of the book value and market price of PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s outstanding common stock. If PG&#38;E Corporation issues any such additional shares, the issuance will cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of all current shareholders. PG&#38;E Corporation cannot predict the size of future issuances of shares of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock or securities convertible into shares of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock or, for any issuance, the effect, if any, that such future issuances will have on the market price of PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s common stock. 
PG&#38;E Corporation common stock is subject to ownership and transfer restrictions intended to preserve PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes. 
PG&#38;E Corporation has incurred and may also continue to incur, in connection with the Plan, significant net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes, the amount and availability of which are subject to certain qualifications, limitations and uncertainties. The Amended Articles (as defined below) impose certain restrictions on the transferability and ownership of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock and preferred stock (together, the &#8220;capital stock&#8221;) and other interests designated as &#8220;stock&#8221; of PG&#38;E Corporation by the Board of Directors as disclosed in an SEC filing (such stock and other interests, the &#8220;Equity Securities,&#8221; and such restrictions on transferability and ownership, the &#8220;Ownership Restrictions&#8221;) in order to reduce the possibility of an equity ownership shift that could result in limitations on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes from prior taxable years or periods for federal income tax purposes. Any acquisition of PG&#38;E Corporation capital stock that results in a shareholder being in violation of these restrictions may not be valid. 
Subject to certain exceptions, the Ownership Restrictions restrict (i) any person or entity (including certain groups of persons) from directly or indirectly acquiring or accumulating 4.75% or more of the outstanding Equity Securities and (ii) the ability of any person or entity (including certain groups of persons) already owning, directly or indirectly, 4.75% or more of the Equity Securities to increase their proportionate interest in the Equity Securities. For more information, see &#8220;Because PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have elected to treat the Fire Victim Trust as a grantor trust, the application of the Ownership Restrictions, as defined in PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s Amended Articles of Incorporation, will be determined on the basis of a number of shares outstanding that could differ materially from the number of shares reported as outstanding on the cover page of its periodic reports under the Exchange Act&#8221; below. Any transferee receiving Equity Securities that would result in a violation of the Ownership Restrictions will not be recognized as a shareholder of PG&#38;E Corporation or entitled to any rights of shareholders, including, without limitation, the right to vote and to receive dividends or distributions, whether liquidating or otherwise, in each case, with respect to the Equity Securities causing the violation. 
The Ownership Restrictions remain in effect until the earliest of (i) the repeal, amendment, or modification of Section 382 (and any comparable successor provision) of the IRC, in a manner that renders the restrictions imposed by Section 382 of the IRC no longer applicable to PG&#38;E Corporation, (ii) the beginning of a taxable year in which the Board of Directors of PG&#38;E Corporation determines that no tax benefits attributable to net operating losses or other tax attributes are available, (iii) the date selected by the Board of Directors if it determines that the limitation amount imposed by Section 382 of the IRC as of such date in the event of an &#8220;ownership change&#8221; of PG&#38;E Corporation (as defined in Section 382 of the IRC and Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1502-91 et seq.) would not be materially less than the net operating loss carryforwards or &#8220;net unrealized built-in loss&#8221; (within the meaning of Section 382 of the IRC and Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1502-91 et seq.) of PG&#38;E Corporation, and (iv) the date selected by the Board of Directors if it determines that it is in the best interests of PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s shareholders for the Ownership Restrictions to be removed or released. The Ownership Restrictions may also be waived by the Board of Directors on a case by case basis. 
Because PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have elected to treat the Fire Victim Trust as a grantor trust, the application of the Ownership Restrictions, as defined in PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s Amended Articles of Incorporation, will be determined on the basis of a number of shares outstanding that could differ materially from the number of shares reported as outstanding on the cover page of its periodic reports under the Exchange Act. 
The Plan contemplated that the Fire Victim Trust would be treated as a &#8220;qualified settlement fund&#8221; for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes, subject to PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s ability to elect to treat the Fire Victim Trust as a grantor trust for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes instead. On July 8, 2021, PG&#38;E Corporation, the Utility, ShareCo, and the Fire Victim Trust entered into the Share Exchange and Tax Matters Agreement, pursuant to which PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility made a grantor trust election for the Fire Victim Trust effective retroactively to the inception of the Fire Victim Trust. 
As a result of the grantor trust election, shares of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock owned by the Fire Victim Trust are treated as held by the Utility and, in turn attributed to PG&#38;E Corporation for income tax purposes. Consequently, any shares owned by the Fire Victim Trust are effectively excluded from the total number of outstanding equity securities when calculating a person&#8217;s Percentage Stock Ownership (as defined in the Amended Articles) for purposes of the Ownership Restrictions. See &#8220;Tax Matters&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A for an example of these calculations. PG&#38;E Corporation does not control the number of shares held by the Fire Victim Trust and is not able to determine in advance the number of shares the Fire Victim Trust will hold. PG&#38;E Corporation intends to periodically make available to investors information about the number of shares of common stock held by the Fire Victim Trust, the Utility, and ShareCo as of a specified date for purposes of the Ownership Restrictions, including in its Quarterly Reports and Annual Reports filed with the SEC. 
PG&#38;E Corporation intends to enforce the Ownership Restrictions as described in the foregoing paragraph (calculated as excluding any shares owned by the Fire Victim Trust, the Utility, and ShareCo from the number of outstanding equity securities). All current and prospective shareholders are advised to consider the foregoing in determining their ownership and acquisition of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock. 
PG&#38;E Corporation may not be able to use some or all of its net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to 
offset future income. 
As of December 31, 2022, PG&#38;E Corporation had net operating loss carryforwards for PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s consolidated group for U.S. federal and California income tax purposes of approximately $26.6 billion and $25.2 billion, respectively, and PG&#38;E Corporation incurred and may also continue to incur, in connection with the Plan, significant net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes. The ability of PG&#38;E Corporation to use some or all of these net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be subject to certain limitations. Under Section 382 of the IRC (which also applies for California state income tax purposes), if a corporation (or a consolidated group) undergoes an &#8220;ownership change,&#8221; such net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may be subject to certain limitations. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain shareholders (generally five percent shareholders, applying certain look-through and aggregation rules) increases by more than 50% over such shareholders&#8217; lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years). 
As of the date of this report, it is more likely than not that PG&#38;E Corporation has not undergone an ownership change and its net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes are not limited by Section 382 of the IRC. However, whether PG&#38;E Corporation underwent or will undergo an ownership change as a result of the transactions in PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s equity that occurred pursuant to the Plan depends on several factors outside PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s control and the application of certain laws that are uncertain in several respects. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service would not successfully assert that PG&#38;E Corporation has undergone or will undergo an ownership change pursuant to the Plan. In addition, even if these transactions did not cause an ownership change, they may increase the likelihood that PG&#38;E Corporation may undergo an ownership change in the future. If the Internal Revenue Service successfully asserts that PG&#38;E Corporation did undergo, or PG&#38;E Corporation otherwise does undergo, an ownership change, the limitation on its net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes under Section 382 of the IRC could be material to PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
In particular, limitations imposed on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes could cause U.S. federal and California income taxes to be paid earlier than would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes. In addition, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards to fund a customer credit trust is critical to whether the impact of the fixed recovery charges paid by customers pursuant to the SB 901 securitization transactions will be neutral, on average, to such customers. Further, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards is critical to PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s commitment to make certain operating and capital expenditures. Failure to obtain alternative sources of capital could have a material adverse effect on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility and the value of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s ability to pay dividends on shares of its common stock is subject to restrictions. 
Pursuant to the Confirmation Order, PG&#38;E Corporation may not pay dividends on shares of its common stock until it recognizes $6.2 billion in Non-GAAP Core Earnings following the Emergence Date. &#8220;Non-GAAP Core Earnings&#8221; means GAAP earnings adjusted for certain non-core items as described in the Plan. 
Subject to the foregoing restrictions, any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant. 
PG&#38;E Corporation is a holding company and relies on dividends, distributions and other payments, advances, and transfers of funds from the Utility to meet its obligations. 
PG&#38;E Corporation conducts its operations primarily through its subsidiary, the Utility, and substantially all of PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s consolidated assets are held by the Utility. Accordingly, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s cash flow and its ability to meet its debt service obligations under its existing and future indebtedness are largely dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of the Utility and the distribution or other payment of these earnings and cash flows to PG&#38;E Corporation in the form of dividends or loans or advances and repayment of loans and advances from the Utility. The ability of the Utility to pay dividends or make other advances, distributions, and transfers of funds will depend on its results of operations and may be restricted by, among other things, applicable laws limiting the amount of funds available for payment of dividends and certain restrictive covenants contained in the agreements of those subsidiaries. Additionally, the Utility must use its resources to satisfy its own obligations, including its obligation to serve customers, to pay principal and interest on outstanding debt, to pay preferred stock dividends, and to meet its obligations to employees and creditors, before it can distribute cash to PG&#38;E Corporation. In addition, the CPUC has imposed various conditions that govern the relationship between PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility, including financial conditions that require the Board of Directors to give first priority to the capital requirements of the Utility, as determined to be necessary and prudent to meet the Utility&#8217;s obligation to serve or to operate the Utility in a prudent and efficient manner. PG&#38;E Corporation is unable to predict when it will commence the payment of dividends on its common stock. The deterioration of income from, or other available assets of, the Utility for any reason could limit or impair the Utility&#8217;s ability to pay dividends or other distributions to PG&#38;E Corporation, which could, in turn, materially and adversely affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s ability to meet its obligations. 
California law and certain provisions in the Amended Articles and the amended and restated bylaws of PG&#38;E Corporation (the &#8220;Amended Bylaws&#8221;) may prevent efforts by shareholders to change the direction or management of PG&#38;E Corporation. 
The Amended Articles and the Amended Bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of PG&#38;E Corporation more difficult without the approval of the Board of Directors, including the following: 
These and other provisions in the Amended Articles, the Amended Bylaws, and California law could make it more difficult for shareholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of the Board of Directors or initiate actions that are opposed by the then-current Board of Directors, including delaying or impeding merger, tender offer, or proxy contest involving PG&#38;E Corporation. The existence of these provisions could negatively affect the price of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock and limit opportunities for shareholders to realize value in a corporate transaction. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows have been and could continue to be significantly affected by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows have been (beginning in March 2020) and could continue to be significantly affected by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (and its variants), but the extent of such impact is uncertain. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility continue to evaluate the impact of the current COVID-19 outbreak on their business and financial results. The consequences of a continued and prolonged outbreak and resulting governmental and regulatory orders have had and could continue to have a negative impact on the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic conditions, and resulting decrease in economic and industrial activity in the Utility&#8217;s service area, have and will continue to have a significant adverse impact on the Utility&#8217;s customers. These circumstances have impacted and will continue to impact the Utility for a period of time that PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict. For example, the economic downturn has resulted in a reduction in customer receipts and collection delays throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The Utility&#8217;s accounts receivable balances over 30 days outstanding as of December 31, 2022 were approximately $1.1 billion, or $890 million higher as compared to the balances as of December 31, 2019. The Utility is unable to estimate the portion of the increase directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Utility expects to continue experiencing an impact on monthly cash collections for as long as current COVID-19 circumstances persist. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are unable to quantify the long-term potential impact of the changes in customer collections or changes in energy demand on earnings and cash flows due, in part, to uncertainties regarding the timing, duration and intensity of the COVID-19 outbreak and the resulting economic downturn. Although the CPUC authorized the establishment of memorandum and balancing accounts to track costs associated with customer protection measures, the timing of regulatory relief, if any, and ultimate cost recovery from such accounts or otherwise, are uncertain. 
The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic downturn have resulted and may continue to result in workforce disruptions, both in personnel availability (including a reduction in contract labor resources) and deployment. Increased governmental regulation of the COVID-19 pandemic protections, including vaccination mandates or testing requirements for workers, could result in employee attrition, workforce disruptions and increased supplier and contractor costs. 
Although the Utility continues to prioritize customer and community safety, these disruptions necessitate changes to the Utility&#8217;s operating and capital expenditure plans, which could lead to project delays or service disruptions in certain programs. Delays in production and shipping of materials used in the Utility&#8217;s operations may also impact operations. 
The Utility has experienced shortages in certain materials, longer lead times and delivery delays as a result of domestic and international raw material and labor shortages. If these disruptions to the supply chain persist or worsen, the Utility may be delayed or prevented from completing planned maintenance and capital projects work. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility expect additional financial impacts in the future as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Potential longer-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility include the potential for higher credit spreads, borrowing costs and incremental financing needs. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s analysis of the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing and subject to change. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict the timing, duration or intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic situation and any resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic and any variant strains of the COVID-19 virus, the effectiveness and intensity of measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic (including availability and effectiveness of vaccines), and the effects of the COVID-19 situation on the business, financial condition and results of operations of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility and on the business and general economic conditions in the State of California and the United States of America. 
Rising rates for the Utility&#8217;s customers could result in circumstances in which the Utility is unable to fully recover costs or earn its authorized ROE. 
The rates paid by the Utility&#8217;s customers are impacted by the Utility&#8217;s costs, commodity prices, and broader energy trends. The Utility&#8217;s capital investment plan, increasing procurement of renewable power and energy storage, increasing environmental regulations, leveling demand, and the cumulative impact of other public policy requirements, collectively place continuing upward pressure on customer rates. In particular, the Utility will need to make substantial, sustained investments to its infrastructure to adapt to climate change. For more information on factors that could cause the Utility&#8217;s costs to increase, see &#8220;The Utility&#8217;s ratemaking and cost recovery proceedings may not authorize sufficient revenues, or the Utility&#8217;s actual costs could exceed its authorized or forecasted costs due to various factors, including if the Utility is not able to manage its costs effectively&#8221; above. If customer rates increase, the CPUC may face greater pressure to approve lesser amounts in the Utility&#8217;s ratemaking or cost recovery proceedings. 
The Utility generally recovers its electricity and natural gas procurement costs through rates as &#8220;pass-through&#8221; costs. Increases in the Utility&#8217;s commodity costs directly impact customer bills. 
Increasing levels of self-generation of electricity by customers (primarily solar installations) and customer enrollment in NEM, which allows self-generating customers to receive bill credits for power exported to the grid at the full retail rate, shifts costs to other customers. Under this structure, NEM customers do not pay their proportionate share of the cost of maintaining and operating the electric transmission and distribution system, including costs associated with funding social equity programs, subject to certain exceptions, while still receiving electricity from the system when their self-generation is inadequate to meet their electricity needs. These unpaid costs are subsidized by customers not participating in NEM. Accordingly, as more electric customers switch to NEM and self-generate energy, the burden on the remaining customers increases, which in turn encourages more self-generation, further increasing rate pressure on existing non-NEM customers. 
Other long-term trends could also increase costs for gas customers. Natural gas suppliers are subject to compliance with CARB&#8217;s cap-and-trade program, and natural gas end-use customers have an increasing exposure to carbon costs under the program through 2030 (when the full cost will be reflected in customer bills). CARB may also require aggressive energy efficiency programs to reduce natural gas end use. Increased renewable portfolio standards in the electric sector could reduce electric generation gas load. Additionally, customers replacing natural gas appliances with electric appliances will lead to further reduced gas demand. The combination of reduced load and increased costs to maintain the gas system could result in higher natural gas customer bills. In addition, some local city governments have passed ordinances restricting use of natural gas in new construction and, if other jurisdictions follow suit, this could affect future demand for the provision of natural gas. If fewer customers receive gas from the Utility, the Utility&#8217;s gas system maintenance costs, many of which cannot be reduced in the short term even if gas quantities decrease, would be borne by fewer customers. Finally, a mandate to purchase renewable natural gas for core customers could lead to increased costs for core customers if utilities are competing with the transportation sector for supplies of renewable natural gas. 
A confluence of technology-related cost declines and sustained federal or state subsidies could make a combination of distributed generation and energy storage a viable, cost-effective alternative to the Utility&#8217;s bundled electric service which could further reduce energy demand. Reduced energy demand or significantly slowed growth in demand due to customer migration to other energy providers, adoption of energy efficient technology, conservation, increasing levels of distributed generation and self-generation, unless substantially offset through regulatory cost allocations, could increase the energy rates for other customers. 
If rates were to rise too rapidly, customer usage could decline. This decline would decrease the volume of sales, among which the Utility&#8217;s costs are allocated, and increase rates. 
To relieve some of this upward rate pressure, the CPUC may authorize lower revenues than the Utility requested or increase the period over which the Utility is allowed to recover amounts, which could impact the Utility&#8217;s ability to timely recover its operating costs. The Utility&#8217;s level of authorized capital investment could decline as well, leading to a slower growth in rate base and earnings. As a result, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
Inflation may negatively impact PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial conditions, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have observed that prices for equipment, materials, supplies, employee labor, contractor services, and variable-rate debt have increased. Long-term inflationary pressures may result in such prices continuing to increase more quickly than expected. Increases in inflation raises costs for labor, materials and services, and PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility may be unable to secure these resources on economically acceptable terms or offset such costs with increased revenues, operating efficiencies, or cost savings, which may adversely impact PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial conditions, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.

PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results can be affected by many factors, including estimates and assumptions used in the critical accounting estimates described in Item 7. MD&#38;A, that can cause their actual financial results to differ materially from historical results or from anticipated future financial results. The following discussion of key risk factors should be considered in evaluating an investment in PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility and should be read in conjunction with Item 7. MD&#38;A and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this 2021 Form 10-K. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
Risk Factors Summary 
The following is a summary of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, operations, and financial results. These risks are discussed more fully below. 
Risks related to wildfires, including risks related to: 
Risks related to operations and information technology, including risks related to: 
Risks related to environmental factors, including risks related to: 
Risks related to enforcement matters, investigations, and regulatory proceedings, including risks related to: 
Risks related to the environment and financial condition, including risks related to: 
General risks, including related to: 
Risks Related to Wildfires 
The Wildfire Fund and other provisions of AB 1054 may not effectively mitigate the risk of liability for damages arising from catastrophic wildfires. 
If the Utility does not have an approved WMP, the Utility will not be issued a safety certification and will consequently not benefit from the presumption of prudency or the AB 1054 disallowance cap. Under AB 1054, the Utility is required to maintain a safety certification issued by the OEIS to be eligible for certain benefits, including a cap on Wildfire Fund reimbursement and a reformed prudent manager standard. The AB 1054 Wildfire Fund disallowance cap, which caps the amount of liability that the Utility could be required to bear for a catastrophic wildfire, is inapplicable if the Wildfire Fund administrator determines that the electric utility company&#8217;s actions or inactions that resulted in the applicable wildfire constituted &#8220;conscious or willful disregard for the rights and safety of others,&#8221; or the electric utility company fails to maintain a valid safety certification at the time the applicable wildfire ignited. In addition, if the Utility fails to maintain a valid safety certificate at the time a wildfire ignites, the initial burden of proof in a prudency proceeding shifts from intervenors to the Utility. The Utility will be required to reimburse amounts that are determined by the CPUC not to be just and reasonable. For more information on the disallowance cap, see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 
Furthermore, the Wildfire Fund will only be available for payment of eligible claims so long as there are sufficient funds remaining in the Wildfire Fund. Such funds could be depleted more quickly than expected, including as a result of claims made by California&#8217;s other participating electric utility companies. If the Utility is unable to maintain an AB 1054 safety certification or if the Wildfire Fund is exhausted, the ineffectiveness of the Wildfire Fund could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. Also, the Utility will not be able to obtain any recovery from the Wildfire Fund for wildfire-related losses in any year that do not exceed the greater of $1.0 billion in the aggregate and the amount of insurance coverage required under AB 1054. 
The costs of participating in the Wildfire Fund are expected to exceed $6.7 billion over the anticipated ten-year contribution period for the fund. The timing and amount of any potential charges associated with the Utility&#8217;s contributions would also depend on various factors. In addition, there could also be a significant delay between the occurrence of a wildfire and the timing on which the Utility recognizes impairment for the reduction in future coverage, due to the lack of data available to the Utility following a catastrophic event, especially if the wildfire occurs in the service territory of another participating electric utility. Participation in the Wildfire Fund is expected to have a material impact on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows, and there can be no assurance that the benefits of participating in the Wildfire Fund ultimately outweigh these substantial costs. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility could be liable as a result of the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, or future wildfires. 
Based on the facts and circumstances available as of the date of this report, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have determined that it is probable they will incur losses in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire and the 2021 Dixie fire. Although PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have recorded liabilities for probable losses in connection with these fires, these liability estimates correspond to the lower end of the range of reasonably estimable losses, do not include several categories of potential damages that are not reasonably estimable, and are subject to change based on new information. 
Although there are a number of unknown facts surrounding Cal Fire&#8217;s causation determinations of the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, and the 2021 Dixie fire, the Utility could be subject to significant liability in excess of recoveries that would be expected to have a material impact on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have also received and have responded or are responding to document, data, and other information requests from the CPUC&#8217;s SED and law enforcement agencies that are investigating these wildfires. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility could be the subject of additional investigations, lawsuits, or enforcement actions in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire or other wildfires. For more information, see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 
Under California law (including Penal Code section 1202.4), if the Utility were convicted of any of the charges in the Kincade Amended Complaint or the Zogg Complaint, the sentencing court must order the Utility to &#8220;make restitution to the victim or victims in an amount established by court order&#8221; that is &#8220;sufficient to fully reimburse the victim or victims for every determined economic loss incurred as the result of&#8221; the Utility&#8217;s underlying conduct, in addition to interest and the victim&#8217;s or victims&#8217; attorneys&#8217; fees. This requirement for full reimbursement of economic loss is not waivable by either the government or the victims and is not offset by any compensation that the victims have received or may receive from their insurance carriers. In the event that the Utility were convicted of certain charges in the Kincade Amended Complaint or the Zogg Complaint, the Utility currently believes that, depending on which charges it were to be convicted of, its total losses associated with each of the Kincade Amended Complaint and the Zogg Complaint would materially exceed the $800 million and the $375 million aggregate liability that PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have recorded to reflect the lower end of the range of the reasonably estimable range of losses for the 2019 Kincade fire and 2020 Zogg fire civil claims, respectively. The Utility is currently unable to determine a reasonable estimate of the amount of such additional losses. The Utility does not expect that any of its liability insurance would be available to cover restitution payments ordered by the court presiding over the criminal proceeding. 
There have also been numerous other wildfires in the Utility&#8217;s service territory, of which the Utility has not been alleged or determined to be a cause. The Utility could be alleged or determined to be a cause of one or more of these wildfires. 
Additionally, under the doctrine of inverse condemnation, courts have imposed liability against utilities on the grounds that losses borne by the person whose property was damaged through a public-use undertaking should be spread across the community that benefited from such undertaking, even if the utility is unable to recover these costs through rates. In fact, in December 2017, the CPUC denied recovery of costs that San Diego Gas &#38; Electric Company stated it had incurred as a result of the doctrine of inverse condemnation. Legal challenges to that denial were unsuccessful. Plaintiffs have asserted and continue to assert the doctrine of inverse condemnation in lawsuits related to certain wildfires that occurred in the Utility&#8217;s service territory. Inverse condemnation imposes strict liability (including liability for attorneys&#8217; fees) for damages as a result of the design, construction and maintenance of utility facilities, including utilities&#8217; electric transmission lines. While the Utility currently continues to dispute the applicability of inverse condemnation to the Utility, there can be no assurance that the Utility will be successful in challenging the applicability of inverse condemnation in the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, or other litigation against PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility. 
Although the Utility has taken extensive measures to reduce the threat of future wildfires, the potential that the Utility&#8217;s equipment will be involved in the ignition of future wildfires, including catastrophic wildfires, is significant. This risk may be attributable to, and exacerbated by, a variety of factors, including climate (in particular extended periods of seasonal dryness coupled with periods of high wind velocities and other storms), infrastructure, and vegetation conditions. Despite significant investment in mitigation measures to improve infrastructure and manage vegetation, as well as implementation of de-energization strategies, the Utility may not be successful in mitigating the risk of future wildfires. 
In addition, wildfires have had and, along with any future wildfires, could continue to have, adverse consequences on the Utility&#8217;s proceedings with the CPUC (including the Safety Culture OII) and the FERC, and future regulatory proceedings, including future applications with the OEIS for the safety certification required by AB 1054. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility may also suffer additional reputational harm and face an even more challenging operating, political, and regulatory environment as a result of the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire or any future wildfires. For more information about the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, and the 2021 Dixie fire, see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 
The Utility may be unable to recover all or a significant portion of its excess costs in connection with wildfires from insurance, through rates, or from the Wildfire Fund in a timely manner. 
The Utility could incur substantial costs in excess of insurance coverage or amounts potentially available under the Wildfire Fund under AB 1054 in the future in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire and the 2021 Dixie fire. There can be no assurance that the Utility will be allowed to recover costs in excess of insurance or amounts potentially available under the Wildfire Fund under AB 1054 in the future either through FERC TO rates or as costs recorded to the WEMA, even if a court decision were to determine that the Utility is liable as a result of the application of the doctrine of inverse condemnation. The inability to recover all or a significant portion of costs in excess of insurance through rates or by collecting such rates in a timely manner could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. For more information on wildfire recovery risk, see &#8220;The Wildfire Fund and other provisions of AB 1054 may not effectively mitigate the risk of liability for damages arising from catastrophic wildfires&#8221; above, &#8220;The Utility&#8217;s insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover losses caused by an operating failure or catastrophic events, including severe weather events and events resulting from these conditions (including wildfires), or may not be available at a reasonable cost, or available at all&#8221; below, and Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 
The Utility may not effectively implement its wildfire mitigation initiatives. 
The Utility&#8217;s infrastructure is aging and poses risks to safety and system reliability. Although the Utility spends significant resources on initiatives designed to mitigate wildfire risks, there is no assurance that these initiatives will be successful or effective in reducing wildfire-related losses or that their costs will be fully recoverable through rates. The Utility will face a higher likelihood of catastrophic wildfires in its service territory if it cannot effectively implement these efforts and its WMPs. For example, the Utility may not be able to effectively implement its WMPs if it experiences unanticipated difficulties relative to sourcing, engaging, training, overseeing and retaining contract workers it needs to fulfill its mitigation obligations under the WMPs. The CPUC may assess penalties on the Utility if it finds that the Utility has failed to substantially comply with its WMPs. 
There can be no assurance that the Utility&#8217;s wildfire mitigation initiatives will be effective. For instance, a wildfire may be ignited and spread even in conditions that do not trigger proactive de-energization according to criteria for initiating a PSPS event. The Utility&#8217;s inspections of vegetation near its assets may not detect structural weaknesses within a tree or other issues. If the Utility&#8217;s wildfire mitigation initiatives are not effective, a wildfire could be ignited and spread. 
The PSPS program has been subject to significant scrutiny and criticism by various stakeholders, including customers, regulators, and lawmakers. The Utility also is the subject of a class action litigation in connection with the 2019 PSPS events. 
In addition, on a risk-informed basis, the Utility is making efforts to reduce the frequency and impacts of PSPS. The Utility may be subject to mandated changes to, or restrictions on, its operational practices, regulatory fines and penalties, claims for damages, and reputational harm if the Utility does not execute PSPS in compliance with applicable rules and regulations. The Utility establishes the criteria under which it implements PSPS in its territory. To the extent the Utility&#8217;s criteria for implementing PSPS are not sufficient to mitigate the risk of wildfires, the Utility does not fully implement PSPS when criteria are met due to other overriding conditions or the Utility&#8217;s regulators mandate changes to, or restrictions on, its criteria or other operational PSPS practices, the Utility will face a higher likelihood of catastrophic wildfires in its territory during high-risk weather conditions. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility cannot predict the timing and outcome of the various proceedings and litigation in connection with its wildfire mitigation initiatives. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility could be subject to additional investigations, regulatory proceedings or other enforcement actions as well as to additional litigation and claims by customers as a result of the Utility&#8217;s implementation of its wildfire mitigation initiatives, which could result in fines, penalties, customer rebates or other payments. The amount of any fines, penalties, customer rebates or other payments (if PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility were to issue any credits, rebates or other payments in connection with any other wildfire mitigation initiatives or liability for damages) could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. In addition, the PSPS and EPSS programs have had an adverse impact on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s reputation with customers, regulators and policymakers and future PSPS and EPSS events may increase these negative perceptions. For more information, see &#8220;Regulatory Matters&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A. 
Risks Related to Operations and Information Technology 
The Utility&#8217;s electricity and natural gas operations are inherently hazardous and involve significant risks. 
The Utility owns and operates extensive electricity and natural gas facilities, including two nuclear generation units and an extensive hydroelectric generating system. See &#8220;Electric Utility Operations&#8221; and &#8220;Natural Gas Utility Operations&#8221; in Item 1. above. The Utility undertakes substantial capital investment projects to construct, replace, and improve its electricity and natural gas facilities. In addition, the Utility is obligated to decommission its electricity generation facilities at the end of their useful operating lives, and the CPUC approved retirement of Diablo Canyon by 2024 and 2025. For more information, see &#8220;The operation and decommissioning of the Utility&#8217;s nuclear generation facilities expose it to potentially significant liabilities and the Utility may not be able to fully recover its costs if regulatory requirements or operating conditions change or the facilities cease operations before the licenses expire&#8221; below. 
The Utility&#8217;s ability to efficiently construct, maintain, operate, protect, and decommission its facilities, and provide electricity and natural gas services safely and reliably is subject to numerous risks, many of which are beyond the Utility&#8217;s control, including those that arise from: 
The occurrence of any of these events could interrupt fuel supplies, affect demand for electricity or natural gas, cause unplanned outages or reduce generating output, damage the Utility&#8217;s assets or operations, damage the assets or operations of third parties on which the Utility relies, damage property owned by customers or others, and cause personal injury or death. As a result, the Utility could incur costs to purchase replacement power, to repair assets and restore service, and to compensate third parties. Any of such incidents also could lead to significant claims against the Utility. 
Further, although the Utility often enters into agreements for third-party contractors to perform work, such as patrolling and inspection of facilities, vegetation management, or the construction or demolition or facilities, the Utility may have less control over contractors than its employees and may retain liability for the quality and completion of the contractor&#8217;s work and can be subject to penalties or other enforcement action if the contractor violates applicable laws, rules, regulations, or orders. The Utility may also be subject to liability, penalties or other enforcement action as a result of personal injury or death caused by third-party contractor actions. 
Insurance, equipment warranties, or other contractual indemnification requirements may not be sufficient or effective to provide full or even partial recovery under all circumstances or against all hazards or liabilities to which the Utility may become subject. An uninsured loss could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The Utility&#8217;s insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover losses caused by an operating failure or catastrophic events, including severe weather events and events resulting from these conditions (including wildfires), or may not be available at a reasonable cost, or available at all. 
As a result of the potential application to IOUs of a strict liability standard under the doctrine of inverse condemnation, past losses recorded by insurance companies, past wildfires and the risk of increased wildfires including as a result of climate change, the Utility may not be able to obtain sufficient insurance coverage in the future at a reasonable cost, or at all. 
The Utility has experienced increased costs and difficulties in obtaining insurance coverage for wildfires and other risks that could arise from the Utility&#8217;s ordinary operations. PG&#38;E Corporation, the Utility or its contractors and customers could continue to experience coverage reductions or increased insurance costs in future years. No assurance can be given that future losses will not exceed the limits of the Utility&#8217;s insurance coverage, including losses arising from litigation. Uninsured losses and increases in the cost of insurance may not be recoverable through rates. A loss that is not fully insured or cannot be recovered through rates, and increased insurance costs that are not recoverable, could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The electric power and gas industries are undergoing significant changes driven by technological advancements and a decarbonized economy. 
The electric power industry is undergoing transformative change driven by technological advancements enabling customer choice and state climate policy supporting a decarbonized economy. California utilities also are experiencing increasing deployment by customers and third parties of distributed energy resources, such as on-site solar generation, energy storage, fuel cells, energy efficiency, and demand response technologies. These developments will require modernization of the electric distribution grid to, among other things, accommodate two-way flows of electricity, increase the grid&#8217;s capacity, and interconnect distributed energy resources. In order to enable the California clean energy economy, sustained investments are required in grid modernization, renewable integration projects, energy efficiency programs, energy storage options, EV infrastructure and state infrastructure modernization (e.g., rail and water projects). If the Utility is unable to effectively adapt to these changes, its business model and its ability to execute on its strategy could be materially impacted. 
Various jurisdictions within California have enacted prohibitions or restrictions on use and consumption of natural gas, for example in buildings, that will reduce the use of natural gas. Reducing natural gas use could lead to a reduction in the gas customer base and a diminished need for gas infrastructure and, as a result, could lead to certain gas assets no longer being &#8220;used and useful,&#8221; potentially causing substantial investment value of gas assets to be stranded (under CPUC precedent, when an asset no longer meets the standard of &#8220;used and useful,&#8221; the asset is removed from rate base, which results in a reduction in associated rate recovery). However, while natural gas demand is projected to decline over time, the costs of operating a safe and reliable gas delivery system in California have been increasing, among other things, to cover the cost of long-term pipeline safety enhancements. Inability by the Utility to recover through rates its investments into the natural gas system while still ensuring gas system safety and reliability could materially affect the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
These industry changes, costs associated with complying with new regulatory developments and initiatives and with technological advancements, or the Utility&#8217;s inability to successfully adapt to changes in the electric and gas industry, could materially affect the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The Utility&#8217;s operational networks and information technology systems could be impacted by a cyber incident, cyber security breach, severe natural event, or physical attack. 
The Utility&#8217;s electricity and natural gas systems rely on a complex, interconnected network of generation, transmission, distribution, control, and communication technologies, which can be damaged by natural events-such as severe weather or seismic events-and by malicious events, such as cyber and physical attacks. Private and public entities, such as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and the U.S. federal government, including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Energy, and the White House, have noted that cyber-attacks targeting utility systems are increasing in sophistication, magnitude, and frequency. The Utility&#8217;s operational networks also may face new cyber security risks due to modernizing and interconnecting the existing infrastructure with new technologies and control systems. Any failure or decrease in the functionality of the Utility&#8217;s operational networks could cause harm to the public or employees, significantly disrupt operations, negatively impact the Utility&#8217;s ability to safely generate, transport, deliver and store energy and gas or otherwise operate in the most safe and efficient manner or at all, and damage the Utility&#8217;s assets or operations or those of third parties. 
The Utility also relies on complex information technology systems that allow it to create, collect, use, disclose, store and otherwise process sensitive information, including the Utility&#8217;s financial information, customer energy usage and billing information, and personal information regarding customers, employees and their dependents, contractors, and other individuals. In addition, the Utility often relies on third-party vendors to host, maintain, modify, and update its systems, and to provide other services to the Utility or the Utility&#8217;s customers. In addition, the Utility is increasingly being required to disclose large amounts of data (including customer energy usage and personal information regarding customers) to support changes to California&#8217;s electricity market related to grid modernization and customer choice. These third-party vendors could cease to exist, fail to establish adequate processes to protect the Utility&#8217;s systems and information, or experience security incidents or inadequate security measures. Any incidents or disruptions in the Utility&#8217;s information technology systems could impact the Utility&#8217;s ability to track or collect revenues and to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting. 
The Utility and its third-party vendors have been subject to, and will likely continue to be subject to, breaches and attempts to gain unauthorized access to the Utility&#8217;s information technology systems or confidential data (including information about customers and employees), or to disrupt the Utility&#8217;s operations. None of these breaches or attempts has individually or in the aggregate resulted in a security incident with a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. Despite implementation of security and control measures, there can be no assurance that the Utility will be able to prevent unauthorized access to its operational networks, information technology systems or data, or the disruption of its operations. Such events could subject the Utility to significant expenses, claims by customers or third parties, government inquiries, penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, investigations, and regulatory actions that could result in material fines and penalties, loss of customers and harm to PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s reputation, any of which could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The Utility maintains cyber liability insurance that covers certain damages caused by cyber incidents. However, there is no assurance that adequate insurance will continue to be available at rates the Utility believes are reasonable or that the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident will be covered by insurance or recoverable through rates. 
The operation and decommissioning of the Utility&#8217;s nuclear generation facilities expose it to potentially significant liabilities and the Utility may not be able to fully recover its costs if regulatory requirements or operating conditions change or the facilities cease operations before the licenses expire. 
The operation of the Utility&#8217;s nuclear generation facilities exposes it to potentially significant liabilities from environmental, health and financial risks, such as risks relating to operation of the Diablo Canyon nuclear generation units as well as the storage, handling and disposal of spent nuclear fuel, and the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity, natural disaster, or terrorist act. If the Utility incurs losses that are either not covered by insurance or exceed the amount of insurance available, such losses could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. In addition, the Utility may be required under federal law to pay up to $275 million of liabilities arising out of each nuclear incident occurring not only at the Utility&#8217;s Diablo Canyon facility but at any other nuclear power plant in the United States. 
On January 11, 2018, the CPUC approved the retirement of Diablo Canyon units by 2024 and 2025. However, the Utility continues to face public concern about the safety of nuclear generation and nuclear fuel. Some of these nuclear opposition groups regularly file petitions at the NRC and in other forums challenging the actions of the NRC and urging governmental entities to adopt laws or policies in opposition to nuclear power. Although an action in opposition may ultimately fail, regulatory proceedings may take longer to conclude and be more costly to complete. It is also possible that public pressure could grow leading to adverse changes in legislation, regulations, orders, or their interpretation. As a result, operations at the Utility&#8217;s two nuclear generation units at Diablo Canyon could cease before their respective licenses expire in 2024 and 2025. In such an instance, the Utility could be required to record a charge for the remaining amount of its unrecovered investment and such charge could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
In addition, in order to retain highly skilled personnel necessary to safely operate Diablo Canyon during the remaining years of operations, the Utility will incur costs in connection with (i) an employee retention program to ensure adequate staffing levels at Diablo Canyon, and (ii) an employee retraining and development program, to facilitate redeployment of a portion of Diablo Canyon personnel to the decommissioning project and elsewhere in the Utility. There can be no assurance that the Utility will be successful in retaining highly skilled personnel under its employee programs. 
The Utility has incurred, and may continue to incur, substantial costs to comply with NRC regulations and orders. See &#8220;Regulatory Environment&#8221; in Item 1. Business above. If the Utility were unable to recover these costs, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. The Utility may determine that it cannot comply with the new regulations or orders in a feasible and economic manner and voluntarily cease operations; alternatively, the NRC may order the Utility to cease operations until the Utility can comply with new regulations, orders, or decisions. The Utility may incur a material charge if it ceases operations at Diablo Canyon&#8217;s two nuclear generation units before their respective licenses expire in 2024 and 2025. As of December 31, 2021, the Utility&#8217;s unrecovered investment in Diablo Canyon was $1.16 billion. 
The Utility also has an obligation to decommission its electricity generation facilities, including its nuclear facilities, as well as gas transmission system assets, at the end of their useful lives. See &#8220;Asset Retirement Obligations&#8221; in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement in Item 8. The Utility&#8217;s costs to decommission its nuclear facilities through nuclear decommissioning are subject to reasonableness review by the CPUC. The Utility will be responsible for any costs that the CPUC determines were not reasonably incurred. If the Utility&#8217;s actual decommissioning costs, including the amounts held in the nuclear decommissioning trusts, exceed estimated costs, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
Risks Related to Environmental Factors 
Severe weather conditions, extended drought, and climate change could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility. 
Extreme weather, drought and shifting climate patterns have intensified the challenges associated with many of the other risks facing PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility, particularly wildfire management in California. The Utility&#8217;s service territory encompasses some of the most densely forested areas in California and, as a consequence, is subject to higher risk from vegetation-related ignition events than other California IOUs. Further, environmental extremes, such as drought conditions and extreme heat followed by periods of wet weather, can drive additional vegetation growth (which can then fuel fires) and influence both the likelihood and severity of extraordinary wildfire events. In particular, the risk posed by wildfires, including during the 2021 wildfire season, has increased in the Utility&#8217;s service area as a result of an ongoing extended period of drought, bark beetle infestations in the California forest and wildfire fuel increases due to rising temperatures and record rainfall following the drought, and strong wind events, among other environmental factors. As of December 31, 2021, more than 86% of California is experiencing severe to extreme drought. Moderate or severe drought conditions occur and can persist in virtually all of the Utility&#8217;s service territory. More than half of the Utility&#8217;s service area is in an HFTD. Contributing factors other than environmental can include local land use policies and historical forestry management practices. The combined effects of extreme weather and climate change also impact this risk. In January 2018, the CPUC approved a statewide fire-threat map that shows that approximately half of the Utility&#8217;s service territory is facing &#8220;elevated&#8221; or &#8220;extreme&#8221; fire danger. Approximately 25,000 circuit miles of the Utility&#8217;s nearly 81,000 distribution overhead circuit miles and approximately 5,500 miles of the nearly 18,000 transmission overhead circuit miles are in such HFTDs, significantly more in total than other California IOUs. 
Severe weather events and other natural disasters, including wildfires and other fires, storms, tornadoes, floods, extreme heat events (including recent extreme heat events during the 2021 wildfire season), drought, earthquakes, lightning, tsunamis, rising sea levels, pandemics, solar events, electromagnetic events, wind events or other weather-related conditions, climate change, or natural disasters, could result in severe business disruptions, prolonged power outages, property damage, injuries and loss of life, significant decreases in revenues and earnings, and significant additional costs to PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility. Any such event could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. Any of such events also could lead to significant claims against the Utility. Further, these events could result in regulatory penalties and disallowances, particularly if the Utility encounters difficulties in restoring power to its customers on a timely basis or if the related losses are found to be the result of the Utility&#8217;s practices or the failure of electric and other equipment of the Utility. 
Further, the Utility has been studying the potential effects of climate change (increased severity and frequency of storm events, sea level rise, land subsidence, change in temperature extremes, changes in precipitation patterns and drought, and wildfire) on its assets, operations, and services, and the Utility is developing adaptation plans to set forth a strategy for those events and conditions that the Utility believes are most significant. Consequences of these climate-driven events may vary widely and could include increased stress on the energy supply network due to new patterns of demand, reduced hydroelectric output, physical damage to the Utility&#8217;s infrastructure, higher operational costs, and an increase in the number and duration of customer outages and safety consequences for both employees and customers. As a result, the Utility&#8217;s hydroelectric generation could change, and the Utility would need to consider managing or acquiring additional generation. If the Utility increases its reliance on conventional generation resources to replace hydroelectric generation and to meet increased customer demand, it may become more costly for the Utility to comply with GHG emissions limits. In addition, climate hazards such as heatwaves, windstorms, and flooding caused by rising sea levels and extreme storms could damage the Utility&#8217;s facilities, including gas, generation, and electric transmission and distribution assets. The Utility could incur substantial costs to repair or replace facilities, restore service, or compensate customers and other third parties for damages or injuries. The Utility anticipates that the increased costs would be recovered through rates, but as rate pressures increase, the likelihood of disallowance or non-recovery may increase. See &#8220;Rising rates for the Utility&#8217;s customers could result in circumstances in which the Utility is unable to fully recover costs or earn its authorized ROE&#8221; above. 
Events or conditions caused by climate change could have a greater impact on the Utility&#8217;s operations than the Utility&#8217;s studies suggest and could result in lower revenues or increased expenses, or both. If the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility&#8217;s rates to reflect the impact of events or conditions caused by climate change, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
The Utility&#8217;s operations are subject to extensive environmental laws, and such laws could change. 
The Utility&#8217;s operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws, regulations, and orders, relating to air quality, water quality and usage, remediation of hazardous wastes, and the protection and conservation of natural resources and wildlife. The Utility incurs significant capital, operating, and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental statutes, rules, and regulations. The Utility has been in the past, and may be in the future, required to pay for environmental remediation costs at sites where it is identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws. Although the Utility has recorded liabilities for known environmental obligations, these costs can be difficult to estimate due to uncertainties about the extent of contamination, remediation alternatives, the applicable remediation levels, and the financial ability of other potentially responsible parties. For more information, see Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 
Environmental remediation costs could increase in the future as a result of new legislation, the current trend toward more stringent standards, and stricter and more expansive application of existing environmental regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or failure to comply with the terms of licenses or permits issued by environmental or regulatory agencies, could expose the Utility to claims by third parties or the imposition of civil or criminal fines or other sanctions. 
The CPUC has authorized the Utility to recover its environmental remediation costs for certain sites through various ratemaking mechanisms. One of these mechanisms allows the Utility rate recovery for 90% of its hazardous substance remediation costs for certain approved sites without a reasonableness review. The CPUC may discontinue or change these ratemaking mechanisms in the future, or the Utility may incur environmental costs that exceed amounts the CPUC has authorized the Utility to recover through rates. 
Some of the Utility&#8217;s environmental costs, such as the remediation costs associated with the Hinkley natural gas compressor site, are not recoverable through rates or insurance. See &#8220;Environmental Regulation&#8221; in Item 1. and Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The Utility&#8217;s costs to remediate groundwater contamination near the Hinkley natural gas compressor site and to abate the effects of the contamination, changes in estimated costs, and the extent to which actual remediation costs differ from recorded liabilities have had, and may continue to have, a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
Risks Related to Other Enforcement Matters, Investigations, and Regulatory Proceedings 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are subject to the Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Process. 
The EOEP is a six-step process with potentially escalating CPUC oversight and enforcement measures based on specific &#8220;triggering events&#8221; identified for each of the six steps. If the Utility is placed into the EOEP, it will be subject to additional reporting requirements and additional monitoring and oversight by the CPUC. Higher steps of the process (steps 3 through 6) also contemplate additional enforcement mechanisms, including appointment of an independent third-party monitor, appointment of a chief restructuring officer, pursuit of the receivership remedy, and review of the Utility&#8217;s Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (i.e., its license to operate as a utility). The process contains provisions for the Utility to cure and exit the process if it can satisfy specific criteria. The EOEP states that the Utility should presumptively move through the steps of the process sequentially, but the CPUC may place the Utility into the appropriate step of the process upon occurrence of a specified triggering event. 
On April 15, 2021, the CPUC placed the Utility into step 1 of the EOEP for failing to sufficiently prioritize clearing vegetation on its highest risk power lines as part of the 2020 WMP work. There can be no assurance regarding if or when the Utility will exit the EOEP, or whether the CPUC will initiate another step 1 proceeding or whether the CPUC will seek to move the Utility into a higher step of the process. See &#8220;Enforcement and Litigation Matters&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility could be materially affected by legislative and regulatory developments. 
The Utility is subject to extensive regulations. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected if the Wildfire Fund does not effectively mitigate the financial risk of liability for damages arising from catastrophic wildfires where the Utility&#8217;s facilities are a substantial cause. See &#8220;The Wildfire Fund and other provisions of AB 1054 may not effectively mitigate the risk of liability for damages arising from catastrophic wildfires.&#8221; above. 
In June 2018, the State of California enacted the CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, with a 12-month look-back period requiring compliance by January 1, 2019. The State of California announced enacted regulations in August 2020 and March 2021 which provide guidance on the requirements of the CCPA. The CCPA requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices, allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and provides a new cause of action for data breaches. The CCPA provides for financial penalties in the event of non-compliance and statutory damages in the event of a data security breach. On November 3, 2020, Californians voted to approve Proposition 24, a ballot measure that creates the California Privacy Rights Act (the &#8220;CPRA&#8221;), which amended and expanded the CCPA. The State of California enacted the CPRA in November 2020, with most provisions operative as of January 1, 2023 and applicable to personal information collected beginning January 1, 2022. Failure to comply with the CCPA and the CPRA could result in the imposition of material fines imposed on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility. 
Also, SB 100 (the 100 Percent Clean Energy Act of 2018) increased the percentage from 50% to 60% of California&#8217;s electricity portfolio that must come from renewables by 2030; and established state policy that 100% of all retail electricity sales must come from renewable portfolio standard-eligible or carbon-free resources by 2045. Failure to comply with SB 100 could result in fines imposed on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility that could be material. 
The Utility is subject to extensive regulations and the risk of enforcement proceedings in connection with compliance with such regulations. 
The Utility is subject to extensive regulations, including federal, state, and local energy, environmental and other laws and regulations, and the risk of enforcement proceedings in connection with compliance with such regulations. The Utility could incur material charges, including fines and other penalties, in connection with the Safety Culture OII (as defined in &#8220;Order Instituting an Investigation into PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s Safety Culture&#8221; under &#8220;Enforcement and Litigation Matters&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A) and other matters that the CPUC&#8217;s SED may be investigating. The SED could launch investigations at any time on any issue it deems appropriate. In addition, OEIS has authority to approve and oversee compliance with the WMP. 
The Utility could be subject to additional regulatory or governmental enforcement action in the future with respect to compliance with federal, state, or local laws, regulations or orders that could result in additional fines, penalties or customer refunds, including those regarding renewable energy and RA requirements; customer billing; customer service; affiliate transactions; vegetation management; design, construction, operating and maintenance practices; safety and inspection practices; compliance with CPUC GOs or other applicable CPUC decisions or regulations; whether the Utility is able to achieve the targets in its WMPs; federal electric reliability standards; and environmental compliance. CPUC staff could also impose penalties on the Utility in the future in accordance with its authority under the gas and electric safety citation programs. The amount of such fines, penalties, or customer refunds could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The Utility also is a target of a number of investigations, in addition to certain investigations in connection with the wildfires. See &#8220;Risks Related to Wildfires,&#8221; above. The Utility is unable to predict the outcome of pending investigations, including whether any charges will be brought against the Utility, or the amount of any costs and expenses associated with such investigations. 
If these investigations result in enforcement action against the Utility, the Utility could incur additional fines or penalties the amount of which could be substantial and, in the event of a judgment against the Utility, suffer further ongoing negative consequences. Furthermore, a negative outcome in any of these investigations, or future enforcement actions, could negatively affect the outcome of future ratemaking and regulatory proceedings to which the Utility may be subject; for example, by enabling parties to challenge the Utility&#8217;s request to recover costs that the parties allege are somehow related to the Utility&#8217;s violations. 
The Utility&#8217;s ratemaking and cost recovery proceedings may not authorize sufficient revenues, or the Utility&#8217;s actual costs could exceed its authorized or forecasted costs due to various factors, including if the Utility is not able to manage its costs effectively. 
The Utility&#8217;s financial results depend on its ability to earn a reasonable return on capital, including long-term debt and equity, and to recover costs from its customers, through the rates it charges its customers as approved by the CPUC and the FERC. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected if the CPUC or the FERC does not authorize sufficient revenues for the Utility or if the amount of actual costs incurred differs from the forecast or authorized costs embedded in rates. The outcome of the Utility&#8217;s ratemaking proceedings can be affected by many factors, including the level of opposition by intervening parties; potential rate impacts; increasing levels of regulatory review; changes in the political, regulatory, or legislative environments; and the opinions of the Utility&#8217;s regulators, consumer and other stakeholder organizations, and customers, about the Utility&#8217;s ability to provide safe, reliable, and affordable electric and gas services. If the CPUC does not authorize sufficient funding for investments in the Utility&#8217;s infrastructure, it may negatively impact the Utility's ability to modernize the grid and make it resilient to risks related to climate change, including wildfires. 
In addition to the amount of authorized revenues, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected if the Utility&#8217;s actual costs differ from authorized or forecast costs. The Utility&#8217;s ability to recover its costs and earn a reasonable rate of return can be affected by many factors, including the time delay between when costs are incurred and when those costs are recovered through rates. The CPUC or the FERC may not allow the Utility to recover costs on the basis that such costs were not reasonably or prudently incurred or for other reasons. Further, the Utility may be required to incur expenses before the relevant regulatory agency approves the recovery of such costs. For example, the Utility has incurred, and continues to incur, costs to strengthen its wildfire mitigation and prevention efforts before it is clear whether such costs will be recoverable through rates. Also, the CPUC may deny recovery of uninsured wildfire- related costs incurred by the Utility if the CPUC determines that the Utility was not prudent. 
The Utility may incur additional costs or reduced revenue for many reasons including changing market circumstances, unanticipated events (such as wildfires, storms, earthquakes, accidents, or catastrophic or other events affecting the Utility&#8217;s operations), increased self-generation by customers, an increase in distributed generation, lower customer demand due to adverse economic conditions, the loss of the Utility&#8217;s customers to other retail providers like CCAs or DA providers, whether the CAISO wholesale electricity market continues to function effectively, returning customers, or compliance with new state laws or policies. See &#8220;Competition in the Electricity Industry&#8221; in Item 1. 
Risks Related to PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s Environment and Financial Condition 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s substantial indebtedness may adversely affect their financial health and operating flexibility. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have a substantial amount of indebtedness, most of which is secured by liens on certain assets of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility. As of December 31, 2021, PG&#38;E Corporation had approximately $4.71 billion of outstanding indebtedness (such indebtedness consisting of PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2028, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2030, and borrowings under the $2.75 billion secured term loan agreement entered into in June 2020), and the Utility had approximately $38.3 billion of outstanding indebtedness (such indebtedness including outstanding First Mortgage Bonds, borrowings under the Utility Revolving Credit Agreement and borrowings under the Utility Term Loan Credit Agreement). In addition, PG&#38;E Corporation had $500 million of additional borrowing capacity under the Corporation Revolving Credit Agreement, and the Utility had $1.4 billion of additional borrowing capacity under the Utility Revolving Credit Agreement. In addition, the Utility had outstanding preferred stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of $252 million. 
Since PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have a high level of debt, a substantial portion of cash flow from operations will be used to make payments on this debt. Furthermore, since a significant percentage of the Utility&#8217;s assets are used to secure its debt, this reduces the amount of collateral available for future secured debt or credit support and reduces its flexibility in operating these secured assets. This relatively high level of debt and related security could have other important consequences for PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility, including: 
Under the terms of the agreements and indentures governing their respective indebtedness, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are permitted to incur additional indebtedness, some of which could be secured (subject to compliance with certain tests) and which could further accentuate these risks. As a result of the high level of indebtedness, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility may be unable to generate sufficient cash through operations to service such debt, and may need to refinance such indebtedness at or prior to maturity and be unable to obtain financing on suitable terms or at all. As a capital-intensive company, the Utility relies on access to the capital markets. If the Utility were unable to access the capital markets or the cost of financing were to substantially increase, its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. The Utility&#8217;s ability to obtain financing, as well as its ability to refinance debt and make scheduled payments of principal and interest, are dependent on numerous factors, including the Utility&#8217;s levels of indebtedness, maintenance of acceptable credit ratings, financial performance, liquidity and cash flow, and other market conditions. The Utility&#8217;s inability to service its substantial debt or access the financial markets on reasonable terms could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The documents that govern PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s indebtedness limit their flexibility in operating their business. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s material financing agreements, including certain of their respective credit agreements and indentures, contain various covenants restricting, among other things, their ability to: 
The restrictions contained in these material financing agreements could affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to operate their business and may limit their ability to react to market conditions or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. For example, such restrictions could adversely affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to finance their operations and expenditures, make strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances, sell assets, restructure their organization or finance their capital needs. Additionally, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond their control, including prevailing regulatory, economic, financial and industry conditions. 
Parties have appealed the Confirmation Order. 
Following entry of the Confirmation Order confirming the Plan, certain parties filed notices of appeal with respect to the Confirmation Order. While a number of such appeals have been dismissed, there can be no assurance that any of the remaining appeals will not be successful and, if successful, that any such appeal would not have a material adverse effect on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility. 
PG&#38;E Corporation may be required to issue shares with respect to HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims, which would result in dilution to holders of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock, or pay a material amount of cash with respect to allowed Subordinated Debt Claims. 
On the Emergence Date, PG&#38;E Corporation issued to the Fire Victim Trust a number of shares of common stock equal to 22.19 % of the outstanding common stock on such date. As further described in &#8220;Satisfaction of HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims and Subordinated Debt Claims&#8221; in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, PG&#38;E Corporation may be required to issue shares of its common stock in satisfaction of allowed HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims. If such issuance is required, it may be determined that, under the Plan, the Fire Victim Trust should receive additional shares of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock such that it would have owned 22.19 % of the outstanding common stock of reorganized PG&#38;E Corporation on the Emergence Date, assuming that such issuance of shares in satisfaction of the HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims had occurred on the Emergence Date. Any such issuances will result in dilution to anyone who holds shares of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock prior to such issuance and may cause the trading price of PG&#38;E Corporation shares to decline. 
Additionally, PG&#38;E Corporation may be required to pay a material amount of cash with respect to allowed Subordinated Debt Claims (as defined in &#8220;Satisfaction of HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims and Subordinated Debt Claims&#8221; in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8). Such payment may have a material adverse impact on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
Any substantial sale of stock by existing stockholders could depress the market value of PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s common stock, thereby devaluing the market price. 
Certain stockholders, including the Fire Victim Trust, received a large number of shares in the Chapter 11 Cases and may continue to hold shares of PG&#38;E Corporation. PG&#38;E Corporation can make no prediction as to the effect, if any, that sales of shares, or the availability of shares for future sale, will have on the prevailing market price of shares of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of shares of common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could depress prevailing market prices for such shares. Such sales may also make it more difficult for PG&#38;E Corporation to sell equity securities or equity-linked securities in the future at a time and price which it deems appropriate. 
PG&#38;E Corporation may also sell additional shares of common stock in subsequent offerings or issue additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into shares of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock. The issuance of any shares of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock in future financings, acquisitions upon conversion or exercise of convertible securities, or otherwise may result in a reduction of the book value and market price of PG&#38;E Corporation's outstanding common stock. If PG&#38;E Corporation issues any such additional shares, the issuance will cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of all current shareholders. PG&#38;E Corporation cannot predict the size of future issuances of shares of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock or securities convertible into shares of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock or, for any issuance, the effect, if any, that such future issuances will have on the market price of PG&#38;E Corporation's common stock. 
PG&#38;E Corporation common stock is subject to ownership and transfer restrictions intended to preserve PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes. 
PG&#38;E Corporation has incurred and may also continue to incur in connection with the Plan significant net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes, the amount and availability of which are subject to certain qualifications, limitations and uncertainties. The Amended Articles (as defined below) impose certain restrictions on the transferability and ownership of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock and preferred stock (together, the &#8220;capital stock&#8221;) and other interests designated as &#8220;stock&#8221; of PG&#38;E Corporation by the Board of Directors as disclosed in an SEC filing (such stock and other interests, the &#8220;Equity Securities,&#8221; and such restrictions on transferability and ownership, the &#8220;Ownership Restrictions&#8221;) in order to reduce the possibility of an equity ownership shift that could result in limitations on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes from prior taxable years or periods for federal income tax purposes. Any acquisition of PG&#38;E Corporation capital stock that results in a shareholder being in violation of these restrictions may not be valid. 
Subject to certain exceptions, the Ownership Restrictions restrict (i) any person or entity (including certain groups of persons) from directly or indirectly acquiring or accumulating 4.75% or more of the outstanding Equity Securities and (ii) the ability of any person or entity (including certain groups of persons) already owning, directly or indirectly, 4.75% or more of the Equity Securities to increase their proportionate interest in the Equity Securities. For more information, see &#8220;Because PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have elected to treat the Fire Victim Trust as a grantor trust, the application of the Ownership Restrictions, as defined in PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s Amended Articles of Incorporation, will be determined on the basis of a number of shares outstanding that could differ materially from the number of shares reported as outstanding on the cover page of its periodic reports under the Exchange Act&#8221; below. Any transferee receiving Equity Securities that would result in a violation of the Ownership Restrictions will not be recognized as a shareholder of PG&#38;E Corporation or entitled to any rights of shareholders, including, without limitation, the right to vote and to receive dividends or distributions, whether liquidating or otherwise, in each case, with respect to the Equity Securities causing the violation. 
The Ownership Restrictions remain in effect until the earliest of (i) the repeal, amendment, or modification of Section 382 (and any comparable successor provision) of the Internal Revenue Code, in a manner that renders the restrictions imposed by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code no longer applicable to PG&#38;E Corporation, (ii) the beginning of a taxable year in which the Board of Directors of PG&#38;E Corporation determines that no tax benefits attributable to net operating losses or other tax attributes are available, (iii) the date selected by the Board of Directors if it determines that the limitation amount imposed by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code as of such date in the event of an &#8220;ownership change&#8221; of PG&#38;E Corporation (as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1502-91 et seq.) would not be materially less than the net operating loss carryforwards or &#8220;net unrealized built-in loss&#8221; (within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1502-91 et seq.) of PG&#38;E Corporation, and (iv) the date selected by the Board of Directors if it determines that it is in the best interests of PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s shareholders for the Ownership Restrictions to be removed or released. The Ownership Restrictions may also be waived by the Board of Directors on a case by case basis. 
Because PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have elected to treat the Fire Victim Trust as a grantor trust, the application of the Ownership Restrictions, as defined in PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s Amended Articles of Incorporation, will be determined on the basis of a number of shares outstanding that could differ materially from the number of shares reported as outstanding on the cover page of its periodic reports under the Exchange Act. 
The Plan contemplated that the Fire Victim Trust would be treated as a &#8220;qualified settlement fund&#8221; for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes, subject to PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s ability to elect to treat the Fire Victim Trust as a grantor trust for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes instead. On July 8, 2021, PG&#38;E Corporation, the Utility, ShareCo, and the Fire Victim Trust entered into the Share Exchange and Tax Matters Agreement, pursuant to which PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility made a grantor trust election for the Fire Victim Trust effective retroactively to the inception of the Fire Victim Trust. 
As a result of the grantor trust election, shares of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock owned by the Fire Victim Trust are treated as held by the Utility and, in turn attributed to PG&#38;E Corporation for income tax purposes. Consequently, any shares owned by the Fire Victim Trust are effectively excluded from the total number of outstanding equity securities when calculating a person&#8217;s Percentage Stock Ownership (as defined in the Amended Articles) for purposes of the Ownership Restrictions. See &#8220;Tax Matters&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A for an example of these calculations. PG&#38;E Corporation does not control the number of shares held by the Fire Victim Trust and is not able to determine in advance the number of shares the Fire Victim Trust will hold. PG&#38;E Corporation intends to periodically make available to investors information about the number of shares of common stock held by the Fire Victim Trust, the Utility, and ShareCo as of a specified date for purposes of the Ownership Restrictions, including in its Quarterly Reports and Annual Reports filed with the SEC. 
PG&#38;E Corporation intends to enforce the Ownership Restrictions as described in the foregoing paragraph (calculated as excluding any shares owned by the Fire Victim Trust, the Utility, and ShareCo from the number of outstanding equity securities). All current and prospective shareholders are advised to consider the foregoing in determining their ownership and acquisition of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock. 
PG&#38;E Corporation may not be able to use some or all of its net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset future income. 
As of December 31, 2021, PG&#38;E Corporation had net operating loss carryforwards for PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s consolidated group for U.S. federal and California income tax purposes of approximately $21.1 billion and $18.9 billion, respectively, and PG&#38;E Corporation incurred and may also continue to incur in connection with the Plan significant net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes. The ability of PG&#38;E Corporation to use some or all of these net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be subject to certain limitations. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (which also applies for California state income tax purposes), if a corporation (or a consolidated group) undergoes an &#8220;ownership change,&#8221; such net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may be subject to certain limitations. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain shareholders (generally five percent shareholders, applying certain look-through and aggregation rules) increases by more than 50% over such shareholders&#8217; lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years). 
As of the date of this report, it is more likely than not that PG&#38;E Corporation has not undergone an ownership change and its net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes are not limited by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. However, whether PG&#38;E Corporation underwent or will undergo an ownership change as a result of the transactions in PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s equity that occurred pursuant to the Plan depends on several factors outside PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s control and the application of certain laws that are uncertain in several respects. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS would not successfully assert that PG&#38;E Corporation has undergone or will undergo an ownership change pursuant to the Plan. In addition, even if these transactions did not cause an ownership change, they may increase the likelihood that PG&#38;E Corporation may undergo an ownership change in the future. If the IRS successfully asserts that PG&#38;E Corporation did undergo, or PG&#38;E Corporation otherwise does undergo, an ownership change, the limitation on its net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code could be material to PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
In particular, limitations imposed on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes could cause U.S. federal and California income taxes to be paid earlier than would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes. In addition, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards is critical to a successful rate-neutral securitization transaction and to PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s commitment to make certain operating and capital expenditures. Failure to consummate a securitization transaction or obtain alternative sources of capital could have a material adverse effect on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility and the value of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s ability to pay dividends on shares of its common stock is subject to restrictions. 
Pursuant to the Confirmation Order, PG&#38;E Corporation may not pay dividends on shares of its common stock until it recognizes $ 6.2 billion in Non-GAAP Core Earnings following the Emergence Date. &#8220;Non-GAAP Core Earnings&#8221; means GAAP earnings adjusted for certain non-core items. 
Subject to the foregoing restrictions, any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant. 
PG&#38;E Corporation is a holding company and relies on dividends, distributions and other payments, advances, and transfers of funds from the Utility to meet its obligations. 
PG&#38;E Corporation conducts its operations primarily through its subsidiary, the Utility, and substantially all of PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s consolidated assets are held by the Utility. Accordingly, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s cash flow and its ability to meet its debt service obligations under its existing and future indebtedness are largely dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of the Utility and the distribution or other payment of these earnings and cash flows to PG&#38;E Corporation in the form of dividends or loans or advances and repayment of loans and advances from the Utility. The ability of the Utility to pay dividends or make other advances, distributions, and transfers of funds will depend on its results of operations and may be restricted by, among other things, applicable laws limiting the amount of funds available for payment of dividends and certain restrictive covenants contained in the agreements of those subsidiaries. Additionally, the Utility must use its resources to satisfy its own obligations, including its obligation to serve customers, to pay principal and interest on outstanding debt, to pay preferred stock dividends, and to meet its obligations to employees and creditors, before it can distribute cash to PG&#38;E Corporation. Under the Utility&#8217;s Articles of Incorporation, the Utility cannot pay common stock dividends unless all cumulative preferred dividends on the Utility&#8217;s preferred stock have been paid. As of January 31, 2022, there were $ 59.1 million of such cumulative and unpaid dividends on the Utility&#8217;s preferred stock. In addition, the CPUC has imposed various conditions that govern the relationship between PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility, including financial conditions that require the Board of Directors to give first priority to the capital requirements of the Utility, as determined to be necessary and prudent to meet the Utility&#8217;s obligation to serve or to operate the Utility in a prudent and efficient manner. On February 8, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Utility authorized the payment of all cumulative and unpaid dividends on the Utility&#8217;s preferred stock as of January 31, 2022 totaling $ 59.1 million, payable on May 13, 2022, to holders of record on April 29, 2022 and declared a dividend on the Utility&#8217;s preferred stock totaling $ 3.5 million that will be accrued during the three-month period ending April 30, 2022, payable on May 15, 2022, to holders of record on April 29, 2022. It is uncertain when PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility will commence the payment of dividends on their common stock. The deterioration of income from, or other available assets of, the Utility for any reason could limit or impair the Utility&#8217;s ability to pay dividends or other distributions to PG&#38;E Corporation, which could, in turn, materially and adversely affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s ability to meet its obligations. 
California law and certain provisions in the Amended Articles and the amended and restated bylaws of PG&#38;E Corporation (the &#8220;Amended Bylaws&#8221;) may prevent efforts by shareholders to change the direction or management of PG&#38;E Corporation. 
The Amended Articles and the Amended Bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of PG&#38;E Corporation more difficult without the approval of the Board of Directors, including the following: 
These and other provisions in the Amended Articles, the Amended Bylaws, and California law could make it more difficult for shareholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of the Board of Directors or initiate actions that are opposed by the then-current Board of Directors, including delaying or impeding merger, tender offer, or proxy contest involving PG&#38;E Corporation. The existence of these provisions could negatively affect the price of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock and limit opportunities for shareholders to realize value in a corporate transaction. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows have been and could continue to be significantly affected by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows have been (beginning in March 2020) and could continue to be significantly affected by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (and its variants), but the extent of such impact is uncertain. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility continue to evaluate the impact of the current COVID-19 outbreak on their business and financial results. The consequences of a continued and prolonged outbreak and resulting governmental and regulatory orders have had and could continue to have a negative impact on the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic conditions, and resulting decrease in economic and industrial activity in the Utility&#8217;s service territory, have and will continue to have a significant adverse impact on the Utility&#8217;s customers. These circumstances have impacted and will continue to impact the Utility for a period of time that PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict. For example, the economic downturn has resulted in a reduction in customer receipts and collection delays throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The Utility&#8217;s accounts receivable balances over 30 days outstanding as of December 31, 2021 were approximately $1.1 billion, or $832 million higher as compared to the balances as of December 31, 2019. The Utility is unable to estimate the portion of the increase directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Utility expects to continue experiencing an impact on monthly cash collections for as long as current COVID-19 circumstances persist. 
On January 1, 2021, electric rates were reset using sales that were adjusted for the COVID-19 pandemic impacts and significant ongoing shortfalls are not currently expected in 2021. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are currently unable to quantify the long-term potential impact of the changes in customer collections or changes in energy demand on earnings and cash flows due, in part, to uncertainties regarding the timing, duration and intensity of the COVID-19 outbreak and the resulting economic downturn. Although the CPUC authorized the establishment of memorandum and balancing accounts to track costs associated with customer protection measures, the timing of regulatory relief, if any, and ultimate cost recovery from such accounts or otherwise, are uncertain. 
The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic downturn have resulted and will continue to result in workforce disruptions, both in personnel availability (including a reduction in contract labor resources) and deployment. Increased governmental regulation of the COVID-19 pandemic protections, including vaccination mandates or testing requirement for workers, could result in employee attrition, workforce disruptions and increased supplier and contractor costs. 
Although the Utility continues to prioritize customer and community safety, these disruptions necessitate changes to the Utility&#8217;s operating and capital expenditure plans, which could lead to project delays or service disruptions in certain programs. Delays in production and shipping of materials used in the Utility&#8217;s operations may also impact operations. 
The Utility has experienced shortages in certain materials, longer lead times and delivery delays as a result of domestic and international raw material and labor shortages. If these disruptions to the supply chain persist or worsen, the Utility may be delayed or prevented from completing planned maintenance and capital projects work. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility expect additional financial impacts in the future as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Potential longer-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility include the potential for higher credit spreads, borrowing costs and incremental financing needs. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s analysis of the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing and subject to change. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict the timing, duration or intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic situation and any resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic and any variant strains of the COVID-19 virus, the effectiveness and intensity of measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic (including availability and effectiveness of vaccines), and the effects of the COVID-19 situation on the business, financial condition and results of operations of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility and on the business and general economic conditions in the State of California and the United States of America. 
Rising rates for the Utility&#8217;s customers could result in circumstances in which the Utility is unable to fully recover costs or earn its authorized ROE. 
The rates paid by the Utility&#8217;s customers are impacted by the Utility&#8217;s costs, commodity prices, and broader energy trends. The Utility&#8217;s capital investment plan, increasing procurement of renewable power and energy storage, increasing environmental regulations, leveling demand, and the cumulative impact of other public policy requirements, collectively place continuing upward pressure on customer rates. In particular, the Utility will need to make substantial, sustained investments to its infrastructure to adapt to climate change. For more information on factors that could cause the Utility&#8217;s costs to increase, see &#8220;The Utility&#8217;s ratemaking and cost recovery proceedings may not authorize sufficient revenues, or the Utility&#8217;s actual costs could exceed its authorized or forecasted costs due to various factors, including if the Utility is not able to manage its costs effectively&#8221; above. If customer rates increase, the CPUC may face greater pressure to approve lesser amounts in the Utility&#8217;s ratemaking or cost recovery proceedings. 
The Utility generally recovers its electricity and natural gas procurement costs through rates as &#8220;pass-through&#8221; costs. Increases in the Utility&#8217;s commodity costs directly impact customer bills. 
Increasing levels of self-generation of electricity by customers (primarily solar installations) and customer enrollment in NEM, which allows self-generating customers to receive bill credits for surplus power at the full retail rate, shifts costs to other customers. Under this structure, NEM customers do not pay their proportionate share of the cost of maintaining and operating the electric transmission and distribution system, subject to certain exceptions, while still receiving electricity from the system when their self-generation is inadequate to meet their electricity needs. These unpaid costs are subsidized by customers not participating in NEM. Accordingly, as more electric customers switch to NEM and self-generate energy, the burden on the remaining customers increases, which in turn encourages more self-generation, further increasing rate pressure on existing non-NEM customers. 
Other long-term trends could also increase costs for gas customers. Natural gas providers are subject to compliance with CARB&#8217;s cap-and-trade program, and natural gas end-use customers have an increasing exposure to carbon costs under the program through 2030 (when the full cost will be reflected in customer bills). CARB may also require aggressive energy efficiency programs to reduce natural gas end use. Increased renewable portfolio standards generation in the electric sector could reduce electric generation gas load. Additionally, customers replacing natural gas appliances with electric appliances will lead to further reduced gas demand. The combination of reduced load and increased costs to maintain the gas system could result in higher natural gas customer bills. In addition, some local city governments have passed ordinances restricting use of natural gas in new construction and, if other jurisdictions follow suit, this could affect future demand for the provision of natural gas. If fewer customers receive gas from the Utility, the Utility&#8217;s gas system maintenance costs, many of which cannot be reduced in the short term even if gas quantities decrease, would be borne by fewer customers. Finally, a potential mandate to purchase renewable natural gas for core customers could lead to cost recovery risk if utilities are competing with the transportation sector without receiving the same incentives. 
A confluence of technology-related cost declines and sustained federal or state subsidies could make a combination of distributed generation and energy storage a viable, cost-effective alternative to the Utility&#8217;s bundled electric service which could further reduce energy demand. Reduced energy demand or significantly slowed growth in demand due to customer migration to other energy providers, adoption of energy efficient technology, conservation, increasing levels of distributed generation and self-generation, unless substantially offset through regulatory cost allocations, could increase the energy rates for other customers. 
If rates were to rise too rapidly, customer usage could decline. This decline would decrease the volume of sales, among which the Utility&#8217;s fixed costs are allocated, and increase rates. 
To relieve some of this upward rate pressure, the CPUC may authorize lower revenues than the Utility requested or increase the period over which the Utility is allowed to recover amounts, which could impact the Utility&#8217;s ability to timely recover its operating costs. The Utility&#8217;s level of authorized capital investment could decline as well, leading to a slower growth in rate base and earnings. As a result, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
General Risk Factors 
The Utility may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel and senior management talent, or prolonged labor disruptions may occur. 
The Utility&#8217;s workforce is aging, and many employees are or will become eligible to retire within the next few years. Although the Utility has undertaken efforts to recruit and train new field service personnel, the Utility may be faced with a shortage of experienced and qualified personnel. The majority of the Utility&#8217;s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with three unions. Labor disruptions could occur depending on the outcome of negotiations to renew the terms of these agreements with the unions or if tentative new agreements are not ratified by their members. In addition, some of the remaining non-represented Utility employees could join one of these unions in the future. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility also may face challenges in attracting and retaining senior management talent especially if they are unable to restore the reputational harm generated by the negative publicity stemming from the ongoing enforcement proceedings and the Chapter 11 Cases. Any such occurrences could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. For more information about labor disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see &#8220;PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows have been and could continue to be significantly affected by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic&#8221; above.

PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results can be affected by many factors, including estimates and assumptions used in the critical accounting policies described in MD&#38;A, that can cause their actual financial results to differ materially from historical results or from anticipated future financial results. The following discussion of key risk factors should be considered in evaluating an investment in PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility and should be read in conjunction with MD&#38;A and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this 2020 Form 10-K. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.

Risks Related to Post-Chapter 11 Environment and Financial Condition 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s substantial indebtedness following the emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases may adversely affect their financial health and operating flexibility. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have a substantial amount of indebtedness as a result of the reorganization transactions in connection with implementation of the Plan, most of which is secured by liens on certain assets of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility. As of December 31, 2020, PG&#38;E Corporation had approximately $4.71 billion of outstanding indebtedness (such indebtedness consisting of the 2028 Notes, the 2030 Notes and borrowings under the PG&#38;E Corporation Term Loan), and the Utility had approximately $31.9 billion of outstanding indebtedness (such indebtedness including the Utility Reinstated Senior Notes, the New Utility Senior Notes, the Mortgage Bonds, and the Utility Term Loan Credit Agreement). In addition, PG&#38;E Corporation had $500 million of additional borrowing capacity under the Corporation Revolving Credit Agreement, and the Utility had $1.9 billion of additional borrowing capacity under the Utility Revolving Credit Agreement. In addition, the Utility had outstanding preferred stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of $252 million. 
Since PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have a high level of debt, a substantial portion of cash flow from operations will be used to make payments on this debt. Furthermore, since a significant percentage of the Utility&#8217;s assets are used to secure its debt, this reduces the amount of collateral available for future secured debt or credit support and reduces its flexibility in operating these secured assets. This relatively high level of debt and related security could have other important consequences for PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility, including: 
Under the terms of the agreements and indentures governing their respective indebtedness, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are permitted to incur additional indebtedness, some of which could be secured (subject to compliance with certain tests) and which could further accentuate these risks. As a result of the high level of indebtedness, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility may be unable to generate sufficient cash through operations to service such debt, and may need to refinance such indebtedness at or prior to maturity and be unable to obtain financing on suitable terms or at all, any of which could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s business, financial condition and results of operations. 
The documents that govern PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s indebtedness contain restrictions that limit their flexibility in operating their business. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s material financing agreements, including certain of their respective credit agreements and indentures, contain various covenants restricting, among other things, their ability to: 
The restrictions contained in these material financing agreements could affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to operate their business and may limit their ability to react to market conditions or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. For example, such restrictions could adversely affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to finance their operations and expenditures, make strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances, sell assets, restructure their organization or finance their capital needs. Additionally, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond their control, including, but not limited to, prevailing regulatory, economic, financial and industry conditions. 
Parties have appealed the Confirmation Order. 
Following entry of the Confirmation Order confirming the Plan, certain parties filed notices of appeal with respect to the Confirmation Order. While a number of such appeals have been dismissed, there can be no assurance that any of the remaining appeals will not be successful and, if successful, that any such appeal would not have a material adverse effect on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility. 
PG&#38;E Corporation may be required to issue shares with respect to HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims, which would result in dilution to holders of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock, or pay a material amount of cash with respect to allowed Subordinated Debt Claims. 
On the Effective Date, PG&#38;E Corporation issued to the Fire Victim Trust a number of shares of common stock equal to 22.19% of the outstanding common stock on such date. As further described in &#8220;Satisfaction of HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims and Subordinated Debt Claims&#8221; in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, PG&#38;E Corporation may be required to issue shares of its common stock in satisfaction of allowed HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims. If such issuance is required, it may be determined that, under the Plan, the Fire Victim Trust should receive additional shares of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock such that it would have owned 22.19% of the outstanding common stock of reorganized PG&#38;E Corporation on the Effective Date, assuming that such issuance of shares in satisfaction of the HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims had occurred on the Effective Date. Any such issuances will result in dilution to anyone who holds shares of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock prior to such issuance and may cause the trading price of PG&#38;E Corporation shares to decline. 
Additionally, PG&#38;E Corporation may be required to pay a material amount of cash with respect to allowed Subordinated Debt Claims (as defined in &#8220;Satisfaction of HoldCo Rescission or Damage Claims and Subordinated Debt Claims&#8221; in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8). Such payment may have a material adverse impact on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
Any substantial sale of stock by existing stockholders could depress the market value of PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s common stock, thereby devaluing the market price and causing investors to risk losing all or part of their investment. 
Certain existing stockholders, including the Fire Victim Trust, the PIPE Investors and the Backstop Parties, hold a large number of the outstanding shares of PG&#38;E Corporation. PG&#38;E Corporation can make no prediction as to the effect, if any, that sales of shares, or the availability of shares for future sale, will have on the prevailing market price of shares of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of shares of common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could depress prevailing market prices for such shares. Such sales may also make it more difficult for PG&#38;E Corporation to sell equity securities or equity-linked securities in the future at a time and price which it deems appropriate. 
PG&#38;E Corporation may also sell additional shares of common stock in subsequent offerings or issue additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into shares of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock. The issuance of any shares of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock in future financings, acquisitions upon conversion or exercise of convertible securities, or otherwise may result in a reduction of the book value and market price of PG&#38;E Corporation's outstanding common stock. If PG&#38;E Corporation issues any such additional shares, the issuance will cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of all current shareholders. PG&#38;E Corporation cannot predict the size of future issuances of shares of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock or securities convertible into shares of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock or, for any issuance, the effect, if any, that such future issuances will have on the market price of PG&#38;E Corporation's common stock. 
PG&#38;E Corporation common stock is subject to ownership and transfer restrictions intended to preserve PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes. 
PG&#38;E Corporation has incurred and may also continue to incur in connection with the Plan significant net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes, the amount and availability of which are subject to certain qualifications, limitations and uncertainties. The Amended Articles (as defined below) impose certain restrictions on the transferability and ownership of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock and preferred stock (together, the &#8220;capital stock&#8221;) and other interests designated as &#8220;stock&#8221; of PG&#38;E Corporation by the Board of Directors as disclosed in an SEC filing (such stock and other interests, the &#8220;Equity Securities,&#8221; and such restrictions on transferability and ownership, the &#8220;Ownership Restrictions&#8221;) in order to reduce the possibility of an equity ownership shift that could result in limitations on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes from prior taxable years or periods for federal income tax purposes. Any acquisition of PG&#38;E Corporation capital stock that results in a shareholder being in violation of these restrictions may not be valid. 
Subject to certain exceptions, the Ownership Restrictions restrict (i) any person or entity (including certain groups of persons) from directly or indirectly acquiring or accumulating 4.75% or more of the outstanding Equity Securities and (ii) the ability of any person or entity (including certain groups of persons) already owning, directly or indirectly, 4.75% or more of the Equity Securities to increase their proportionate interest in the Equity Securities (but see the immediately following risk factor for more information). Any transferee receiving Equity Securities that would result in a violation of the Ownership Restrictions will not be recognized as a shareholder of PG&#38;E Corporation or entitled to any rights of shareholders, including, without limitation, the right to vote and to receive dividends or distributions, whether liquidating or otherwise, in each case, with respect to the Equity Securities causing the violation. 
The Ownership Restrictions remain in effect until the earliest of (i) the repeal, amendment or modification of Section 382 (and any comparable successor provision) of the Internal Revenue Code, in a manner that renders the restrictions imposed by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code no longer applicable to PG&#38;E Corporation, (ii) the beginning of a taxable year in which the Board of Directors of PG&#38;E Corporation determines that no tax benefits attributable to net operating losses or other tax attributes are available, (iii) the date selected by the Board of Directors if it determines that the limitation amount imposed by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code as of such date in the event of an &#8220;ownership change&#8221; of PG&#38;E Corporation (as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1502-91 et seq.) would not be materially less than the net operating loss carryforwards or &#8220;net unrealized built-in loss&#8221; (within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1502-91 et seq.) of PG&#38;E Corporation and (iv) the date selected by the Board of Directors if it determines that it is in the best interests of PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s shareholders for the Ownership Restrictions to be removed or released. The Ownership Restrictions may also be waived by the Board of Directors on a case by case basis. 
If PG&#38;E Corporation elects to treat the Fire Victim Trust as a &#8220;grantor trust,&#8221; the application of the Ownership Restrictions, as defined in PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s Amended Articles of Incorporation, will be determined on the basis of a number of shares outstanding that could differ materially from the number of shares reported as outstanding on the cover page of its periodic reports under the Exchange Act. 
The Plan contemplates that the Fire Victim Trust will be treated as a &#8220;qualified settlement fund&#8221; for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s ability to elect to treat the Fire Victim Trust as a &#8220;grantor trust&#8221; for U.S. federal income tax purposes instead. In January 2021, PG&#38;E Corporation received an IRS ruling that states the Utility is eligible to make a grantor trust election with respect to the Fire Victim Trust and addressed certain, but not all, related issues. PG&#38;E Corporation believes benefits associated with &#8220;grantor trust&#8221; treatment could be realized, but only if PG&#38;E Corporation and the Fire Victim Trust can meet certain requirements of the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulations thereunder, relating to sales of PG&#38;E Corporation stock. 
If PG&#38;E Corporation were to elect to treat the Fire Victim Trust as a &#8220;grantor trust,&#8221; any shares owned by the Fire Victim Trust would effectively be excluded from the total number of outstanding Equity Securities when calculating a Person&#8217;s Percentage Ownership (as defined in the Amended Articles) for purposes of the Ownership Restrictions. For example, whereas the number of outstanding shares of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock for corporate purposes as of February 22, 2021, was 1,984,683,820 shares, for purposes of the Ownership Restrictions, the number of outstanding common stock as of February 22, 2021, would be 1,506,940,230 (the number of outstanding shares of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock less the number of shares of common stock owned by the Fire Victim Trust as of February 22, 2021). PG&#38;E Corporation does not control the number of shares held by the Fire Victim Trust and is not able to determine in advance the number of shares the Fire Victim Trust will hold. PG&#38;E Corporation intends to periodically make available to investors information about the number of shares of common stock held by the Fire Victim Trust as of a specified date for purposes of the Ownership Restrictions, including in its Quarterly Reports and Annual Reports filed with the SEC. 
PG&#38;E Corporation expects to publicly announce its determination on whether it will elect to treat the Fire Victim Trust as a &#8220;grantor trust&#8221; no later than April 1, 2021. In the event PG&#38;E Corporation decides to make a &#8220;grantor trust&#8221; election with respect to the Fire Victim Trust, PG&#38;E Corporation intends to enforce the Ownership Restrictions as described in the foregoing paragraph (excluding any shares owned by the Fire Victim Trust from the number of outstanding Equity Securities), including with respect to Transfers (as defined in the Amended Articles) occurring before such announcement. However, it is anticipated that the Board of Directors of PG&#38;E Corporation will exempt Transfers to shareholders occurring prior to July 30, 2020 (the date PG&#38;E Corporation initially announced it was considering treating the Fire Victim Trust as a grantor trust in its Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2020), solely to the extent that such Transfers would have complied with the Ownership Restrictions if the Ownership Restrictions were applied on the basis that the shares owned by the Fire Victim Trust were treated as outstanding Equity Securities. For the avoidance of doubt, all other Transfers of Equity Securities (including acquisitions from and after the July 30, 2020 by shareholders benefiting from an exemption described in the preceding sentence) will continue to be subject to the Ownership Restrictions. All current and prospective shareholders are advised to consider the foregoing in determining their ownership and acquisition of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock. 
The ability of PG&#38;E Corporation to use some or all of its net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset future income may be limited. 
As of December 31, 2020, PG&#38;E Corporation had net operating loss carryforwards for PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s consolidated group for U.S. federal and California income tax purposes of approximately $28.5 billion and $25.4 billion, respectively, and PG&#38;E Corporation incurred and may also continue to incur in connection with the Plan significant net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes. The ability of PG&#38;E Corporation to use some or all of these net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be subject to certain limitations. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (which also applies for California state income tax purposes), if a corporation (or a consolidated group) undergoes an &#8220;ownership change,&#8221; such net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may be subject to certain limitations. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain shareholders (generally five percent shareholders, applying certain look-through and aggregation rules) increases by more than 50% over such shareholders&#8217; lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years). 
As of the date of this report, it is more likely than not that PG&#38;E Corporation has not undergone an ownership change and its net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes are not limited by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. However, whether PG&#38;E Corporation underwent or will undergo an ownership change as a result of the transactions in PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s equity that occurred pursuant to the Plan depends on several factors outside PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s control and the application of certain laws that are uncertain in several respects. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS would not successfully assert that PG&#38;E Corporation has undergone or will undergo an ownership change pursuant to the Plan. In addition, even if these transactions did not cause an ownership change, they may increase the likelihood that PG&#38;E Corporation may undergo an ownership change in the future. If the IRS successfully asserts that PG&#38;E Corporation did undergo, or PG&#38;E Corporation otherwise does undergo, an ownership change, the limitation on its net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code could be material to its operations. 
In particular, limitations imposed on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes could cause U.S. federal and California income taxes to be paid earlier than would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes. Specifically, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards is critical to a successful rate-neutral securitization transaction, the proceeds of which are expected to be used to satisfy the Utility&#8217;s obligations to the Fire Victim Trust, and to PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s commitment to make certain operating and capital expenditures. Failure to consummate a securitization transaction or obtain alternative sources of capital could have a material adverse effect on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility and the value of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock. 
The ability of PG&#38;E Corporation to pay dividends on shares of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock is subject to restrictions. 
In response to concerns raised by the California Governor, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility filed the Case Resolution Contingency Process Motion with the Bankruptcy Court setting forth certain commitments in connection with the confirmation process and implementation of the Plan, including, among other things, limitations on the ability of PG&#38;E Corporation to pay dividends on shares of its common stock (the &#8220;Dividend Restriction&#8221;). The Dividend Restriction provides that PG&#38;E Corporation may not pay dividends on shares of its common stock until it recognizes $6.2 billion in Non-GAAP Core Earnings following the Effective Date. &#8220;Non-GAAP Core Earnings&#8221; means GAAP earnings adjusted for certain non-core items. Additionally, the ruling of the court overseeing the Utility&#8217;s probation dated April 3, 2019 places further restrictions on the ability of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility to issue dividends. Under those terms of probation, no dividends may be issued until the Utility is fully in compliance with all applicable laws concerning vegetation management and clearance requirements, as well as the vegetation management and enhanced vegetation management targets and metrics in the Utility&#8217;s WMP. 
Subject to the foregoing restrictions, any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant. 
PG&#38;E Corporation is a holding company and relies on dividends, distributions and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from the Utility to meet its obligations. 
PG&#38;E Corporation conducts its operations primarily through its subsidiary, the Utility, and substantially all of PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s consolidated assets are held by the Utility. Accordingly, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s cash flow and its ability to meet its debt service obligations under its existing and future indebtedness are largely dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of the Utility and the distribution or other payment of these earnings and cash flows to PG&#38;E Corporation in the form of dividends or loans or advances and repayment of loans and advances from the Utility. The ability of the Utility to pay dividends or make other advances, distributions and transfers of funds will depend on its results of operations and may be restricted by, among other things, applicable laws limiting the amount of funds available for payment of dividends, the conditions of the Utility&#8217;s probation proceeding and certain restrictive covenants contained in the agreements of those subsidiaries. Additionally, the Utility must use its resources to satisfy its own obligations, including its obligation to serve customers, to pay principal and interest on outstanding debt, to pay preferred stock dividends and meet its obligations to employees and creditors, before it can distribute cash to PG&#38;E Corporation. Under the Utility&#8217;s Articles of Incorporation, the Utility cannot pay common stock dividends unless all cumulative preferred dividends on the Utility&#8217;s preferred stock have been paid. In addition, the CPUC has imposed various conditions that govern the relationship between PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility, including financial conditions that require the Board of Directors to give first priority to the capital requirements of the Utility, as determined to be necessary and prudent to meet the Utility&#8217;s obligation to serve or to operate the Utility in a prudent and efficient manner. It is uncertain when PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility will commence the payment of dividends on their common stock and when the Utility will commence the payment of dividends on its preferred stock. The deterioration of income from, or other available assets of, the Utility for any reason could limit or impair the Utility&#8217;s ability to pay dividends or other distributions to PG&#38;E Corporation, which could, in turn, materially and adversely affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s ability to meet its obligations. 
California law and certain provisions in the Amended Articles and the amended and restated bylaws of PG&#38;E Corporation (the &#8220;Amended Bylaws&#8221;) may prevent efforts by shareholders to change the direction or management of the Company. 
The Amended Articles and the Amended Bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of PG&#38;E Corporation more difficult without the approval of the Board of Directors, including, but not limited to, the following: 
These and other provisions in the Amended Articles, the Amended Bylaws and California law could make it more difficult for shareholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of the Board of Directors or initiate actions that are opposed by the then-current Board of Directors, including delay or impede a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving PG&#38;E Corporation. The existence of these provisions could negatively affect the price of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock and limit opportunities for shareholders to realize value in a corporate transaction. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows have been and could continue to be significantly affected by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows have been (beginning in March 2020) and could continue to be significantly affected by the outbreak of COVID-19, but the extent of such impact is uncertain. In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, resulting in significant disruptions to manufacturing, supply chain, markets, and travel world-wide. On January 30, 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern and on March 12, 2020, announced the outbreak was a pandemic. In response to the California Governor&#8217;s emergency proclamation on March 4, 2020, the Utility extended a disconnection moratorium to residential and small business customers. On April 16, 2020, the CPUC approved a resolution requiring utilities to extend this disconnection moratorium through April 16, 2021. On February 11, 2021, the CPUC extended the moratorium for residential and small business customers to June 30, 2021. On December 21, 2020, a CPUC ALJ issued a ruling seeking comments on an approach to implement a temporary moratorium on service disconnections for medium-large commercial and industrial customers. On February 11, 2021, the CPUC initiated a rulemaking proceeding to consider arrearage relief for utility customers who will have outstanding utility bills when the moratorium on service disconnections ends, some of the costs of which could be funded by shareholders. 
While the extent of the impact of the current COVID-19 outbreak on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s business and financial results is uncertain, the consequences of a continued and prolonged outbreak and resulting government and regulatory orders have had and could continue to have a further negative impact on the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. 
The outbreak of COVID-19 and the resulting economic conditions, including but not limited to the shelter-in-place orders, as such orders may be imposed from time to time, and resulting decrease in economic and industrial activity in the Utility&#8217;s service territory have and will continue to have a significant adverse impact on the Utility&#8217;s customers; these circumstances have impacted and will continue to impact the Utility for a period of time that PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict. For example, the economic downturn has resulted in a reduction in customer receipts and collection delays in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2020. 
The Utility&#8217;s customer energy accounts receivable balances over 30 days outstanding as of December 31, 2020 were approximately $825 million, or $478 million higher as compared to the balances as of December 31, 2019. The Utility is unable to estimate the portion of the increase directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Utility expects to continue experiencing an impact on monthly cash collections in 2021 and for as long as current COVID-19 circumstances persist. 
On April 16, 2020, the CPUC passed a resolution requiring COVID-19 related emergency customer protection measures starting from the March 4, 2020 Emergency Proclamation and consistent with the March 16, 2020 Executive Order, through April 16, 2021. On February 11, 2021, the CPUC approved a resolution extending these protections to June 30, 2021. The April 16, 2020 resolution allows associated costs to be tracked in a memorandum account, the CPPMA. The CPPMA allows tracking of residential and small business customers&#8217; incremental uncollectible costs. It is anticipated that implementation of the February 11, 2021 resolution will provide for the same treatment. In addition, the Utility&#8217;s 2020 GRC final decision would continue the Utility&#8217;s existing mechanism to address uncollectibles, which allows the Utility to readjust its uncollectibles rate on an annual basis based on the most recent 10-year average of uncollectibles. In addition, the June 11, 2020 decision in the OIR to Consider New Approaches to Disconnections and Reconnections to Improve Energy Access and Contain Costs (Disconnections OIR) provides for a two-way balancing account for residential uncollectibles and memorandum account for OIR implementation costs. The Utility is unable to predict whether these measures will allow for future recovery of these amounts. 
In addition, the Utility has experienced average reductions of approximately two percent in electric load and approximately two percent in core gas load on a weather-adjusted basis from mid-March 2020 through December 2020, resulting in an estimated $430 million reduction in billed revenues for the mid-March 2019 to the December 2020 period. On January 1, 2021, electric rates were reset using sales that were adjusted for COVID-19 impacts and significant ongoing shortfalls are not currently expected in 2021. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are currently unable to quantify the long-term potential impact of the changes in customer collections or changes in energy demand on earnings and cash flows due, in part, to uncertainties regarding the timing, duration and intensity of the COVID-19 outbreak and the resulting economic downturn. Although the CPUC authorized the establishment of memorandum and balancing accounts to track costs associated with customer protection measures, the timing of regulatory relief, if any, and ultimately cost recovery from such accounts or otherwise, are uncertain. 
The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic downturn have resulted and will continue to result in workforce disruptions, both in personnel availability (including a reduction in contract labor resources) and deployment. In preparation for the return of a few teams to their offices, the Utility has issued a &#8220;Return to PG&#38;E Playbook&#8221; that explains the safety-related steps the company is taking, as well as the steps that PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s employees should take. The guidance includes important reminders of policies on personal hygiene, travel, reporting exposure or illness, and other topics. 
Although the Utility continues to prioritize customer and community safety, these disruptions necessitate changes to the Utility&#8217;s operating and capital expenditure plans, which could lead to project delays or service disruptions in certain programs. Delays in production and shipping of materials used in the Utility&#8217;s operations may also impact operations. 
In addition, as discussed above, a group of local government entities and organizations filed a Joint Motion asking the CPUC to require utilities to comply with additional requirements when implementing PSPS events while local areas are sheltering-in-place due to COVID-19. The requested requirements included providing back-up generation to essential services and allowing local governments to veto PSPS events for their areas. The Utility and other entities (including the other IOUs) filed responses on April 20, 2020, requesting that the CPUC deny the motion, and the moving parties and other entities filed responses on April 24, 2020. On August 24, 2020, the ALJ issued a decision holding the April 13, 2020 joint motion in abeyance, finding that the May 28, 2020 decision dealt with many of the issues raised. If the motion were reinstated in the future, a CPUC decision could restrict or impose additional requirements on the Utility in implementing PSPS events. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility expect additional financial impacts in the future as a result of COVID-19. Potential longer-term impacts of COVID-19 on PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility include the potential for higher credit spreads and borrowing costs and incremental financing needs. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s analysis of the potential impact of COVID-19 is ongoing and subject to change. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict the timing, duration or intensity of the COVID-19 situation, the timing, duration or intensity of any resurgence of COVID-19 and any variant strains of the COVID-19 virus, the effectiveness and intensity of measures to contain COVID-19 (including availability and effectiveness of vaccines), and the effects of the COVID-19 situation on the business, financial condition and results of operations of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility and on the business and general economic conditions in the State of California and the United States of America. 
Risks Related to Wildfires 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected if the Utility does not maintain an AB 1054 safety certification or is otherwise unable to access the Wildfire Fund. 
On January 14, 2021, the WSD issued the Utility&#8217;s 2020 Safety Certification, which under AB 1054 entitles the Utility to certain benefits, including eligibility for a cap on Wildfire Fund reimbursement and for a reformed prudent manager standard. The 2020 Safety Certification is valid for 12 months, or until a timely request for a new safety certification is acted upon, whichever occurs later. 
The AB 1054 Wildfire Fund disallowance cap, which caps the amount of liability that the Utility could be required to bear for a catastrophic wildfire, is inapplicable if the Wildfire Fund administrator determines that the electric utility company&#8217;s actions or inactions that resulted in the applicable wildfire constituted &#8220;conscious or willful disregard for the rights and safety of others,&#8221; or the electric utility company fails to maintain a valid safety certification at the time the applicable wildfire ignited. The inability to maintain an AB 1054 safety certification and, as a result, the inaccessibility of the disallowance cap on reimbursement to the Wildfire Fund, could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. In addition, if the Utility has failed to maintain a valid safety certificate at the time a wildfire ignites, the initial burden of proof in a prudency proceeding shifts from intervenors to the Utility. 
Furthermore, the Wildfire Fund will only be available for payment of eligible claims so long as there are sufficient funds remaining in the Wildfire Fund. Such funds could be depleted more quickly than expected, including as a result of claims made by California&#8217;s other participating electric utility companies. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility will not benefit from all of the features of AB 1054 if the Wildfire Fund is exhausted, which could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected as a result of the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire or future wildfires. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected as a result of the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire or future wildfires. 
Based on the facts and circumstances available as of the date of this report, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have determined that it is probable they will incur a loss in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire and the 2020 Zogg fire. Although PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have recorded liabilities for probable losses in connection with such wildfires, these liability estimates correspond to the lower end of the range of reasonably estimable losses, do not include several categories of potential damages that are not reasonably estimable, and are subject to change based on new information. 
Although there are a number of unknown facts surrounding Cal Fire&#8217;s causation determination of the 2019 Kincade fire and Cal Fire&#8217;s investigation of the 2020 Zogg fire, the Utility could be subject to significant liability in excess of insurance coverage or amounts available under the Wildfire Fund under AB 1054 that would be expected to have a material impact on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have also received and have responded or are responding to data requests from the CPUC&#8217;s SED relating to the 2019 Kincade fire and the 2020 Zogg fire. Furthermore, the Sonoma County District Attorney&#8217;s Office and the Shasta County District Attorney&#8217;s Office are conducting investigations into the 2019 Kincade fire and the 2020 Zogg fire, respectively. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility could be the subject of additional investigations, lawsuits, or enforcement actions in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire or future wildfires. 
Although the Utility has taken extensive measures to reduce the threat of future wildfires, the potential that the Utility&#8217;s equipment will be involved in the ignition of future wildfires, including catastrophic wildfires, is significant. This risk may be attributable to, and exacerbated by, a variety of factors, including climate (in particular extended periods of seasonal dryness coupled with periods of high wind velocities and other storms), infrastructure, and vegetation conditions. See &#8220;Risks related to environmental factors&#8212;Severe weather conditions, extended drought and shifting climate patterns could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.&#8221; Despite significant investment in mitigation measures to improve infrastructure and manage vegetation, as well as implementation of de-energization strategies, the Utility may not be successful in mitigating the risk of future wildfires. 
In addition, the 2019 Kincade fire and the 2020 Zogg fire have had and, along with any future wildfires could continue to have adverse consequences on the Utility&#8217;s probation proceeding, the Utility&#8217;s proceedings with the CPUC and the FERC (including the Safety Culture OII), and future regulatory proceedings, including future applications for the safety certification required by AB 1054. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility may also suffer additional reputational harm and face an even more challenging operating, political, and regulatory environment as a result of the 2019 Kincade fire, 2020 Zogg fire or any future wildfires. For more information about the 2019 Kincade fire and the 2020 Zogg fire, see Note 14 &#8220;Wildfire-Related Contingencies&#8221; in Part II, Item 8. 
If the Utility is unable to recover all or a significant portion of its excess costs in connection with the 2020 Zogg fire and 2019 Kincade fire through ratemaking mechanisms and in a timely manner, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
The Utility could incur substantial costs in excess of insurance coverage in the future in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire and the 2020 Zogg fire. 
There can be no assurance that the Utility will be allowed to recover costs in excess of insurance, including costs recorded in those accounts in the future, even if a court decision were to determine that the Utility is liable as a result of the application of the doctrine of inverse condemnation. 
The inability to recover all or a significant portion of costs in excess of insurance through increases in rates and by collecting such rates in a timely manner could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The doctrine of inverse condemnation, if applied by courts in litigation to which PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility are subject, could significantly expand the potential liabilities from such litigation and materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
California law includes a doctrine of inverse condemnation that is routinely invoked in California. Inverse condemnation imposes strict liability (including liability for attorneys&#8217; fees) for damages as a result of the design, construction and maintenance of utility facilities, including utilities&#8217; electric transmission lines. Courts have imposed liability under the doctrine of inverse condemnation in legal actions brought by property holders against utilities on the grounds that losses borne by the person whose property was damaged through a public use undertaking should be spread across the community that benefitted from such undertaking, and based on the assumption that utilities have the ability to recover these costs from their customers. Plaintiffs have asserted and continue to assert the doctrine of inverse condemnation in lawsuits related to certain wildfires that occurred in the Utility&#8217;s service territory, including the 2019 Kincade fire and the 2020 Zogg fire. While the Utility currently continues to dispute the applicability of inverse condemnation to the Utility, there can be no assurance that the Utility will be successful in challenging the applicability of inverse condemnation in the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire or other litigation against PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility. 
For example, a court could determine that the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies even in the absence of an open CPUC proceeding for cost recovery, or before a potential cost recovery decision is issued by the CPUC. Although the imposition of liability under the doctrine of inverse condemnation is premised on the assumption that utilities have the ability to automatically recover these costs from their customers, there can be no assurance that the CPUC would authorize cost recovery whether or not a previous court decision had imposed liability on a utility under the doctrine of inverse condemnation. (In December 2017, the CPUC denied recovery of costs that San Diego Gas &#38; Electric Company stated it had incurred as a result of the doctrine of inverse condemnation, holding that the inverse condemnation principles of strict liability are not relevant to the CPUC&#8217;s prudent manager standard. That determination was challenged by San Diego Gas &#38; Electric as well as by the Utility and Southern California Edison. In October 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the case, effectively ending the challenge.) 
If PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility were to be found liable for damages under the doctrine of inverse condemnation, but the Utility was unable to secure a cost recovery decision from the CPUC to pay for such costs through increases in rates or to collect such rates in a timely manner, the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility would be materially affected by potential losses resulting from the impact of the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire or any future wildfires. (See &#8220;PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected as a result of the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire or future wildfires.&#8221; above.) 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected as a result of the Utility&#8217;s implementation of its PSPS program. 
As outlined in the 2020 WMP, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have adopted the PSPS program to proactively de-energize lines that traverse areas under elevated and extreme risks for wildfire when forecasts predict extreme fire-threat conditions. The Utility carried out nine PSPS events in 2019 and six in 2020. In addition to the 2019 and 2020 PSPS events, the Utility expects that PSPS events will be necessary in 2021 and future years. 
These PSPS events have been subject to significant scrutiny and criticism by various stakeholders, including the California Governor, the CPUC and the court overseeing the Utility&#8217;s probation. The Utility also is the subject of a scrutiny by the CPUC and of a class action litigation in connection with the 2019 PSPS events that was filed in the Bankruptcy Court in December of 2019. On August 14, 2020, the assigned ALJ issued a scoping memo and ruling in the 2019 ERRA Compliance proceeding that established a Phase II of the proceeding to address the impacts of PSPS events that occurred in the Utility&#8217;s service territory in 2019 and how the PSPS impacted its revenue collections. To date, the assigned ALJ has not initiated the Phase II. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility cannot predict the timing and outcome of the various proceedings and litigation in connection with the PSPS events. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility could be subject to additional investigations, regulatory proceedings or other enforcement actions as well as to additional litigation and claims by customers as a result of the Utility&#8217;s implementation of its PSPS program, which could result in fines, penalties, customer rebates or other payments. The amount of any fines, penalties, customer rebates or other payments (if PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility were to issue any credits, rebates or other payments in connection with any other PSPS events (whether past events or in the future)) or liability for damages could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. In addition, the PSPS program has had an adverse impact on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s reputation with customers, regulators and policymakers and future PSPS events may increase these negative perceptions. (For more information, see &#8220;Regulatory Matters&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A). 
Risks Related to the Outcome of Other Enforcement Matters, Investigations, and Regulatory Proceedings 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected in the event of further non-compliance with the terms of probation or in the event of further modifications to the conditions of probation. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected in the event of further non-compliance with the terms of probation or in the event of further modifications to the conditions of probation. On January 26, 2017, following the federal criminal trial against the Utility in connection with the San Bruno explosion, in which the Utility was found guilty on six felony counts, the Utility was sentenced to, among other things, a five-year corporate probation period and oversight by a third-party monitor for a period of five years, with the ability to apply for early termination after three years. 
From 2018 to 2020, the court overseeing the Utility&#8217;s probation issued various orders related to the Utility&#8217;s probation, including a finding that the Utility had violated a condition of its probation with respect to reporting requirements, and imposing new conditions of probation. For more information about the Utility&#8217;s probation and the court&#8217;s orders, see &#8220;Enforcement Matters&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A. 
The Utility could incur material costs, not recoverable through rates, in the event of further non-compliance with the terms of its probation and in connection with the monitorship (including but not limited to costs resulting from recommendations of the third-party monitor). The Utility could also incur material costs, not recoverable through rates, in the event of further modifications to the conditions of its probation, such as those proposed by the court overseeing the Utility&#8217;s probation on December 29, 2020 and February 4, 2021, relating to de-energizing certain distribution circuits during PSPS events based on the presence of certain vegetation, and on February 18, 2021, relating to removing all trees or portions thereof, without regard to their health, if they are leaning towards a distribution line and could either fall on the line or contact the line from the side. 
The outcome of probation could harm the Utility&#8217;s relationships with customers, regulators, legislators, communities, business partners, or other constituencies and make it more difficult to recruit qualified personnel and senior management. Further, it could negatively affect the outcome of future ratemaking and regulatory proceedings and result in increased regulatory or legislative scrutiny, including with respect to various aspects of how the Utility&#8217;s business is conducted or organized. (See &#8220;Enforcement and Litigation Matters&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A.) 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected as a result of an Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Process. 
On November 24, 2020, the Utility received a letter (the &#8220;Letter&#8221;) from the President of the CPUC, expressing concerns related to the Utility&#8217;s vegetation management and asset management activities and explaining potential implications with respect to the Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Process adopted by the CPUC in its decision approving PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s Plan, as well as the Utility&#8217;s annual safety certification under AB 1054. According to the Letter, the President of the CPUC has &#8220;directed CPUC staff to conduct fact-finding to determine whether a recommendation to place [the Utility] into the enhanced oversight and enforcement process is warranted.&#8221; On January 14, 2021, the WSD issued the Utility&#8217;s 2020 Safety Certification pursuant to AB 1054. The safety certification is separate from the CPUC&#8217;s enforcement authority and does not preclude the CPUC from pursuing remedies for safety or other applicable violations. 
The Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Process is a six-step process with potentially escalating CPUC oversight and enforcement measures based on specific &#8220;triggering events&#8221; identified for each of the six steps. If the Utility is placed into the Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Process, it will be subject to additional reporting requirements and additional monitoring and oversight by the CPUC. Higher steps of the process (Steps 3-6) also contemplate additional enforcement mechanisms, including appointment of an independent third-party monitor, appointment of a chief restructuring officer, pursuit of the receivership remedy, and review of the Utility&#8217;s Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (i.e., its license to operate as a utility). The process contains provisions for the Utility to cure and exit the process if it can satisfy specific criteria. The Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Process states that the Utility should presumptively move through the steps of the process sequentially, but the CPUC may place the Utility into the appropriate step of the process upon occurrence of a specified triggering event. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected as a result of legislative and regulatory developments. 
Pursuant to Article 5.8 of the Public Utilities Code, on April 30, 2020, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC seeking authorization for a post-emergence transaction to securitize $7.5 billion of 2017 wildfire claims costs that is designed to be rate neutral to customers, with the proceeds used to pay or reimburse the Utility for the payment of wildfire claims costs associated with the 2017 Northern California wildfires. As a result of the proposed transaction, the Utility would retire $6.0 billion of Utility debt and accelerate a $592 million payment due to the Fire Victim Trust. Failure to consummate a securitization transaction could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. (See &#8220;Regulatory Matters - Other Regulatory Proceedings&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A.) 
In addition, the Public Utilities Code requires utilities to submit annual WMPs for approval by the CPUC on a schedule to be established by the CPUC. If the CPUC rejects the Utility&#8217;s WMP submittal, the Utility would become unable to obtain an AB 1054 safety certification and, as a result, become unable to access the Wildfire Fund, which could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. The statute establishes factors to be considered by the CPUC when setting penalties for failure to substantially comply with the plan. Failure to substantially comply with the plan could result in fines and other penalties imposed on the Utility that could be material. (See &#8220;Regulatory Matters &#8211; Other Regulatory Proceedings&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A.) 
On July 12, 2019, the California Governor signed into law AB 1054, which, among other policy reforms, provides for the establishment of a statewide fund that is available for eligible electric utility companies to pay eligible claims for liabilities arising from wildfires occurring after July 12, 2019 that are caused by the applicable electric utility company&#8217;s equipment. Although PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility contributed in accordance with AB 1054, an initial contribution of approximately $4.8 billion and first annual contribution of approximately $193 million to the Wildfire Fund on the Effective Date of the Plan to allow participation of the Utility therein, the impact of AB 1054 on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility is subject to numerous uncertainties, including the Utility&#8217;s ability to demonstrate to the CPUC that wildfire-related costs paid from the Wildfire Fund are just and reasonable, subject to a disallowance cap, and that the Wildfire Fund has sufficient remaining funds. The Wildfire Fund will only be available for payment of eligible claims so long as there are sufficient funds remaining in the Wildfire Fund. Such funds could be depleted more quickly than expected, including as a result of claims made by California&#8217;s other participating electric utility companies. (See also, &#8220;PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected if the Utility does not maintain an AB1054 safety certification or is otherwise unable to access the Wildfire Fund.&#8221; above.) 
The costs of participating in the Wildfire Fund are expected to exceed $6.7 billion over the anticipated ten-year life of the fund. The timing and amount of any potential charges associated with the Utility&#8217;s contributions would also depend on various factors. In addition, there could also be a significant delay between the occurrence of a wildfire and the timing on which the Utility recognizes impairment for the reduction in future coverage, due to the lack of data available to the Utility following a catastrophic event, especially if the wildfire occurs in the service territory of another participating electric utility. Participation in the Wildfire Fund is expected to have a material impact on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows, and there can be no assurance that the benefits of participating in the Wildfire Fund ultimately outweigh these substantial costs. 
Finally, AB 1054 revised some of the SB 901 requirements regarding WMPs, including creating a WSD to review future plans and that plans should cover a three-year period. 
In June 2018, the State of California enacted the CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, with a 12-month look-back period requiring compliance by January 1, 2019. On October 11, 2019, the State of California announced proposed regulations which provide guidance on the requirements of the CCPA. The CCPA requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices, allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and provides a new cause of action for data breaches. The CCPA provides for financial penalties in the event of non-compliance and statutory damages in the event of a data security breach. On November 3, 2020, Californians voted to approve Proposition 24, a ballot measure that creates the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). The CPRA, which will become effective on January 1, 2023, amends and expands the CCPA. Failure to comply with the CCPA and the CPRA could result in fines imposed on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility that could be material. 
Also, on September 10, 2018, the California Governor signed into law SB 100 (the 100 Percent Clean Energy Act of 2018), which increased the percentage from 50% to 60% of California&#8217;s electricity portfolio that must come from renewables by 2030; and establishes state policy that 100% of all retail electricity sales must come from renewable portfolio standard-eligible or carbon-free resources by 2045. Failure to comply with SB 100 could result in fines imposed on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility that could be material and could also result in negative publicity. 
Finally, on June 30, 2020, the California Governor signed into law SB 350 (the Golden State Energy Act), a bill which authorizes the creation by the Governor of a new entity, &#8220;Golden State Energy,&#8221; a nonprofit public benefit corporation, for the purpose of acquiring the Utility&#8217;s assets and serving electric and gas in the Utility&#8217;s service territory only in the event that the CPUC determines that the Utility&#8217;s Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity should be revoked pursuant to any process or procedures adopted by the CPUC in its decision approving PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s Plan of Reorganization. 
The Utility is subject to extensive regulations and the risk of enforcement proceedings in connection with compliance with such regulations. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by the outcomes of the CPUC&#8217;s investigative enforcement proceedings against the Utility, other known enforcement matters, and other ongoing state and federal investigations and requests for information. 
The Utility is subject to extensive regulations, including federal, state and local energy, environmental and other laws and regulations, and the risk of enforcement proceedings in connection with compliance with such regulations. The Utility could incur material charges, including fines and other penalties, in connection with the order to show cause related to the 2019 PSPS events, the OII related to the 2019 PSPS events, the safety culture OII, and other matters that the CPUC&#8217;s SED may be investigating. The SED could launch investigations at any time on any issue it deems appropriate. 
The Utility could be subject to additional regulatory or governmental enforcement action in the future with respect to compliance with federal, state or local laws, regulations or orders that could result in additional fines, penalties or customer refunds, including those regarding renewable energy and resource adequacy requirements; customer billing; customer service; affiliate transactions; vegetation management; design, construction, operating and maintenance practices; safety and inspection practices; compliance with CPUC general orders or other applicable CPUC decisions or regulations; federal electric reliability standards; and environmental compliance. CPUC staff could also impose penalties on the Utility in the future in accordance with its authority under the gas and electric safety citation programs. The amount of such fines, penalties, or customer refunds could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The Utility also is a target of a number of investigations, in addition to certain investigations in connection with the wildfires. (See &#8220;Risks Related to Wildfires,&#8221; above.) The Utility is unable to predict the outcome of pending investigations, including whether any charges will be brought against the Utility, or the amount of any costs and expenses associated with such investigations. 
If these investigations result in enforcement action against the Utility, the Utility could incur additional fines or penalties the amount of which could be substantial and, in the event of a judgment against the Utility, suffer further ongoing negative consequences. Furthermore, a negative outcome in any of these investigations, or future enforcement actions, could negatively affect the outcome of future ratemaking and regulatory proceedings to which the Utility may be subject; for example, by enabling parties to challenge the Utility&#8217;s request to recover costs that the parties allege are somehow related to the Utility&#8217;s violations. (See also &#8220;PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected in the event of further non-compliance with the terms of probation or in the event of modifications to the conditions of probation&#8221; above.) 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results primarily depend on the outcomes of regulatory and ratemaking proceedings and the Utility&#8217;s ability to manage its operating expenses and capital expenditures so that it is able to earn its authorized rate of return in a timely manner. 
As a regulated entity, the Utility&#8217;s rates are set by the CPUC or the FERC on a prospective basis and are generally designed to allow the Utility to collect sufficient revenues to recover reasonable costs of providing service, including a return on its capital investments. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected if the CPUC or the FERC does not authorize sufficient revenues for the Utility to safely and reliably serve its customers and earn its authorized ROE. The outcome of the Utility&#8217;s ratemaking proceedings can be affected by many factors, including the level of opposition by intervening parties; potential rate impacts; increasing levels of regulatory review; changes in the political, regulatory, or legislative environments; and the opinions of the Utility&#8217;s regulators, consumer and other stakeholder organizations, and customers, about the Utility&#8217;s ability to provide safe, reliable, and affordable electric and gas services. Further, an increase in the amount of capacity located in the Utility&#8217;s service territory that is procured by the CAISO could increase the Utility&#8217;s costs of procuring capacity needed for reliable service to its customers. 
In addition to the amount of authorized revenues, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected if the Utility&#8217;s actual costs to safely and reliably serve its customers differ from authorized or forecast costs. The Utility may incur additional costs for many reasons including changing market circumstances, unanticipated events (such as wildfires, storms, earthquakes, accidents, or catastrophic or other events affecting the Utility&#8217;s operations), or compliance with new state laws or policies. Although the Utility may be allowed to recover some or all of the additional costs, there may be a substantial delay between when the Utility incurs the costs and when the Utility is authorized to collect revenues to recover such costs. Alternatively, the CPUC or the FERC may disallow costs that they determine were not reasonably or prudently incurred by the Utility. 
The Utility also is required to incur costs to comply with legislative and regulatory requirements and initiatives, such as those relating to the development of a state-wide electric vehicle charging infrastructure, the deployment of distributed energy resources, implementation of demand response and customer energy efficiency programs, energy storage and renewable energy targets, underground gas storage, and the construction of the California high-speed rail project. The Utility&#8217;s ability to recover costs, including its investments, associated with these and other legislative and regulatory initiatives will depend, in large part, on the final form of legislative or regulatory requirements, and the associated ratemaking mechanisms associated with these initiatives, including the timely adjustment of such mechanisms to reflect any lowered customer demand for the Utility&#8217;s electricity and natural gas services. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results depend upon the Utility&#8217;s continuing ability to recover &#8220;pass-through&#8221; costs, including electricity and natural gas procurement costs, from customers in a timely manner. The CPUC may disallow procurement costs for a variety of reasons. In addition, the Utility&#8217;s ability to recover these costs could be affected by the loss of Utility customers and decreased new customer growth, if the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility&#8217;s rates to reflect such events. 
The Utility meets customer demand for electricity from a variety of sources, including electricity generated from the Utility&#8217;s own generation facilities, electricity provided by third parties under power purchase agreements, and purchases on the wholesale electricity market. The Utility must manage these sources using the commercial and CPUC regulatory principles of &#8220;least cost dispatch&#8221; and prudent administration of power purchase agreements in compliance with its CPUC-approved long-term procurement plan. The CPUC could disallow procurement costs incurred by the Utility if the CPUC determines that the Utility did not comply with these principles or if the Utility did not comply with its procurement plan. 
Further, the contractual prices for electricity under the Utility&#8217;s current or future power purchase agreements could become uneconomic in the future for a variety of reasons, including developments in alternative energy technology, increased self-generation by customers, an increase in distributed generation, and lower customer demand due to adverse economic conditions or the loss of the Utility&#8217;s customers to other retail providers. Despite the CPUC&#8217;s current approval of the contracts, the CPUC could disallow contract costs in the future if it determines that the terms of such contracts, including price, do not meet the CPUC reasonableness standard. 
The Utility&#8217;s ability to recover the costs it incurs in the wholesale electricity market may be affected by whether the CAISO wholesale electricity market continues to function effectively. Although market mechanisms are designed to limit excessive prices, these market mechanisms could fail, or the related systems and software on which the market mechanisms rely may not perform as intended which could result in excessive market prices. The CPUC could prohibit the Utility from passing through the higher costs of electricity to customers. 
Further, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be affected by the loss of Utility customers and decreasing bundled load that occurs through municipalization of the Utility&#8217;s facilities, an increase in the number of CCAs that provide electricity to their residents, and an increase in the number of consumers who become direct access customers of alternative generation providers. (See &#8220;Competition in the Electricity Industry&#8221; in Item 1.) As the number of bundled customers (i.e., those customers who receive electricity and distribution service from the Utility) declines, the rates for remaining customers could increase as the Utility would have a smaller customer base from which to recover certain procurement costs. Although the Utility is permitted to collect non-bypassable charges for above market generation-related costs incurred on behalf of former customers, the charges may not be sufficient for the Utility to fully recover these costs. In addition, the Utility&#8217;s ability to collect non-bypassable charges has been, and may continue to be, challenged by certain customer groups. Furthermore, if the former customers return to receiving electricity supply from the Utility, the Utility could incur costs to meet their electricity needs that it may not be able to timely recover through rates or that it may not be able to recover at all. 
In addition, increasing levels of self-generation of electricity by customers (primarily solar installations) and the use of customer NEM, which allows self-generating customers to receive bill credits for surplus power at the full retail rate, puts upward rate pressure on remaining customers, who may incur significantly higher bills due to an increase in customers seeking alternative energy providers. 
A confluence of technology-related cost declines and sustained federal or state subsidies could make a combination of distributed generation and energy storage a viable, cost-effective alternative to the Utility&#8217;s bundled electric service which could further threaten the Utility&#8217;s ability to recover its generation, transmission, and distribution investments. If the number of the Utility&#8217;s customers decreases or grows at a slower rate than anticipated, the Utility&#8217;s level of authorized capital investment could decline as well, leading to a slower growth in rate base and earnings. Reduced energy demand or significantly slowed growth in demand due to customer migration to other energy providers, adoption of energy efficient technology, conservation, increasing levels of distributed generation and self-generation, unless substantially offset through regulatory cost allocations, could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
Further, changes in commodity prices also may have an adverse effect on the Utility&#8217;s ability to timely recover its operating costs and earn its authorized ROE. Although the Utility generally recovers its electricity and natural gas procurement costs from customers as &#8220;pass-through&#8221; costs, a significant and sustained rise in commodity prices could create overall rate pressures that make it more difficult for the Utility to recover its costs that are not categorized as &#8220;pass-through&#8221; costs. To relieve some of this upward rate pressure, the CPUC could authorize lower revenues than the Utility requested or disallow full cost recovery. 
If the Utility is unable to recover a material portion of its procurement costs and/or if the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility&#8217;s rates to reflect the impact of changing loads, the wide deployment of distributed generation, and the development of new electricity generation and energy storage technologies, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
Risks Related to Operations and Information Technology 
The Utility&#8217;s electricity and natural gas operations are inherently hazardous and involve significant risks which, if they materialize, can materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The Utility owns and operates extensive electricity and natural gas facilities, including two nuclear generation units and an extensive hydroelectric generating system. (See &#8220;Electric Utility Operations&#8221; and &#8220;Natural Gas Utility Operations&#8221; in Item 1. Business above.) The Utility&#8217;s ability to earn its authorized ROE depends on its ability to efficiently maintain, operate, and protect its facilities, and provide electricity and natural gas services safely and reliably. The Utility undertakes substantial capital investment projects to construct, replace, and improve its electricity and natural gas facilities. In addition, the Utility is obligated to decommission its electricity generation facilities at the end of their useful operating lives, and the CPUC approved retirement of Diablo Canyon by 2024 and 2025. 
The Utility&#8217;s ability to safely and reliably operate, maintain, construct and decommission its facilities is subject to numerous risks, many of which are beyond the Utility&#8217;s control, including those that arise from: 
The occurrence of any of these events could interrupt fuel supplies; affect demand for electricity or natural gas; cause unplanned outages or reduce generating output; damage the Utility&#8217;s assets or operations; damage the assets or operations of third parties on which the Utility relies; damage property owned by customers or others; and cause personal injury or death. As a result, the Utility could incur costs to purchase replacement power, to repair assets and restore service, and to compensate third parties. Any of such incidents also could lead to significant claims against the Utility. 
Further, although the Utility often enters into agreements for third-party contractors to perform work, such as patrolling and inspection of facilities, vegetation management, or the construction or demolition or facilities, the Utility may retain liability for the quality and completion of the contractor&#8217;s work and can be subject to penalties or other enforcement action if the contractor violates applicable laws, rules, regulations, or orders. The Utility may also be subject to liability, penalties or other enforcement action as a result of personal injury or death caused by third-party contractor actions. 
Insurance, equipment warranties, or other contractual indemnification requirements may not be sufficient or effective to provide full or even partial recovery under all circumstances or against all hazards or liabilities to which the Utility may become subject. An uninsured loss could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The Utility&#8217;s insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover losses caused by an operating failure or catastrophic events, including severe weather events and events resulting from these conditions (including wildfires), or may not be available at a reasonable cost, or available at all. 
The Utility has experienced increased costs and difficulties in obtaining insurance coverage for wildfires and other risks that could arise from the Utility&#8217;s ordinary operations. PG&#38;E Corporation, the Utility or its contractors and customers could continue to experience coverage reductions and/or increased insurance costs in future years. No assurance can be given that future losses will not exceed the limits of the Utility&#8217;s insurance coverage. Uninsured losses and increases in the cost of insurance may not be recoverable in customer rates. A loss that is not fully insured or cannot be recovered in customer rates could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
As a result of the potential application to IOUs of a strict liability standard under the doctrine of inverse condemnation, recent losses recorded by insurance companies, past wildfires and the risk of increased wildfires including as a result of climate change, the Utility may not be able to obtain sufficient insurance coverage in the future at a reasonable cost, or at all. In addition, the Utility is unable to predict whether it would be allowed to recover in rates the increased costs of insurance or the costs of any uninsured losses. Also, the Utility will not be able to obtain any recovery from the Wildfire Fund for wildfire-related losses in any year that do not exceed the greater of $1.0 billion in the aggregate and the amount of insurance coverage required under AB 1054. The Wildfire Fund would be available to the Utility to pay eligible claims for liabilities arising from future wildfires and would serve as an alternative to traditional insurance products, provided that the Utility satisfies the conditions to the Utility&#8217;s ongoing participation in the Wildfire Fund set forth in AB 1054 and that the Wildfire Fund has sufficient remaining funds. (See &#8220;Insurance Coverage&#8221; in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) 
If the amount of insurance is insufficient or otherwise unavailable, or if the Utility is unable to obtain insurance at a reasonable cost or recover in rates the costs of any uninsured losses, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
The electric power and gas industries are undergoing significant changes driven by technological advancements and a decarbonized economy, which could materially affect the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The electric power industry is undergoing transformative change driven by technological advancements enabling customer choice (for example, customer-owned generation and energy storage) and state climate policy supporting a decarbonized economy. The electric grid is a critical enabler of the adoption of new energy technologies that support California&#8217;s climate change and GHG reduction objectives, which continue to be publicly supported by California policymakers. California's environmental policy objectives are accelerating the pace and scope of the industry change. For instance, SB 100, which was signed into law on September 10, 2018, increases from 50% to 60%, the percentage of California&#8217;s electricity portfolio that must come from renewables by 2030. SB 100 establishes a further goal to have an electric grid that is entirely powered by clean energy by 2045. California utilities also are experiencing increasing deployment by customers and third parties of DERs, such as on-site solar generation, energy storage, fuel cells, energy efficiency, and demand response technologies. These developments will require modernization of the electric distribution grid to, among other things, accommodate two-way flows of electricity, increase the grid&#8217;s capacity, and interconnect DERs. 
In order to enable the California clean energy economy, sustained investments are required in grid modernization, renewable integration projects, energy efficiency programs, energy storage options, EV infrastructure and state infrastructure modernization (e.g., rail and water projects). 
To this end, the CPUC is conducting proceedings to: evaluate changes to the planning and operation of the electric distribution grid in order to prepare for higher penetration of DERs and, consider future grid modernization and grid reinforcement investments; evaluate if traditional grid investments can be deferred by DERs, and if feasible, what, if any, compensation to utilities would be appropriate for enabling those investments; and clarify the role of the electric distribution grid operator. The CPUC also authorized development of two new, five-year programs aimed at accelerating widespread electric vehicle adoption and combating climate change. The new programs will increase fast charging options for consumers as well as electric charging infrastructure for non-light-duty fleet vehicles. 
In addition, in light of the state&#8217;s commitment to clean energy and carbon neutral economy by 2045, California has recently proposed public policies that prohibit or restrict the use and consumption of natural gas, for example in buildings, that will have for effect to reduce the use of natural gas. Reducing natural gas use could lead to a reduction in the gas customer base and a diminished need for gas infrastructure and, as a result, could lead to certain gas assets no longer be &#8220;used and useful,&#8221; potentially causing substantial investment value of gas assets to be stranded. (Under CPUC precedent, when an asset no longer meets the standard of &#8220;used and useful,&#8221; the asset is removed from rate base, which may result in a reduction in associated rate recovery.) However, while natural gas demand is projected to decline over time, the costs of operating a safe and reliable gas delivery system in California have been increasing, among other things, to cover the cost of long-term pipeline safety enhancements. Inability by the Utility to recover in rates its investments into the natural gas system while still ensuring gas system safety and reliability could materially affect the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The industry changes, costs associated with complying with new regulatory developments and initiatives and with technological advancements, or the Utility&#8217;s inability to successfully adapt to changes in the electric and gas industry, could materially affect the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
A cyber incident, cyber security breach, severe natural event or physical attack on the Utility&#8217;s operational networks and information technology systems could have a material effect on its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The Utility&#8217;s electricity and natural gas systems rely on a complex, interconnected network of generation, transmission, distribution, control, and communication technologies, which can be damaged by natural events-such as severe weather or seismic events-and by malicious events, such as cyber and physical attacks. Private and public entities, such as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and the U.S. Federal government, including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Energy, and the White House, have noted that cyber-attacks targeting utility systems are increasing in sophistication, magnitude, and frequency. The Utility&#8217;s operational networks also may face new cyber security risks due to modernizing and interconnecting the existing infrastructure with new technologies and control systems. Any failure or decrease in the functionality of the Utility&#8217;s operational networks could cause harm to the public or employees, significantly disrupt operations, negatively impact the Utility&#8217;s ability to safely generate, transport, deliver and store energy and gas or otherwise operate in the most safe and efficient manner or at all, and damage the Utility&#8217;s assets or operations or those of third parties. 
The Utility also relies on complex information technology systems that allow it to create, collect, use, disclose, store and otherwise process sensitive information, including the Utility&#8217;s financial information, customer energy usage and billing information, and personal information regarding customers, employees and their dependents, contractors, and other individuals. In addition, the Utility often relies on third-party vendors to host, maintain, modify, and update its systems, and to provide other services to the Utility or the Utility&#8217;s customers. In addition, the Utility is increasingly being required to disclose large amounts of data (including customer energy usage and personal information regarding customers) to support changes to California&#8217;s electricity market related to grid modernization and customer choice. These third-party vendors could cease to exist, fail to establish adequate processes to protect the Utility&#8217;s systems and information, or experience security incidents or inadequate security measures. Any incidents or disruptions in the Utility&#8217;s information technology systems could impact the Utility&#8217;s ability to track or collect revenues and to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting. 
The Utility and its third-party vendors have been subject to, and will likely continue to be subject to, breaches and attempts to gain unauthorized access to the Utility&#8217;s information technology systems or confidential data (including information about customers and employees), or to disrupt the Utility&#8217;s operations. None of these breaches or attempts has individually or in the aggregate resulted in a security incident with a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. Despite implementation of security and control measures, there can be no assurance that the Utility will be able to prevent unauthorized access to its operational networks, information technology systems or data, or the disruption of its operations. Such events could subject the Utility to significant expenses, claims by customers or third parties, government inquiries, penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, investigations, and regulatory actions that could result in material fines and penalties, loss of customers and harm to PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s reputation, any of which could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The Utility maintains cyber liability insurance that covers certain damages caused by cyber incidents. However, there is no guarantee that adequate insurance will continue to be available at rates the Utility believes are reasonable or that the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident will be covered by insurance or recoverable in rates. 
The operation and decommissioning of the Utility&#8217;s nuclear generation facilities expose it to potentially significant liabilities and the Utility may not be able to fully recover its costs if regulatory requirements or operating conditions change or the facilities cease operations before the licenses expire. 
The operation of the Utility&#8217;s nuclear generation facilities exposes it to potentially significant liabilities from environmental, health and financial risks, such as risks relating to operation of the Diablo Canyon nuclear generation units as well as the storage, handling and disposal of spent nuclear fuel, and the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity, natural disaster, or terrorist act. If the Utility incurs losses that are either not covered by insurance or exceed the amount of insurance available, such losses could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. In addition, the Utility may be required under federal law to pay up to $275 million of liabilities arising out of each nuclear incident occurring not only at the Utility&#8217;s Diablo Canyon facility but at any other nuclear power plant in the United States. 
On January 11, 2018, the CPUC approved the retirement of Diablo Canyon units by 2024 and 2025. However, the Utility continues to face public concern about the safety of nuclear generation and nuclear fuel. Some of these nuclear opposition groups regularly file petitions at the NRC and in other forums challenging the actions of the NRC and urging governmental entities to adopt laws or policies in opposition to nuclear power. Although an action in opposition may ultimately fail, regulatory proceedings may take longer to conclude and be more costly to complete. It is also possible that public pressure could grow leading to adverse changes in legislation, regulations, orders, or their interpretation. As a result, operations at the Utility&#8217;s two nuclear generation units at Diablo Canyon could cease before their respective licenses expire in 2024 and 2025. In such an instance, the Utility could be required to record a charge for the remaining amount of its unrecovered investment and such charge could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
In addition, in order to retain highly skilled personnel necessary to safely operate Diablo Canyon during the remaining years of operations, the Utility will incur costs in connection with (i) an employee retention program to ensure adequate staffing levels at Diablo Canyon, which program has been approved by the CPUC, and (ii) an employee retraining and development program, to facilitate redeployment of a portion of Diablo Canyon personnel to the decommissioning project and elsewhere in the Utility. There can be no assurance that the Utility will be successful in retaining highly skilled personnel under its employee programs. 
The Utility has incurred, and may continue to incur, substantial costs to comply with NRC regulations and orders. (See &#8220;Regulatory Environment&#8221; in Item 1. Business above.) If the Utility were unable to recover these costs, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected. The Utility may determine that it cannot comply with the new regulations or orders in a feasible and economic manner and voluntarily cease operations; alternatively, the NRC may order the Utility to cease operations until the Utility can comply with new regulations, orders, or decisions. The Utility may incur a material charge if it ceases operations at Diablo Canyon&#8217;s two nuclear generation units before their respective licenses expire in 2024 and 2025. At December 31, 2020, the Utility&#8217;s unrecovered investment in Diablo Canyon was $1.4 billion. 
The Utility also has an obligation to decommission its electricity generation facilities, including its nuclear facilities, as well as gas transmission system assets, at the end of their useful lives. (See Note 3: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - &#8220;Asset Retirement Obligations&#8221; of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement in Item 8.) The CPUC authorizes the Utility to recover its estimated costs to decommission its nuclear facilities through nuclear decommissioning charges that are collected from customers and held in nuclear decommissioning trusts to be used for the eventual decommissioning of each nuclear unit. If the Utility&#8217;s actual decommissioning costs, including the amounts held in the nuclear decommissioning trusts, exceed estimated costs, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
Diablo Canyon Unit 2 has experienced four outages between July 2020 and February 24, 2021, each due or related to malfunctions within the main generator associated with excessive vibrations. If the Utility is unable to adequately address the vibration issues in the Unit 2 generator, it may be required to operate Unit 2 at reduced operating levels or take the unit out of service for additional inspection, maintenance, or replacement of the affected component. Actions that may be necessary in response to the vibrations affecting the generator, or the occurrence or length of future outages, may result in incremental costs or forgone power market revenues. The Utility will also be subject to a review of the reasonableness of its actions before the CPUC. If additional outages occur in the future, or if Unit 2&#8217;s planned spring 2021 refueling outage is extended due to the inspections and replacement of the affected component, the Utility may incur additional incremental costs or forgo additional power market revenues. Furthermore, the cost of such actions may exceed current estimates, such costs may not be fully recovered from insurance through NEIL, or the costs may not be recovered through regulatory processes or otherwise. These amounts could be material and have a material effect on the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. 
Risks Related to Environmental Factors 
Severe weather conditions, extended drought and shifting climate patterns could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
Extreme weather, drought and shifting climate patterns have intensified the challenges associated with wildfire management in California. The Utility&#8217;s service territory encompasses some of the most densely forested areas in California and, as a consequence, is subject to higher risk from vegetation-related ignition events than other California IOUs. Further, environmental extremes, such as drought conditions followed by periods of wet weather, can drive additional vegetation growth (which can then fuel fires) and influence both the likelihood and severity of extraordinary wildfire events. In particular, the risk posed by wildfires has increased in the Utility&#8217;s service area as a result of a prior extended period of drought, bark beetle infestations in the California forest and wildfire fuel increases due to rising temperatures and record rainfall following the drought, and strong wind events, among other environmental factors. Contributing factors other than environmental can include local land use policies and historical forestry management practices. The combined effects of extreme weather and climate change also impact this risk. According to CalFire, as of December 12, 2020, over 9,639 fires have burned 4,359,517 acres, more than four percent of the state&#8217;s roughly 100 million acres of land, making 2020 the largest wildfire season recorded in California&#8217;s modern history. In January 2018, the CPUC approved a statewide fire-threat map that shows that approximately half of the Utility&#8217;s service territory is facing &#8220;elevated&#8221; or &#8220;extreme&#8221; fire danger. Approximately 25,000 circuit miles of the Utility&#8217;s nearly 81,000 distribution overhead circuit miles and approximately 5,500 miles of the nearly 18,000 transmission overhead circuit miles are in such high-fire threat areas, significantly more in total than other California IOUs. 
Severe weather events and other natural disasters, including wildfires and other fires, storms, tornadoes, floods, heat waves, drought, earthquakes, tsunamis, rising sea levels, pandemics, solar events, electromagnetic events, or other natural disasters such as wildfires, could result in severe business disruptions, prolonged power outages, property damage, injuries or loss of life, significant decreases in revenues and earnings, and/or significant additional costs to PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility. Any such event could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. Any of such events also could lead to significant claims against the Utility. Further, these events could result in regulatory penalties and disallowances, particularly if the Utility encounters difficulties in restoring power to its customers on a timely basis or if the related losses are found to be the result of the Utility&#8217;s practices and/or the failure of electric and other equipment of the Utility. 
Further, the Utility has been studying the potential effects of climate change (increased temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, rising sea levels) on its assets, operations, and services, as part of its CVA. Following completion of this assessment, the Utility is developing adaptation plans to set forth a strategy for those events and conditions that the Utility believes are most significant. Scientists project that climate change will increase electricity demand due to more extreme, persistent and hot weather. As a result, the Utility&#8217;s hydroelectric generation could change, and the Utility would need to consider managing or acquiring additional generation. If the Utility increases its reliance on conventional generation resources to replace hydroelectric generation and to meet increased customer demand, it may become more costly for the Utility to comply with GHG emissions limits. In addition, climate hazards such as heatwaves, wind storms, and flooding caused by rising sea levels and extreme storms could damage the Utility&#8217;s facilities, including gas, generation, and electric transmission and distribution assets. The Utility could incur substantial costs to repair or replace facilities, restore service, or compensate customers and other third parties for damages or injuries. The Utility anticipates that the increased costs would be recovered through rates, but as rate pressures increase, the likelihood of disallowance or non-recovery may increase. 
Events or conditions caused by climate change could have a greater impact on the Utility&#8217;s operations than the Utility&#8217;s studies suggest and could result in lower revenues or increased expenses, or both. If the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility&#8217;s rates to reflect the impact of events or conditions caused by climate change, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
The Utility&#8217;s operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and changes in or liabilities under these laws could adversely affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results. 
The Utility&#8217;s operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws, regulations, and orders, relating to air quality, water quality and usage, remediation of hazardous wastes, and the protection and conservation of natural resources and wildlife. The Utility incurs significant capital, operating, and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental statutes, rules, and regulations. The Utility has been in the past, and may be in the future, required to pay for environmental remediation costs at sites where it is identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws. Although the Utility has recorded liabilities for known environmental obligations, these costs can be difficult to estimate due to uncertainties about the extent of contamination, remediation alternatives, the applicable remediation levels, and the financial ability of other potentially responsible parties. (For more information, see Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) 
Environmental remediation costs could increase in the future as a result of new legislation, the current trend toward more stringent standards, and stricter and more expansive application of existing environmental regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or failure to comply with the terms of licenses or permits issued by environmental or regulatory agencies, could expose the Utility to claims by third parties or the imposition of civil or criminal fines or other sanctions. 
The CPUC has authorized the Utility to recover its environmental remediation costs for certain sites through various ratemaking mechanisms. One of these mechanisms allows the Utility rate recovery for 90% of its hazardous substance remediation costs for certain approved sites without a reasonableness review. The CPUC may discontinue or change these ratemaking mechanisms in the future or the Utility may incur environmental costs that exceed amounts the CPUC has authorized the Utility to recover in rates. 
Some of the Utility&#8217;s environmental costs, such as the remediation costs associated with the Hinkley natural gas compressor site, are not recoverable through rates or insurance. (See &#8220;Environmental Regulation&#8221; in Item 1. and Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) The Utility&#8217;s costs to remediate groundwater contamination near the Hinkley natural gas compressor site and to abate the effects of the contamination have had, and may continue to have, a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results. Their financial results also can be materially affected by changes in estimated costs and by the extent to which actual remediation costs differ from recorded liabilities. 
State climate policy requires reductions in greenhouse gas emissions of 40% by 2030 and 80% by 2050. Various proposals for addressing these reductions have the potential to reduce natural gas usage and increase natural gas costs, which may impact the future of natural gas services. The future recovery of the increased costs associated with compliance is uncertain. 
The CARB is the state&#8217;s primary regulator for GHG emission reduction programs. Natural gas providers have been subject to compliance with CARB&#8217;s Cap-and-Trade Program since 2015, and natural gas end-use customers have an increasing exposure to carbon costs under the Program through 2030 when the full cost will be reflected in customer bills. CARB&#8217;s Scoping Plan also proposes various methods of reducing GHG emissions from natural gas. These include more aggressive energy efficiency programs to reduce natural gas end use, increased renewable portfolio standards generation in the electric sector reducing noncore gas load, and replacement of natural gas appliances with electric appliances, leading to further reduced demand. These natural gas load reductions may be partially offset by CARB&#8217;s proposals to deploy natural gas to replace wood fuel in home heating and diesel in transportation applications. CARB also proposes a displacement of some conventional natural gas with above-market renewable natural gas. The combination of reduced load and increased costs could result in higher natural gas customer bills and a potential mandate to deliver renewable natural gas could lead to cost recovery risk. In addition, local city governments have passed ordinances restricting use of natural gas in new construction, and if other jurisdictions follow suit, this could affect future demand for the provision of natural gas. 
General Risk Factors 
The Utility&#8217;s success depends on the availability of the services of a qualified workforce and its ability to maintain satisfactory collective bargaining agreements which cover a substantial number of employees. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s results may suffer if the Utility is unable to attract and retain qualified personnel and senior management talent, or if prolonged labor disruptions occur. 
The Utility&#8217;s workforce is aging, and many employees are or will become eligible to retire within the next few years. Although the Utility has undertaken efforts to recruit and train new field service personnel, the Utility may be faced with a shortage of experienced and qualified personnel. The majority of the Utility&#8217;s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with three unions. Labor disruptions could occur depending on the outcome of negotiations to renew the terms of these agreements with the unions or if tentative new agreements are not ratified by their members. In addition, some of the remaining non-represented Utility employees could join one of these unions in the future. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility also may face challenges in attracting and retaining senior management talent especially if they are unable to restore the reputational harm generated by the negative publicity stemming from the ongoing enforcement proceedings and the recent Chapter 11 Cases. Any such occurrences could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.

PCG,PG&E Corp,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1004980/000100498020000009/0001004980-20-000009.txt,2020-02-18T08:46:35-05:00," ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results can be affected by many factors, including estimates and assumptions used in the critical accounting policies described in MD&#38;A, that can cause their actual financial results to differ materially from historical results or from anticipated future financial results. The following discussion of key risk factors should be considered in evaluating an investment in PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility and should be read in conjunction with MD&#38;A and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this 2019 Form 10-K. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
Risks Related to Chapter 11 Proceedings and Liquidity 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 and are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with their bankruptcy cases. 
On the Petition Date, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 in the Bankruptcy Court. For the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases, the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility will be subject to various risks, including but not limited to the following: 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility currently are and will continue to be subject to risks and uncertainties with respect to the actions and decisions of creditors and other third parties who have claims or interests in the Chapter 11 Cases that may be inconsistent with PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s plans. These risks and uncertainties could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows in various ways that cannot be predicted and may significantly increase the time PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have to operate in Chapter 11. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 Cases, it is not possible to predict or quantify the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 Cases may have on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows, nor is it possible to predict the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 Cases may have on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s corporate and capital structure. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility currently are and will continue to be required to seek approvals of the Bankruptcy Court and certain regulators in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, and certain parties may object, intervene and protest approval, absent the imposition of terms or conditions to resolve their concerns. Such approvals may be denied, conditioned or delayed. 
Operating under Chapter 11 may continue to restrict the ability of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility to pursue strategic and operational initiatives. 
Under Chapter 11, transactions outside the ordinary course of business are subject to the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court, which may limit PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to respond in a timely manner to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities or to adapt to changing market or industry conditions. These limitations include, among other things, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to: 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility may continue to experience increased levels of employee attrition as a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases. 
As a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have experienced and may continue to experience increased levels of employee attrition, and their employees will continue to face considerable distraction and uncertainty. A loss of key personnel or material erosion of employee morale could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to engage, motivate and retain key employees or take other measures intended to motivate and incentivize key employees to remain with PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility, as applicable, through the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is limited by restrictions on implementation of retention and incentive programs under the Bankruptcy Code. The loss of members of senior management could impair PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to execute their strategies and implement operational initiatives, which would likely have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
As a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s historical financial information may not be indicative of future financial performance. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s capital structure will likely be significantly altered under any plan of reorganization confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court. Under fresh-start accounting rules that may apply to PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility upon the effective date of a plan of reorganization, their assets and liabilities would be adjusted to fair value. Accordingly, if fresh-start accounting rules apply, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations following emergence from Chapter 11 would not be comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in their historical financial statements. In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases and the development of a plan of reorganization, it is also possible that additional restructuring and related charges may be identified and recorded in future periods. Such charges could be material to PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
If PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are not able to consummate a consensual plan of reorganization, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by a protracted restructuring. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility commenced the Chapter 11 Cases without the benefit of a restructuring support agreement or agreed consensual plan of reorganization with any of its creditors or other key constituents. On October 17, 2019, the TCC and the Ad Hoc Noteholder Committee filed their competing Ad Hoc Noteholder Plan. In connection with the Noteholder RSA (as defined below), the competing Ad Hoc Noteholder Plan was withdrawn on February 5, 2020. If the Noteholder RSA were to be terminated, or if a new competing plan of reorganization were filed by any constituents, the resulting competing plan process could reduce the likelihood that the plan of reorganization that is ultimately confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court is the Proposed Plan and, in any event, could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to achieve confirmation of a plan of reorganization that would enable PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility to reach their stated goals. Additionally, any RSAs entered into in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases are likely to be highly conditional on circumstances outside the control of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility. 
Accordingly, no assurance can be provided as to the length of time during which the Chapter 11 Cases will be pending, whether the Proposed Plan can be successfully consummated, how the terms of the Proposed Plan may change, whether the Proposed Plan will be the plan of reorganization that is ultimately consummated, how the proposed post-emergence capital structure may change, and what the effect of the Proposed Plan or any other plan of reorganization that is confirmed would have on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility or on any of their respective equity, debt and other stakeholders, including as to matters of taxation and recovery or distributions upon consummation of any plan of reorganization. 
Even if PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are successful in obtaining confirmation of the Proposed Plan, the process has been, and will continue to be lengthy, costly and disruptive. A contested plan of reorganization proceeding would likely have a more pronounced material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows than a consensual plan of reorganization. Even if PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are able to obtain requisite stakeholder approval, the Bankruptcy Court may not confirm a plan of reorganization. 
The uncertainty surrounding the prolonged restructuring may also have other material effects on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility including, but not limited to: 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility may be subject to claims that will not be discharged in their Chapter 11 Cases, which could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The Bankruptcy Code provides that the confirmation of a plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from substantially all claims arising prior to its filing under Chapter 11. With few exceptions, all claims that arose prior to PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s Chapter 11 Cases: (i) would be subject to compromise and/or treatment under the plan of reorganization and (ii) would be discharged in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and the terms of the plan of reorganization. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility face several significant potential liabilities that arose after the start of the Chapter 11 Cases, including potential liabilities associated with the 2019 Kincade fire and the PSPS Program. Any claims not ultimately discharged through a plan of reorganization could be asserted against the reorganized entities and may have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows on a post-reorganization basis and may cast substantial doubt on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. 
The DIP Facilities may be insufficient to fund PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s cash requirements through their emergence from bankruptcy. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s liquidity, including PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to meet their ongoing operational obligations, is dependent upon, among other things: (i) PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to comply with the terms and conditions of any post-petition financing and cash collateral order entered by the Bankruptcy Court in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, including the financing orders entered with respect to the DIP Credit Agreement, (ii) PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to maintain adequate cash on hand, (iii) PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to generate cash flow from operations, (iv) PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to develop, confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization or other alternative restructuring transaction and (v) the cost, duration and outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases. For the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility will be subject to various risks, including but not limited to (i) the inability to maintain or obtain sufficient financing sources for operations or to fund any plan of reorganization and meet future obligations, and (ii) increased legal and other professional costs associated with the Chapter 11 Cases and the reorganization. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have entered into the DIP Credit Agreement. On March 27, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court approved the DIP Facilities (as defined below) on a final basis, authorizing the Utility to borrow up to the full amount of the DIP Revolving Facility (including the full amount of the $1.5 billion letter of credit subfacility), the DIP Initial Term Loan Facility and the DIP Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility (as defined below), in each case subject to the terms and conditions of the DIP Credit Agreement. For the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility expect that the DIP Credit Agreement, together with cash on hand and cash flow from operations, will be the Utility&#8217;s primary source of capital to fund ongoing operations and other capital needs and that they will have limited, if any, access to additional financing. For more information on the DIP Credit Agreement, see Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 
The DIP Credit Agreement will mature on December 31, 2020, subject to the Utility&#8217;s option to extend the maturity to December 31, 2021 if certain terms and conditions are satisfied, including the payment of an extension fee. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have faced and will continue to face uncertainty regarding the adequacy of their liquidity and capital resources during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, and have limited, if any, access to additional financing. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility cannot provide assurance that cash on hand, cash flow from operations, distributions received from their subsidiaries and borrowings available under the DIP Credit Agreement will be sufficient to continue to fund operations during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases. Although the DIP Credit Agreement is expected to be sufficient to address liquidity needs for the expected duration of the Chapter 11 Cases, if the Chapter 11 Cases last longer than expected (particularly if the Proposed Plan is not confirmed by June 30, 2020) there can be no assurance that the DIP Credit Agreement will provide adequate liquidity for such scenario. The ability of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility to maintain adequate liquidity depends in part upon industry conditions and general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond their control. In the event that cash on hand, cash flow from operations, distributions received from subsidiaries and availability under the DIP Credit Agreement are not sufficient to meet these liquidity needs, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility may be required to seek additional financing, and can provide no assurance that additional financing would be available or, if available, offered on acceptable terms. 
The DIP Credit Agreement imposes a number of restrictions on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility that may, among other things, limit their ability to conduct their business, or pursue new business opportunities and strategies. Additionally, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility may be unable to comply with the covenants imposed by the DIP Credit Agreement. Such non-compliance could result in an event of default under the DIP Credit Agreement that, if not cured or waived, could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The DIP Credit Agreement imposes a number of restrictions on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility, including, among other things, affirmative covenants requiring PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility to provide financial information, cash flow forecasts, variance reports and other information to the administrative agent. The DIP Credit Agreement also contains general affirmative covenants such as compliance with all applicable laws, maintenance of licenses from necessary governmental authorities, maintenance of property and preservation of corporate existence. Negative covenants contained in the DIP Credit Agreement include restrictions on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, create liens on assets, make investments, loans or advances, engage in mergers, consolidations, sales of assets and acquisitions, pay dividends and distributions, and make payments in respect of junior or pre-petition indebtedness, in each case subject to customary exceptions. The Utility&#8217;s ability to borrow under the DIP Credit Agreement is subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions precedent set forth therein. For more information on the DIP Credit Agreement, see Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 
As a result of these covenants and restrictions, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility may be limited in their ability to conduct their business, and respond to changing business, market, and economic conditions. These provisions may also limit PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to pursue new business opportunities and strategies. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond their control and their failure to comply, or obtain a waiver in the event PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility cannot comply with a covenant, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing the DIP Credit Agreement that, if not cured or waived, could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The Backstop Commitment Letters and the Debt Commitment Letters provide a number of conditions precedent to the obligations of the Backstop Parties and the Commitment Parties to fund the Proposed Plan as well as a number of termination rights for the Backstop Parties and the Commitment Parties. There can be no assurance that the conditions precedent will be satisfied or waived, or that events or circumstances will not occur that give rise to the termination rights. If the conditions precedent to funding cannot be satisfied or waived, or if the Backstop Commitment Letters or the Debt Commitment Letters are terminated, it could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The Backstop Commitment Letters impose a number of conditions that must be satisfied before the Backstop Parties are obligated to fund the Proposed Plan. In addition, the Backstop Parties have certain termination rights under the Backstop Commitment Letters, which may be triggered by events beyond the control of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility. The Debt Commitment Letters are also subject to numerous conditions precedent and termination rights, including certain conditions precedent and termination rights similar to those included in the Backstop Commitment Letters, as well as certain other conditions precedent, including that the Utility shall have received investment grade senior secured debt ratings. For more information on the Backstop Commitment Letters and the Debt Commitment Letters, including a summary of conditions precedent and termination rights, see &#8220;Plan of Reorganization, RSAs, Equity Backstop Commitments and Debt Commitment Letters&#8221; in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
If PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility fail to complete a monetization transaction utilizing any net operating losses or tax deductions resulting from the payment of pre-petition wildfire-related claims as contemplated in the Backstop Commitment Letters, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility must form a trust which would provide for periodic distributions of cash to the Backstop Parties in amounts equal to (i) all tax benefits arising from the payment of wildfire-related claims in excess of (ii) the first $1.35 billion of tax benefits, starting with fiscal year 2020, and PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
There can be no assurance that the conditions precedent set forth in the Backstop Commitment Letters or the Debt Commitment Letters will be satisfied or waived, or that events or circumstances will not occur that give rise to termination rights of the Backstop Parties or the Commitment Parties, which may be beyond the control of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility. 
If the conditions precedent to funding under the Backstop Commitment Letters or the Debt Commitment Letters cannot be satisfied or waived, or if the Backstop Commitment Letters or Debt Commitment Letters are terminated, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to finance the Proposed Plan could be jeopardized, which could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. Additionally, there can be no assurance that PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility would be able to obtain alternative financing to the transactions contemplated by the Backstop Commitment Letters and the Debt Commitment Letters. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared assuming that PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility will continue as going concerns. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are facing extraordinary challenges relating to a series of catastrophic wildfires that occurred during the past several years. Uncertainty regarding these matters raises substantial doubt about PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s abilities to continue as going concerns. In addition, there is inherent uncertainty regarding the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have not included any financial statement adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements to this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared assuming that PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility will continue as going concerns. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility suffered material losses as a result of the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2018 Camp fire, which contributed to the decision to file for Chapter 11 protection. Management has concluded that these circumstances raise substantial doubt about PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to continue as going concerns, and their independent registered public accountants have included an explanatory paragraph in their auditors&#8217; report which states certain conditions exist that raise substantial doubt about PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to continue as going concerns in relation to the foregoing. In addition, there is inherent uncertainty regarding the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases. For further discussion of such uncertainty, see the risk factors above in &#8220;Risks Related to Chapter 11 Proceedings and Liquidity&#8221; in this Item 1A. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s plans in regard to these matters are described in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. See &#8220;Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm&#8221; in Item 8. 
Trading in PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s securities during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. 
Trading in PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s securities during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. The ultimate recovery, if any, by holders of PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s or the Utility&#8217;s securities in the Chapter 11 Cases could differ substantially from any value that may be implied by the trading prices of such securities at any particular time during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases. 
Risks Related to Wildfires 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by potential losses resulting from the impact of the 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 Northern California wildfires and other pre-petition fires (including the 2015 Butte fire), notwithstanding the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by potential losses resulting from the impact of the 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 Northern California wildfires and other pre-petition fires (including the 2015 Butte fire), notwithstanding the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases. As disclosed below in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are subject to numerous lawsuits in connection with the 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 Northern California wildfires and other pre-petition fires by various plaintiffs, including wildfire victims, insurance carriers, and various government entities, under multiple theories of liability. These lawsuits generally assert that the Utility&#8217;s alleged failure to maintain and repair its distribution and transmission lines and failure to properly maintain the vegetation surrounding such lines were the causes of the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires. 
Due to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, these plaintiffs have been stayed from continuing to prosecute pending litigation and from commencing new lawsuits against PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility on account of pre-petition obligations. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s obligations with respect to such claims are expected to be determined through the Chapter 11 process. If the Subrogation RSA, TCC RSA or PSAs were to be terminated and litigation relating to the 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 Northern California wildfires and other pre-petition wildfires were to recommence, and the Utility&#8217;s facilities, such as its electric distribution and transmission lines, were determined to be the substantial cause of one or more fires, and the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies, the Utility could be liable for property damage, business interruption, interest, and attorneys&#8217; fees without having been found negligent, which liability, in the aggregate, could be substantial and have a material adverse effect on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility, including on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to develop and consummate a successful plan of reorganization. (See &#8220;The doctrine of inverse condemnation, if applied by courts in litigation to which PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility are subject, could significantly expand the potential liabilities from such litigation and materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows&#8221; below.) In addition to such claims for property damage, business interruption, interest, and attorneys&#8217; fees, the Utility could be liable for fire suppression costs, evacuation costs, medical expenses, personal injury damages, punitive damages, and other damages under other theories of liability, including if the Utility were found to have been negligent, which liability, in the aggregate, could be substantial and have a material adverse effect on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility, including on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to develop and consummate a successful plan of reorganization. 
Although PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have entered into settlement agreements to resolve the claims of the major classes of claimholders, including Utility debtholders, individual wildfire victims, holders of subrogated insurance claims and certain public entities, non-consenting claimholders may still be able to challenge and otherwise impede the Proposed Plan. These settlement agreements could be terminated under various circumstances, some of which are beyond the PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s control. As described below in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have entered into agreements with major claimholders or their representatives to settle all pre-petition liabilities related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires (and in certain cases, other pre-petition fires) for an aggregate amount of $25.5 billion. These agreements are subject to numerous conditions and termination rights in favor of third parties, including, among others, (i) certain breaches by PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility, (ii) if PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility become insolvent, (iii) if the Proposed Plan is inconsistent with the terms of these agreements, (iv) if certain milestones are not met and (v) failure of the Proposed Plan or the treatment of claims contemplated thereby to be consistent with AB 1054. Certain of these agreements contain additional termination rights that are beyond the control of PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility. For example, the PSA with Supporting Public Entities may be terminated by the Supporting Public Entities if FEMA or the OES fail to agree that no reimbursement is required from the Supporting Public Entities on account of assistance rendered by either agency in connection with the wildfires noted above. If one or more of these settlement agreements is terminated, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s aggregate liability related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires (and in certain cases, other pre-petition fires) could substantially exceed $25.5 billion. In addition, if these agreements were terminated, regardless of the ultimate determination of PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s liability, such termination would be expected to result in additional delay and expense in the Chapter 11 Cases. 
In addition, the TCC RSA is an agreement among PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility, the TCC, the Shareholder Proponents, and the Consenting Fire Claimant Professionals. No government entity (including FEMA and OES/Cal Fire) is party to the TCC RSA. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that such government entities will support the Proposed Plan or the treatment of their Fire Victim Claims in the Chapter 11 Cases as provided in the Proposed Plan. If FEMA, OES/Cal Fire, or other government entities that are not Supporting Public Entities do not support the Proposed Plan or treatment of their Fire Victim Claims, such claims could be material to PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. On February 12, 2020, a number of individuals and businesses who hold wildfire-related claims in connection with the 2015 Butte fire, 2017 Northern California wildfires and 2018 Camp fire, as well as certain of the Tubbs Preference Plaintiffs, joined in the TCC&#8217;s objection to the OES and FEMA claims. Also on February 12, 2020, OES and FEMA filed oppositions to the TCC&#8217;s objection. 
Absent the settlement agreements noted above, potential liabilities related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires depend on various factors, including, but not limited to, the cause of each fire, contributing causes of the fires (including alternative potential origins, weather and climate related issues), the number, size and type of structures damaged or destroyed, the contents of such structures and other personal property damage, the number and types of trees damaged or destroyed, attorneys&#8217; fees for claimants, the nature and extent of any personal injuries, including the loss of lives, the extent to which future claims arise, the amount of fire suppression and clean-up costs and other damages the Utility may be responsible for if found negligent. Notwithstanding the Bar Date and the settlement agreements entered into as of the date of this filing, there remain a number of unknown facts and legal considerations that may impact the amount of any potential liability, including the total scope and nature of claims that may be asserted against PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility and the treatment of such claims in the Chapter 11 Cases. 
If PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility were to be found liable for any punitive damages, and such damages were allowed by the Bankruptcy Court, or if PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility were subject to fines or penalties that may be imposed by government entities on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility, the amount of such punitive damages, fines, penalties or restitution orders that may result from any criminal charges brought could be significant and could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows, as well as PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to develop and consummate a successful plan of reorganization. In connection with the Wildfires OII, the Utility has agreed to remedies that will result in substantial capital expenditures that will not be subject to cost recovery. The Utility has received significant fines and penalties in connection with past incidents. For example, in 2015, the CPUC approved a decision that imposed penalties on the Utility totaling $1.6 billion in connection with natural gas explosion that occurred in the City of San Bruno on September 9, 2010 (the &#8220;San Bruno explosion&#8221;). These penalties represented nearly three times the underlying liability for the San Bruno explosion of approximately $558 million incurred for third-party claims, exclusive of shareholder derivative lawsuits and legal costs incurred. The amount of punitive damages, fines and penalties imposed on PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility could likewise be a significant amount in relation to the underlying liabilities with respect to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires. 
In addition, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility could be the subject of additional lawsuits on account of obligations arising after the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases and of additional investigations, citations, fines or enforcement actions in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected as a result of the 2019 Kincade fire and any future post-petition wildfire during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected as a result of the 2019 Kincade fire and future post-petition wildfires during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases. 
As described below in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the heading &#8220;2019 Kincade fire,&#8221; while the cause of the 2019 Kincade fire remains under Cal Fire&#8217;s investigation and there are a number of unknown facts surrounding the cause of the 2019 Kincade fire, the Utility could be subject to significant liability in excess of insurance coverage that would be expected to have a material impact on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have received and are responding to data requests from the CPUC&#8217;s SED relating to the Kincade fire. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility could be the subject of additional investigations, lawsuits, or enforcement actions in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire. 
Additionally, regardless of whether the Utility is ultimately determined to have caused the 2019 Kincade fire or any future post-petition wildfire during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s bankruptcy timing and process and the ability of the Utility to participate in the Wildfire Fund could be materially affected as a result of claims arising out of the 2019 Kincade fire. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to consummate the Proposed Plan by June 30, 2020 (or at all) could be impaired, and PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility may not be able to amend the Proposed Plan, or develop another alternative to the Proposed Plan, that could be confirmed by June 30, 2020 or at all. The Backstop Commitment Letters and the Debt Commitment Letters contain certain conditions precedent and termination rights that could be implicated by the 2019 Kincade fire and any future post-petition wildfire during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility may not be able to satisfy, or obtain a waiver of, such conditions precedent to the commitments, or the Backstop Parties or the Commitment Parties, respectively, may have the right to terminate such commitments, which would jeopardize PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to finance the Proposed Plan. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility may not be able to obtain alternative financing to the transactions contemplated by the Backstop Commitment Letters and the Debt Commitment Letters, and may not be able to obtain financing for an alternative plan that may be proposed by PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility after the impact of the 2019 Kincade fire is better known. 
Finally, the 2019 Kincade fire or a future post-petition wildfire could have adverse consequences on the Utility&#8217;s probation proceeding, the Utility&#8217;s proceedings with the CPUC and FERC (including the Safety Culture OII and the Chapter 11 Proceedings OII), the criminal investigation into the 2018 Camp fire and future regulatory proceedings, including future applications for the safety certification required by AB 1054. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility may also suffer additional reputational harm and face an even more challenging operating, political, and regulatory environment. For more information about the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires, see &#8220;2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires&#8221; in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 
The amount of potential losses resulting from the impact of the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires is expected to greatly exceed the amount of PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s insurance coverage for wildfire events. The amount of potential losses resulting from the impact of the 2019 Kincade fire could also exceed the amount of PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s insurance coverage for wildfires. Securing liability insurance in future years is expected to be increasingly difficult and expensive, if available at all. 
The amount of potential losses resulting from the impact of the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires is expected to greatly exceed the amount of PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s insurance coverage for wildfire events. The amount of potential losses resulting from the impact of the 2019 Kincade fire could also exceed the amount of PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s insurance coverage for wildfire events. Even if the Utility satisfies the eligibility and other requirements to participate in the Wildfire Fund under AB 1054, the recovery of any such excess losses from the Wildfire Fund would be capped at 40%. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility had liability insurance coverage for wildfire events in an aggregate amount of approximately $1.4 billion for the period from August 1, 2018 through July 31, 2019, comprised of $700 million for general liability (subject to an initial self-insured retention of $10 million per occurrence), and $700 million for property damages only, which property damage coverage includes an aggregate amount of approximately $200 million through the reinsurance market where a catastrophe bond was utilized. Further, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have liability insurance coverage for wildfire events in an amount of $430 million (subject to an initial self-insured retention of $10 million per occurrence) for the period of August 1, 2019 through July 31, 2020, and $1 billion in liability insurance coverage for non-wildfire events (subject to an initial self-insured retention of $10 million per occurrence), comprised of $520 million for the period of August 1, 2019 through July 31, 2020 and $480 million for the period of September 3, 2019 through September 2, 2020. In addition, coverage limits within these wildfire insurance policies could result in further material self-insured costs in the event each fire were deemed to be a separate occurrence under the terms of the insurance policies. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s cost of obtaining the wildfire and non-wildfire insurance coverage in place for the period of August 1, 2019 through September 2, 2020 is approximately $212 million, compared to the approximately $50 million that the Utility recovered in rates during the year ended December 31, 2019. If PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are unable to recover the full amount of their insurance, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. In addition, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility expect their losses in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires will greatly exceed their available insurance, and the Utility could also be subject to significant liability in excess of insurance in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire. For a discussion of the potential magnitude of PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s liability, see &#8220;PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by potential losses resulting from the impact of the 2018 Camp fire and the 2017 Northern California wildfires and other pre-petition fires (including the 2015 Butte fire), notwithstanding the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases&#8221; and &#8220;PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected as a result of the 2019 Kincade fire and any future post-petition wildfire during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases.&#8221; above. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility also expect to face increasing difficulty securing liability insurance in future years due to availability and to face significantly increased insurance costs. 
If the Utility is unable to recover all or a significant portion of its excess costs in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2015 Butte fire through ratemaking mechanisms and in a timely manner, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
As of December 31, 2019, the Utility incurred substantial costs in connection with the 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2015 Butte fire in excess of costs currently in rates, some of which currently are or are expected to be recorded in the future in its WEMA account. The Utility could similarly incur substantial costs in excess of insurance coverage in the future in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire. 
There can be no assurance that the Utility will be allowed to recover costs in excess of insurance, including costs recorded in those accounts in the future, even if a court decision were to determine that the Utility is liable as a result of the application of the doctrine of inverse condemnation. 
SB 901, signed into law on September 21, 2018, required the CPUC to establish a CHT, directing the CPUC to limit certain disallowances in the aggregate, so that they do not exceed the maximum amount that the Utility can pay without harming ratepayers or materially impacting its ability to provide adequate and safe service. SB 901 also authorized the CPUC to issue a financing order that permits recovery, through the issuance of recovery bonds (also referred to as &#8220;securitization&#8221;), of wildfire-related costs found to be just and reasonable by the CPUC and, only for the 2017 Northern California wildfires, any amounts in excess of the CHT. SB 901 does not authorize securitization with respect to possible 2018 Camp fire costs, as the bill does not address fires that occurred in 2018. 
After a CPUC July 8, 2019 decision determined that a utility that has filed for relief under Chapter 11 cannot access the CHT, on August 7, 2019, the Utility submitted to the CPUC an application for rehearing of that decision, the outcome of which is uncertain. For more information on the OIR, see &#8220;OIR to Implement Public Utilities Code Section 451.2 Regarding Criteria and Methodology for Wildfire Cost Recovery Pursuant to Senate Bill 901&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A. 
The inability to recover all or a significant portion of costs in excess of insurance through increases in rates and by collecting such rates in a timely manner could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected in the event of further non-compliance with the terms of probation or in the event of further modifications to the conditions of probation. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected in the event of further non-compliance with the terms of probation or in the event of further modifications to the conditions of probation. On January 26, 2017, following the federal criminal trial against the Utility in connection with the San Bruno explosion, in which the Utility was found guilty on six felony counts, the Utility was sentenced to, among other things, a five-year corporate probation period and oversight by a third-party monitor for a period of five years, with the ability to apply for early termination after three years. The probation includes a requirement that the Utility not commit any local, state, or federal crimes during the probation period. As part of the probation, the Utility has retained a third-party monitor at the Utility&#8217;s expense. The goal of the third-party monitor is to help ensure that the Utility takes reasonable and appropriate steps to maintain the safety of its gas and electric operations, and to maintain effective ethics, compliance and safety related incentive programs on a Utility-wide basis. 
In 2018 and 2019, the court overseeing the Utility&#8217;s probation issued various orders related to the Utility&#8217;s probation, including a finding that the Utility had violated a condition of its probation with respect to reporting requirements, and imposing new conditions of probation. For more information about the Utility&#8217;s probation and the court&#8217;s orders, see &#8220;U.S. District Court Matters and Probation&#8221; in Item 3. Such proceedings are not subject to the automatic stay imposed as a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases. 
The Utility could incur material costs, not recoverable through rates, in the event of further non-compliance with the terms of its probation and in connection with the monitorship (including but not limited to costs resulting from recommendations of the third-party monitor). The Utility could also incur material costs, not recoverable through rates, in the event of further modifications to the conditions of its probation, such as those proposed by the court overseeing the Utility&#8217;s probation on January 16, 2020, relating to the hiring of additional contractors to ensure full compliance with certain vegetation management conditions. 
The outcome of probation could harm the Utility&#8217;s relationships with customers, regulators, legislators, communities, business partners, or other constituencies and make it more difficult to recruit qualified personnel and senior management. Further, it could negatively affect the outcome of future ratemaking and regulatory proceedings and result in increased regulatory or legislative scrutiny, including with respect to various aspects of how the Utility&#8217;s business is conducted or organized. (See &#8220;Enforcement and Litigation Matters&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A.) 
The doctrine of inverse condemnation, if applied by courts in litigation to which PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility are subject, could significantly expand the potential liabilities from such litigation and materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
California law includes a doctrine of inverse condemnation that is routinely invoked in California. Inverse condemnation imposes strict liability (including liability for attorneys&#8217; fees) for damages as a result of the design, construction and maintenance of utility facilities, including utilities&#8217; electric transmission lines. Courts have imposed liability under the doctrine of inverse condemnation in legal actions brought by property holders against utilities on the grounds that losses borne by the person whose property was damaged through a public use undertaking should be spread across the community that benefitted from such undertaking, and based on the assumption that utilities have the ability to recover these costs from their customers. Plaintiffs have asserted the doctrine of inverse condemnation in lawsuits related to the 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2015 Butte fire, and courts have ruled that the doctrine can apply to PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility in those matters. While the Utility currently continues to litigate this issue, there can be no assurance that the Utility will be successful in overturning the rulings that inverse condemnation applies in the 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2015 Butte fire or other litigation against PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility. 
Furthermore, a court could determine that the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies even in the absence of an open CPUC proceeding for cost recovery, or before a potential cost recovery decision is issued by the CPUC. Although the imposition of liability under the doctrine of inverse condemnation is premised on the assumption that utilities have the ability to automatically recover these costs from their customers, there can be no assurance that the CPUC would authorize cost recovery whether or not a previous court decision had imposed liability on a utility under the doctrine of inverse condemnation. (In December 2017, the CPUC denied recovery of costs that San Diego Gas &#38; Electric Company stated it incurred as a result of the doctrine of inverse condemnation, holding that the inverse condemnation principles of strict liability are not relevant to the CPUC&#8217;s prudent manager standard. That determination was challenged by San Diego Gas &#38; Electric as well as by the Utility and Southern California Edison. In October 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the case, effectively ending the challenge.) 
If PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility were to be found liable for damages under the doctrine of inverse condemnation, but the Utility was unable to secure a cost recovery decision from the CPUC to pay for such costs through increases in rates or to collect such rates in a timely manner, the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility would be materially affected by potential losses resulting from the impact of the 2019 Kincade fire, and, if the TCC RSA, Subrogation RSA, or PSAs were to be terminated, the 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2015 Butte fire. (See &#8220;PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by potential losses resulting from the impact of the 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 Northern California wildfires and other pre-petition fires (including the 2015 Butte fire), notwithstanding the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases,&#8221; and &#8220;PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected as a result of the 2019 Kincade fire and any future post-petition wildfire during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases&#8221; above.) 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected as a result of the Utility&#8217;s implementation of its PSPS program. 
As outlined in the 2019 Wildfire Mitigation Plan, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have adopted the PSPS program to proactively de-energize lines that traverse areas under elevated and extreme risks for wildfire when forecasts predict extreme fire-threat conditions. In addition to the 2019 PSPS events, the Utility expects that PSPS events will be necessary in 2020 and future years. Approximately 5.4 million electric customer premises may potentially be impacted by PSPS events. 
Since June 2019, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have carried out several PSPS events. These PSPS events have been subject to significant scrutiny and criticism by various stakeholders, including the California Governor, the CPUC and the court overseeing the Utility&#8217;s probation. On November 12, 2019, the CPUC issued an order to show cause why the Utility should not be sanctioned for alleged violations of law related to its communications with customers, coordination with local governments, and communications with critical facilities and public safety partners during the PSPS events in late 2019. On November 13, 2019, the CPUC instituted an OII to examine 2019 PSPS events carried out by California&#8217;s investor-owned utilities and to consider enforcement actions. The Utility also is the subject of a class action litigation in connection with the 2019 PSPS events that was filed in the Bankruptcy Court in December of 2019. On January 24, 2020, the assigned ALJ issued a proposed decision in the 2020 Energy Resource Recovery Account (ERRA) Forecast proceeding that, if finalized, would require the Utility to include in its application for the 2019 ERRA Compliance Review an accounting of the PSPS events that occurred in its service territory in 2019 and how the PSPS impacted its revenue collections. Also, on January 27, 2020, the California state senate approved SB 378 that, if passed by the assembly and then enacted into law, would require the CPUC, on or before June 1, 2021, to establish a procedure for customers, local governments, and others affected by a de-energization event to recover specified costs incurred as a result of the de-energization event from an electrical corporation within specified time periods. The bill would also require the CPUC to establish rules determining whether these payments can be recovered from ratepayers. 
In addition, the proposal of SB 378, which would impose penalties and other requirements on electric utility companies relating to PSPS events, could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. In addition to other requirements, SB 378 would impose on an electric utility company a civil penalty of at least $250,000 per 50,000 affected customers for every hour that a PSPS event is in place, would require the CPUC to establish a procedure for customers, local governments and others to recover specified costs incurred during a PSPS event from the electric utility company, which cost recovery would be borne by shareholders, and would prohibit an electric utility company from billing customers for any nonfixed costs during a PSPS event. 
Further, the proposals of AB 1941 could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. AB 1941 proposes to suspend RPS requirements, determine the savings to electric utility companies from the suspension and direct those savings towards system hardening to mitigate wildfire risks and PSPS impacts, and would prohibit salary increases or bonuses to executive officers during the suspension of RPS requirements. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility cannot predict the timing and outcome of the OII, order to show cause, the class action litigation, and pending litigation. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility could be subject to additional investigations, regulatory proceedings or other enforcement actions as well as to additional litigation and claims by customers as a result of the Utility&#8217;s implementation of its PSPS program, including with respect to the October 9, 2019 PSPS event, which could result in fines, penalties, customer rebates or other payments. The amount of any fines, penalties, customer rebates or other payments (if PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility were to issue any credits, rebates or other payments in connection with any other PSPS events (whether past events or in the future)) or liability for damages could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. In addition, the PSPS program has had an adverse impact on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s reputation with customers, regulators and policymakers and future PSPS events may increase these negative perceptions. 
Risks Related to the Outcome of Other Enforcement Matters, Investigations, and Regulatory Proceedings 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected as a result of legislative and regulatory developments. 
The Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected as a result of SB 901 adopted in 2018 by the California legislature. In December 2018, the CPUC opened an OIR in connection with SB 901 that will adopt criteria and a methodology for use by the CPUC in future applications for cost recovery of wildfire costs. After a CPUC July 8, 2019 decision determined that a utility that has filed for relief under Chapter 11 cannot access the CHT, on August 7, 2019, the Utility submitted to the CPUC an application for rehearing of that decision, the outcome of which is uncertain. Failure to obtain a substantial or full recovery of costs related to wildfires could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. (See &#8220;Regulatory Matters - Other Regulatory Proceedings&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A.) 
In addition, SB 901 requires utilities to submit annual wildfire mitigation plans for approval by the CPUC on a schedule to be established by the CPUC. SB 901 establishes factors to be considered by the CPUC when setting penalties for failure to substantially comply with the plan. Failure to substantially comply with the plan could result in fines and other penalties imposed on the Utility that could be material. &#160; (See &#8220;Regulatory Matters &#8211; Other Regulatory Proceedings&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A.) 
On July 12, 2019, the California Governor signed into law AB 1054, which, among other policy reforms, provides for the establishment of a statewide fund that is available for eligible electric utility companies to pay eligible claims for liabilities arising from wildfires occurring after July 12, 2019 that are caused by the applicable electric utility company&#8217;s equipment. Although PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have delivered notice to the CPUC electing to participate in the Wildfire Fund and even if the Utility were eligible to do so, the impact of AB 1054 on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility is subject to numerous uncertainties, including the Utility&#8217;s ability to demonstrate to the CPUC that wildfire-related costs paid from the Wildfire Fund are just and reasonable, subject to a disallowance cap, and that the Wildfire Fund has sufficient remaining funds. 
The costs of participating in the Wildfire Fund (should the Utility be eligible to do so) are expected to exceed $6.7 billion over the anticipated ten-year life of the fund. The timing and amount of any potential charges associated with shareholder contributions would also depend on various factors, including the timing of resolution of the Chapter 11 Cases. In addition, there could also be a significant delay between the occurrence of a wildfire and the timing on which the Utility recognizes impairment for the reduction in future coverage, due to the lack of data available to the Utility following a catastrophic event, especially if the wildfire occurs in the service territory of another participating electric utility. Participation in the Wildfire Fund is expected to have a material impact on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows, and there can be no assurance that the benefits of participating in the Wildfire Fund ultimately outweigh these substantial costs. 
Finally, AB 1054 revised some of the SB 901 requirements regarding wildfire mitigation plans, including creating a Wildfire Safety Division to review future plans and that plans should cover a three-year period. 
Also, in June 2018, the State of California enacted the CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, with a 12-month look-back period requiring compliance by January 1, 2019. On October 11, 2019, the State of California announced proposed regulations which provide guidance on the requirements of the CCPA. The CCPA requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices, allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and provides a new cause of action for data breaches. The CCPA provides for financial penalties in the event of non-compliance and statutory damages in the event of a data security breach. Failure to comply with the CCPA could result in fines imposed on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility that could be material. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by the ability of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility to participate in the Wildfire Fund under AB 1054, which is subject to numerous uncertainties and which could involve significant organizational or governance changes. 
The Utility&#8217;s ability to participate in the Wildfire Fund is subject to numerous eligibility and other requirements set forth in AB 1054, including, among others, (a) the Utility&#8217;s Chapter 11 Case has been resolved pursuant to a plan of reorganization by June 30, 2020, (b) the CPUC has approved the Utility&#8217;s plan of reorganization, including the Utility&#8217;s resulting governance structure as being acceptable in light of the Utility&#8217;s safety history, criminal probation, recent financial condition and other factors deemed relevant by the CPUC, and (c) the CPUC has determined that the Utility&#8217;s plan of reorganization is (i) consistent with California&#8217;s climate goals and (ii) neutral, on average, to the Utility&#8217;s ratepayers. (See &#8220;Assembly Bill 1054&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A.) There can be no assurance that PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility will be able to meet these eligibility and other requirements for participating in the Wildfire Fund, including that the CPUC will issue the necessary approvals or make the necessary determinations. 
On October 4, 2019, the CPUC issued an OII to consider the ratemaking and other implications &#8220;that will result from the confirmation of a plan of reorganization and other regulatory approvals necessary to resolve&#8221; the Chapter 11 Cases (the &#8220;Chapter 11 Proceedings OII&#8221;). The scope of the Chapter 11 Proceedings OII includes, among others, any regulatory approvals required in order for PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility to become eligible to participate in the Wildfire Fund and any other regulatory approvals required by AB 1054. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility cannot predict the outcome of the Chapter 11 Proceedings OII. 
Additionally, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to meet the eligibility and other requirements may be adversely impacted by the California Governor&#8217;s review of the Proposed Plan that PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility filed with the Bankruptcy Court on January 31, 2020. 
Failure to meet the eligibility conditions to access relief under the Wildfire Fund, including satisfaction of the eligibility requirements described above and the Utility making its initial contribution thereto, would preclude PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility from accessing the Wildfire Fund for future wildfire-related claims and any related benefits, including the disallowance cap, and could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The Utility is subject to extensive regulations and the risk of enforcement proceedings in connection with compliance with such regulations. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by the outcomes of the CPUC&#8217;s investigative enforcement proceedings against the Utility, other known enforcement matters, and other ongoing state and federal investigations and requests for information. 
The Utility is subject to extensive regulations, including federal, state and local energy, environmental and other laws and regulations, and the risk of enforcement proceedings in connection with compliance with such regulations. The Utility could incur material charges, including fines and other penalties, in connection with the Wildfires OII, the locate and mark OII, the order to show cause related to the 2019 PSPS events, the safety culture OII, and other matters that the CPUC&#8217;s SED may be investigating. The SED could launch investigations at any time on any issue it deems appropriate. Such proceedings are likely not subject to the automatic stay imposed as a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases; however, collection efforts in connection with fines or penalties arising out of such proceedings are stayed. 
The SED has discretion whether to issue a penalty for each violation, but if it assesses a penalty for a violation, it may impose the maximum statutory penalty of $50,000, per penalty, per day, with an administrative limit of $8 million per citation issued. For offenses occurred after January 1, 2019, the maximum statutory penalty is $100,000, per penalty, per day. The SED may, at its discretion, impose penalties on a daily basis, or on less than a daily basis, for violations that continued for more than one day. The SED may also issue multiple citations per violation or address multiple violations in a single citation. While it is uncertain how the CPUC would calculate the number of violations or the penalty for any violations, such fines or penalties could be significant and materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s liquidity and results of operations. (See &#8220;Regulatory Environment&#8221; in Item 1. Business and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) 
The Utility could be subject to additional regulatory or governmental enforcement action in the future with respect to compliance with federal, state or local laws, regulations or orders that could result in additional fines, penalties or customer refunds, including those regarding renewable energy and resource adequacy requirements; customer billing; customer service; affiliate transactions; vegetation management; design, construction, operating and maintenance practices; safety and inspection practices; compliance with CPUC general orders or other applicable CPUC decisions or regulations; federal electric reliability standards; and environmental compliance. CPUC staff could also impose penalties on the Utility in the future in accordance with its authority under the gas and electric safety citation programs. The amount of such fines, penalties, or customer refunds could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The Utility also is a target of a number of investigations, in addition to certain investigations in connection with the wildfires. (See &#8220;Risks Related to Wildfires,&#8221; above.) The Utility is unable to predict the outcome of pending investigation, including whether any charges will be brought against the Utility, or the amount of any costs and expenses associated with such investigations. 
If these investigations result in enforcement action against the Utility, the Utility could incur additional fines or penalties the amount of which could be substantial and, in the event of a judgment against the Utility, suffer further ongoing negative consequences. Furthermore, a negative outcome in any of these investigations, or future enforcement actions, could negatively affect the outcome of future ratemaking and regulatory proceedings to which the Utility may be subject; for example, by enabling parties to challenge the Utility&#8217;s request to recover costs that the parties allege are somehow related to the Utility&#8217;s violations. (See also &#8220;PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected in the event of non-compliance with the terms of probation or in the event of modifications to the conditions of probation&#8221; above.) 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results primarily depend on the outcomes of regulatory and ratemaking proceedings and the Utility&#8217;s ability to manage its operating expenses and capital expenditures so that it is able to earn its authorized rate of return in a timely manner. 
As a regulated entity, the Utility&#8217;s rates are set by the CPUC or the FERC on a prospective basis and are generally designed to allow the Utility to collect sufficient revenues to recover reasonable costs of providing service, including a return on its capital investments. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected if the CPUC or the FERC does not authorize sufficient revenues for the Utility to safely and reliably serve its customers and earn its authorized ROE. The outcome of the Utility&#8217;s ratemaking proceedings can be affected by many factors, including the level of opposition by intervening parties; potential rate impacts; increasing levels of regulatory review; changes in the political, regulatory, or legislative environments; and the opinions of the Utility&#8217;s regulators, consumer and other stakeholder organizations, and customers, about the Utility&#8217;s ability to provide safe, reliable, and affordable electric and gas services. Further, an increase in the amount of capacity located in the Utility&#8217;s service territory that is procured by the CAISO under Reliability Must Run (&#8220;RMR&#8221;) contracts could increase the Utility&#8217;s costs of procuring capacity needed for reliable service to its customers. 
In addition to the amount of authorized revenues, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected if the Utility&#8217;s actual costs to safely and reliably serve its customers differ from authorized or forecast costs. The Utility may incur additional costs for many reasons including changing market circumstances, unanticipated events (such as wildfires, storms, earthquakes, accidents, or catastrophic or other events affecting the Utility&#8217;s operations), or compliance with new state laws or policies. Although the Utility may be allowed to recover some or all of the additional costs, there may be a substantial delay between when the Utility incurs the costs and when the Utility is authorized to collect revenues to recover such costs. Alternatively, the CPUC or the FERC may disallow costs that they determine were not reasonably or prudently incurred by the Utility. 
The Utility also is required to incur costs to comply with legislative and regulatory requirements and initiatives, such as those relating to the development of a state-wide electric vehicle charging infrastructure, the deployment of distributed energy resources, implementation of demand response and customer energy efficiency programs, energy storage and renewable energy targets, underground gas storage, and the construction of the California high-speed rail project. The Utility&#8217;s ability to recover costs, including its investments, associated with these and other legislative and regulatory initiatives will depend, in large part, on the final form of legislative or regulatory requirements, and the associated ratemaking mechanisms associated with these initiatives, including the timely adjustment of such mechanisms to reflect any lowered customer demand for the Utility&#8217;s electricity and natural gas services. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results depend upon the Utility&#8217;s continuing ability to recover &#8220;pass-through&#8221; costs, including electricity and natural gas procurement costs, from customers in a timely manner. The CPUC may disallow procurement costs for a variety of reasons. In addition, the Utility&#8217;s ability to recover these costs could be affected by the loss of Utility customers and decreased new customer growth, if the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility&#8217;s rates to reflect such events. 
The Utility meets customer demand for electricity from a variety of sources, including electricity generated from the Utility&#8217;s own generation facilities, electricity provided by third parties under power purchase agreements, and purchases on the wholesale electricity market. The Utility must manage these sources using the commercial and CPUC regulatory principles of &#8220;least cost dispatch&#8221; and prudent administration of power purchase agreements in compliance with its CPUC-approved long-term procurement plan. The CPUC could disallow procurement costs incurred by the Utility if the CPUC determines that the Utility did not comply with these principles or if the Utility did not comply with its procurement plan. 
Further, the contractual prices for electricity under the Utility&#8217;s current or future power purchase agreements could become uneconomic in the future for a variety of reasons, including developments in alternative energy technology, increased self-generation by customers, an increase in distributed generation, and lower customer demand due to adverse economic conditions or the loss of the Utility&#8217;s customers to other retail providers. Despite the CPUC&#8217;s current approval of the contracts, the CPUC could disallow contract costs in the future if it determines that the terms of such contracts, including price, do not meet the CPUC reasonableness standard. 
The Utility&#8217;s ability to recover the costs it incurs in the wholesale electricity market may be affected by whether the CAISO wholesale electricity market continues to function effectively. Although market mechanisms are designed to limit excessive prices, these market mechanisms could fail, or the related systems and software on which the market mechanisms rely may not perform as intended which could result in excessive market prices. The CPUC could prohibit the Utility from passing through the higher costs of electricity to customers. 
Further, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be affected by the loss of Utility customers and decreasing bundled load that occurs through municipalization of the Utility&#8217;s facilities, an increase in the number of CCAs that provide electricity to their residents, and an increase in the number of consumers who become direct access customers of alternative generation providers. (See &#8220;Competition in the Electricity Industry&#8221; in Item 1.) As the number of bundled customers (i.e., those customers who receive electricity and distribution service from the Utility) declines, the rates for remaining customers could increase as the Utility would have a smaller customer base from which to recover certain procurement costs. Although the Utility is permitted to collect non-bypassable charges for above market generation-related costs incurred on behalf of former customers, the charges may not be sufficient for the Utility to fully recover these costs. In addition, the Utility&#8217;s ability to collect non-bypassable charges has been, and may continue to be, challenged by certain customer groups. Furthermore, if the former customers return to receiving electricity supply from the Utility, the Utility could incur costs to meet their electricity needs that it may not be able to timely recover through rates or that it may not be able to recover at all. 
In addition, increasing levels of self-generation of electricity by customers (primarily solar installations) and the use of customer NEM, which allows self-generating customers to receive bill credits for surplus power at the full retail rate, puts upward rate pressure on remaining customers, who may incur significantly higher bills due to an increase in customers seeking alternative energy providers. 
A confluence of technology-related cost declines and sustained federal or state subsidies could make a combination of distributed generation and energy storage a viable, cost-effective alternative to the Utility&#8217;s bundled electric service which could further threaten the Utility&#8217;s ability to recover its generation, transmission, and distribution investments. If the number of the Utility&#8217;s customers decreases or grows at a slower rate than anticipated, the Utility&#8217;s level of authorized capital investment could decline as well, leading to a slower growth in rate base and earnings. Reduced energy demand or significantly slowed growth in demand due to customer migration to other energy providers, adoption of energy efficient technology, conservation, increasing levels of distributed generation and self-generation, unless substantially offset through regulatory cost allocations, could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
Further, changes in commodity prices also may have an adverse effect on the Utility&#8217;s ability to timely recover its operating costs and earn its authorized ROE. Although the Utility generally recovers its electricity and natural gas procurement costs from customers as &#8220;pass-through&#8221; costs, a significant and sustained rise in commodity prices could create overall rate pressures that make it more difficult for the Utility to recover its costs that are not categorized as &#8220;pass-through&#8221; costs. To relieve some of this upward rate pressure, the CPUC could authorize lower revenues than the Utility requested or disallow full cost recovery. 
If the Utility is unable to recover a material portion of its procurement costs and/or if the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility&#8217;s rates to reflect the impact of changing loads, the wide deployment of distributed generation, and the development of new electricity generation and energy storage technologies, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
Risks Related to Operations and Information Technology 
The Utility&#8217;s electricity and natural gas operations are inherently hazardous and involve significant risks which, if they materialize, can materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The Utility owns and operates extensive electricity and natural gas facilities, including two nuclear generation units and an extensive hydroelectric generating system. (See &#8220;Electric Utility Operations&#8221; and &#8220;Natural Gas Utility Operations&#8221; in Item 1. Business above.) The Utility&#8217;s ability to earn its authorized ROE depends on its ability to efficiently maintain, operate, and protect its facilities, and provide electricity and natural gas services safely and reliably. The Utility undertakes substantial capital investment projects to construct, replace, and improve its electricity and natural gas facilities. In addition, the Utility is obligated to decommission its electricity generation facilities at the end of their useful operating lives, and the CPUC approved retirement of Diablo Canyon by 2024 and 2025. 
The Utility&#8217;s ability to safely and reliably operate, maintain, construct and decommission its facilities is subject to numerous risks, many of which are beyond the Utility&#8217;s control, including those that arise from: 
The occurrence of any of these events could interrupt fuel supplies; affect demand for electricity or natural gas; cause unplanned outages or reduce generating output; damage the Utility&#8217;s assets or operations; damage the assets or operations of third parties on which the Utility relies; damage property owned by customers or others; and cause personal injury or death. As a result, the Utility could incur costs to purchase replacement power, to repair assets and restore service, and to compensate third parties. Any of such incidents also could lead to significant claims against the Utility. 
The adverse impact of the occurrence of any of these events may be exacerbated by the difficulty PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility may experience in making sufficient capital expenditure as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases. For the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases, the Utility&#8217;s ability to finance capital expenditures and pay other ongoing expenses will primarily depend on the levels of its operating cash flows and availability under the DIP Credit Agreement. In the event that PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s capital needs increase materially due to unexpected events or transactions including but not limited to the events described above, additional financing outside of the DIP Facilities may be required, and there can be no assurance that PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility will be able to obtain such additional financing on favorable terms or at all, or that such additional financing will be approved by the Bankruptcy Court. In the event that PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are unable to obtain such additional financing on favorable terms or at all, or are unable to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval of such additional financing, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility may be unable to make necessary capital expenditures in connection with the occurrence of any of the above events. For more information on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s material commitments for capital expenditures, see &#8220;Regulatory Matters&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A. 
Further, although the Utility often enters into agreements for third-party contractors to perform work, such as patrolling and inspection of facilities, vegetation management, or the construction or demolition or facilities, the Utility may retain liability for the quality and completion of the contractor&#8217;s work and can be subject to penalties or other enforcement action if the contractor violates applicable laws, rules, regulations, or orders. The Utility may also be subject to liability, penalties or other enforcement action as a result of personal injury or death caused by third-party contractor actions. 
Insurance, equipment warranties, or other contractual indemnification requirements may not be sufficient or effective to provide full or even partial recovery under all circumstances or against all hazards or liabilities to which the Utility may become subject. An uninsured loss could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The Utility&#8217;s insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover losses caused by an operating failure or catastrophic events, including severe weather events, or may not be available at a reasonable cost, or available at all. 
The Utility has experienced increased costs and difficulties in obtaining insurance coverage for wildfires and other risks that could arise from the Utility&#8217;s ordinary operations. PG&#38;E Corporation, the Utility or its contractors and customers could continue to experience coverage reductions and/or increased insurance costs in future years. No assurance can be given that future losses will not exceed the limits of the Utility&#8217;s insurance coverage. Uninsured losses and increases in the cost of insurance may not be recoverable in customer rates. A loss that is not fully insured or cannot be recovered in customer rates could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
As a result of the potential application to investor-owned utilities of a strict liability standard under the doctrine of inverse condemnation, recent losses recorded by insurance companies, the risk of increased wildfires including as a result of climate change, the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 Northern California wildfires, and the 2015 Butte fire, the Utility may not be able to obtain sufficient insurance coverage in the future at a reasonable cost, or at all. In addition, the Utility is unable to predict whether it would be allowed to recover in rates the increased costs of insurance or the costs of any uninsured losses. 
If the amount of insurance is insufficient or otherwise unavailable, or if the Utility is unable to obtain insurance at a reasonable cost or recover in rates the costs of any uninsured losses, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
The electric power and gas industries are undergoing significant changes driven by technological advancements and a decarbonized economy, which could materially affect the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The electric power industry is undergoing transformative change driven by technological advancements enabling customer choice (for example, customer-owned generation and energy storage) and state climate policy supporting a decarbonized economy. The electric grid is a critical enabler of the adoption of new energy technologies that support California&#8217;s climate change and GHG reduction objectives, which continue to be publicly supported by California policymakers. California's environmental policy objectives are accelerating the pace and scope of the industry change. For instance, SB 100, which was signed into law on September 10, 2018, increases from 50% to 60%, the percentage of California&#8217;s electricity portfolio that must come from renewables by 2030. SB 100 establishes a further goal to have an electric grid that is entirely powered by clean energy by 2045. California utilities also are experiencing increasing deployment by customers and third parties of DERs, such as on-site solar generation, energy storage, fuel cells, energy efficiency, and demand response technologies. These developments will require modernization of the electric distribution grid to, among other things, accommodate two-way flows of electricity, increase the grid&#8217;s capacity, and interconnect DERs. 
In order to enable the California clean energy economy, sustained investments are required in grid modernization, renewable integration projects, energy efficiency programs, energy storage options, EV infrastructure and state infrastructure modernization (e.g., rail and water projects). 
To this end, the CPUC is conducting proceedings to: evaluate changes to the planning and operation of the electric distribution grid in order to prepare for higher penetration of DERs and, consider future grid modernization and grid reinforcement investments; evaluate if traditional grid investments can be deferred by DERs, and if feasible, what, if any, compensation to utilities would be appropriate for enabling those investments; and clarify the role of the electric distribution grid operator. The CPUC also authorized development of two new, five-year programs aimed at accelerating widespread electric vehicle adoption and combating climate change. The new programs will increase fast charging options for consumers as well as electric charging infrastructure for non-light-duty fleet vehicles. 
In addition, in light of the state&#8217;s commitment to clean energy and carbon neutral economy by 2045, California has recently proposed public policies that prohibit or restrict the use and consumption of natural gas, for example in buildings, that will have for effect to reduce the use of natural gas. Reducing natural gas use could lead to a reduction in the gas customer base and a diminished need for gas infrastructure and, as a result, could lead to certain gas assets no longer be &#8220;used and useful,&#8221; potentially causing substantial investment value of gas assets to be stranded. (Under the CPUC rules, when an asset no longer meets the standard of &#8220;used and useful,&#8221; the utility no longer recovers the costs from its customers or earns the associated rate of return.) However, while natural gas demand is projected to decline over time, the costs of operating a safe and reliable gas delivery system in California have been increasing, among other things, to cover the cost of long-term pipeline safety enhancements. Inability by the Utility to recover in rates its investments into the natural gas system while still ensuring gas system safety and reliability could materially affect the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The industry changes, costs associated with complying with new regulatory developments and initiatives and with technological advancements, or the Utility&#8217;s inability to successfully adapt to changes in the electric and gas industry, could materially affect the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
A cyber incident, cyber security breach, severe natural event or physical attack on the Utility&#8217;s operational networks and information technology systems could have a material effect on its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The Utility&#8217;s electricity and natural gas systems rely on a complex, interconnected network of generation, transmission, distribution, control, and communication technologies, which can be damaged by natural events-such as severe weather or seismic events-and by malicious events, such as cyber and physical attacks. Private and public entities, such as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and U.S. Government Departments, including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Energy, and the White House, have noted that cyber-attacks targeting utility systems are increasing in sophistication, magnitude, and frequency. The Utility&#8217;s operational networks also may face new cyber security risks due to modernizing and interconnecting the existing infrastructure with new technologies and control systems. Any failure or decrease in the functionality of the Utility&#8217;s operational networks could cause harm to the public or employees, significantly disrupt operations, negatively impact the Utility&#8217;s ability to safely generate, transport, deliver and store energy and gas or otherwise operate in the most safe and efficient manner or at all, and damage the Utility&#8217;s assets or operations or those of third parties. 
The Utility also relies on complex information technology systems that allow it to create, collect, use, disclose, store and otherwise process sensitive information, including the Utility&#8217;s financial information, customer energy usage and billing information, and personal information regarding customers, employees and their dependents, contractors, and other individuals. In addition, the Utility often relies on third-party vendors to host, maintain, modify, and update its systems, and to provide other services to the Utility or the Utility&#8217;s customers. In addition, the Utility is increasingly being required to disclose large amounts of data (including customer energy usage and personal information regarding customers) to support changes to California&#8217;s electricity market related to grid modernization and customer choice. These third-party vendors could cease to exist, fail to establish adequate processes to protect the Utility&#8217;s systems and information, or experience security incidents or inadequate security measures. Any incidents or disruptions in the Utility&#8217;s information technology systems could impact the Utility&#8217;s ability to track or collect revenues and to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting. 
The Utility and its third-party vendors have been subject to, and will likely continue to be subject to, breaches and attempts to gain unauthorized access to the Utility&#8217;s information technology systems or confidential data (including information about customers and employees), or to disrupt the Utility&#8217;s operations. None of these breaches or attempts has individually or in the aggregate resulted in a security incident with a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. Despite implementation of security and control measures, there can be no assurance that the Utility will be able to prevent unauthorized access to its operational networks, information technology systems or data, or the disruption of its operations. Such events could subject the Utility to significant expenses, claims by customers or third parties, government inquiries, penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, investigations, and regulatory actions that could result in material fines and penalties, loss of customers and harm to PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s reputation, any of which could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The Utility maintains cyber liability insurance that covers certain damages caused by cyber incidents. However, there is no guarantee that adequate insurance will continue to be available at rates the Utility believes are reasonable or that the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident will be covered by insurance or recoverable in rates. 
The operation and decommissioning of the Utility&#8217;s nuclear generation facilities expose it to potentially significant liabilities and the Utility may not be able to fully recover its costs if regulatory requirements change or the facilities cease operations before the licenses expire. 
The operation of the Utility&#8217;s nuclear generation facilities exposes it to potentially significant liabilities from environmental, health and financial risks, such as risks relating to the storage, handling and disposal of spent nuclear fuel, and the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity, natural disaster, or terrorist act. If the Utility incurs losses that are either not covered by insurance or exceed the amount of insurance available, such losses could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. In addition, the Utility may be required under federal law to pay up to $275 million of liabilities arising out of each nuclear incident occurring not only at the Utility&#8217;s Diablo Canyon facility but at any other nuclear power plant in the United States. 
On January 11, 2018, the CPUC approved the retirement of Diablo Canyon units by 2024 and 2025. However, the Utility continues to face public concern about the safety of nuclear generation and nuclear fuel. Some of these nuclear opposition groups regularly file petitions at the NRC and in other forums challenging the actions of the NRC and urging governmental entities to adopt laws or policies in opposition to nuclear power. Although an action in opposition may ultimately fail, regulatory proceedings may take longer to conclude and be more costly to complete. It is also possible that public pressure could grow leading to adverse changes in legislation, regulations, orders, or their interpretation. As a result, operations at the Utility&#8217;s two nuclear generation units at Diablo Canyon could cease before their respective licenses expire in 2024 and 2025. In such an instance, the Utility could be required to record a charge for the remaining amount of its unrecovered investment and such charge could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
In addition, in order to retain highly skilled personnel necessary to safely operate Diablo Canyon during the remaining years of operations, the Utility will incur costs in connection with (i) an employee retention program to ensure adequate staffing levels at Diablo Canyon, which program has been approved by the CPUC, and (ii) an employee retraining and development program, to facilitate redeployment of a portion of Diablo Canyon personnel to the decommissioning project and elsewhere in the Utility. There can be no assurance that the Utility will be successful in retaining highly skilled personnel under its employee programs. 
The Utility has incurred, and may continue to incur, substantial costs to comply with NRC regulations and orders. (See &#8220;Regulatory Environment&#8221; in Item 1. Business above.) If the Utility were unable to recover these costs, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected. The Utility may determine that it cannot comply with the new regulations or orders in a feasible and economic manner and voluntarily cease operations; alternatively, the NRC may order the Utility to cease operations until the Utility can comply with new regulations, orders, or decisions. The Utility may incur a material charge if it ceases operations at Diablo Canyon&#8217;s two nuclear generation units before their respective licenses expire in 2024 and 2025. At December 31, 2019, the Utility&#8217;s unrecovered investment in Diablo Canyon was $1.6 billion. 
The Utility also has an obligation to decommission its electricity generation facilities, including its nuclear facilities, as well as gas transmission system assets, at the end of their useful lives. (See Note 3: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - &#8220;Asset Retirement Obligations&#8221; of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement in Item 8.) The CPUC authorizes the Utility to recover its estimated costs to decommission its nuclear facilities through nuclear decommissioning charges that are collected from customers and held in nuclear decommissioning trusts to be used for the eventual decommissioning of each nuclear unit. If the Utility&#8217;s actual decommissioning costs, including the amounts held in the nuclear decommissioning trusts, exceed estimated costs, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
For certain critical technologies, products and services, the Utility relies on a limited number of suppliers and, in some cases, sole suppliers. In the event these suppliers are unable to perform, the Utility could experience delays and disruptions in its operations while it transitions to alternative plans or suppliers. 
The Utility relies on a limited number of sole source suppliers for certain of its technologies, products and services. Although the Utility has long-term agreements with such suppliers, if the suppliers are unable to deliver these technologies, products or services, the Utility could experience delays and disruptions while it implements alternative plans and makes arrangements with acceptable substitute suppliers. As a result, the Utility&#8217;s business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially affected. As an example, the Utility relies on Westinghouse Electric Company LLC (acquired in 2018 by Brookfield Business Partners L.P.) for its nuclear fuel assemblies, and Silver Spring Networks, Inc. and Aclara Technologies LLC as suppliers of proprietary SmartMeter&#8482; devices and software, and of managed services, utilized in its advanced metering system that collects electric and natural gas usage data from customers. If these suppliers encounter performance difficulties or are unable to supply these devices or maintain and update their software, or provide other services to maintain these systems, the Utility&#8217;s metering, billing, and electric network operations could be impacted and disrupted. 
The Utility may be required to incur substantial costs in order to obtain or renew licenses and permits needed to operate the Utility&#8217;s business and the Utility may be subject to fines and penalties for failure to comply or obtain license renewal. 
The Utility must comply with the terms of various governmental permits, authorizations, and licenses, including those issued by the FERC for the continued operation of the Utility&#8217;s hydroelectric generation facilities, and those issued by environmental and other federal, state and local governmental agencies. Many of the Utility&#8217;s capital investment projects, and some maintenance activities, often require the Utility to obtain land use, construction, environmental, or other governmental permits. These permits, authorizations, and licenses may be difficult to obtain on a timely basis, causing work delays. Further, existing permits and licenses could be revoked or modified by the agencies that granted them if facts develop that differ significantly from the facts assumed when they were issued. In addition, the Utility often seeks periodic renewal of a license or permit, such as a waste discharge permit or a FERC operating license for a hydroelectric generation facility. 
If a license or permit is not renewed for a particular facility and the Utility is required to cease operations at that facility, the Utility could incur an impairment charge or other costs. Before renewing a permit or license, the issuing agency may impose additional requirements that may increase the Utility&#8217;s compliance costs. In particular, in connection with a license renewal for one or more of the Utility&#8217;s hydroelectric generation facilities or assets, the FERC may impose new license conditions that could, among other things, require increased expenditures or result in reduced electricity output and/or capacity at the facility. 
In addition, local governments may attempt to assert jurisdiction over various utility operations by requiring permits or other approvals that the Utility has not been previously required to obtain. 
The Utility may incur penalties and sanctions for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of licenses and permits which could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. If the Utility cannot obtain, renew, or comply with necessary governmental permits, authorizations, licenses, ordinances, or other requirements, or if the Utility cannot recover the increase in associated compliance and other costs in a timely manner, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
Risks Related to Environmental Factors 
Severe weather conditions, extended drought and shifting climate patterns could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
Extreme weather, prior extended drought and shifting climate patterns have intensified the challenges associated with wildfire management in California. The Utility&#8217;s service territory encompasses some of the most densely forested areas in California and, as a consequence, is subject to higher risk from vegetation-related ignition events than other California IOUs. Further, environmental extremes, such as prior drought conditions followed by periods of wet weather, can drive additional vegetation growth (which can then fuel fires) and influence both the likelihood and severity of extraordinary wildfire events. In California, over the past five years, inconsistent and extreme precipitation, coupled with more hot days, have increased the wildfire risk and made wildfire outbreaks increasingly difficult to manage. In particular, the risk posed by wildfires has increased in the Utility&#8217;s service area as a result of a prior extended period of drought, bark beetle infestations in the California forest and wildfire fuel increases due to record rainfall following the drought, and strong wind events, among other environmental factors. Contributing factors other than environmental can include local land use policies and historical forestry management practices. The combined effects of extreme weather and climate change also impact this risk. For example, in 2017, there were nearly double the number of wildfires in California than the annual average, including five of the most devastating wildfires in California&#8217;s history. On January 19, 2018, the CPUC approved a statewide fire-threat map that shows that approximately half of the Utility&#8217;s service territory is facing &#8220;elevated&#8221; or &#8220;extreme&#8221; fire danger. Approximately 25,000 circuit miles of the Utility&#8217;s nearly 81,000 distribution overhead circuit miles and approximately 5,500 miles of the nearly 18,000 transmission overhead circuit miles are in such high-fire threat areas, significantly more in total than other California IOUs. 
Severe weather events and other natural disasters, including wildfires and other fires, storms, tornadoes, floods, heat waves, drought, earthquakes, tsunamis, rising sea levels, pandemics, solar events, electromagnetic events, or other natural disasters such as wildfires, could result in severe business disruptions, prolonged power outages, property damage, injuries or loss of life, significant decreases in revenues and earnings, and/or significant additional costs to PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility. Any such event could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. Any of such events also could lead to significant claims against the Utility. Further, these events could result in regulatory penalties and disallowances, particularly if the Utility encounters difficulties in restoring power to its customers on a timely basis or if the related losses are found to be the result of the Utility&#8217;s practices and/or the failure of electric and other equipment of the Utility. 
Further, the Utility has been studying the potential effects of climate change (increased temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, rising sea levels) on the Utility&#8217;s operations and is developing contingency plans to adapt to those events and conditions that the Utility believes are most significant. Scientists project that climate change will increase electricity demand due to more extreme, persistent and hot weather. As a result, the Utility&#8217;s hydroelectric generation could change and the Utility would need to consider managing or acquiring additional generation. If the Utility increases its reliance on conventional generation resources to replace hydroelectric generation and to meet increased customer demand, it may become more costly for the Utility to comply with GHG emissions limits. In addition, flooding caused by rising sea levels could damage the Utility&#8217;s facilities, including gas, generation, and electric transmission and distribution assets. The Utility could incur substantial costs to repair or replace facilities, restore service, or compensate customers and other third parties for damages or injuries. The Utility anticipates that the increased costs would be recovered through rates, but as rate pressures increase, the likelihood of disallowance or non-recovery may increase. 
Events or conditions caused by climate change could have a greater impact on the Utility&#8217;s operations than the Utility&#8217;s studies suggest and could result in lower revenues or increased expenses, or both. If the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility&#8217;s rates to reflect the impact of events or conditions caused by climate change, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
The Utility&#8217;s operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and changes in or liabilities under these laws could adversely affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results. 
The Utility&#8217;s operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws, regulations, and orders, relating to air quality, water quality and usage, remediation of hazardous wastes, and the protection and conservation of natural resources and wildlife. The Utility incurs significant capital, operating, and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental statutes, rules, and regulations. The Utility has been in the past, and may be in the future, required to pay for environmental remediation costs at sites where it is identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws. Although the Utility has recorded liabilities for known environmental obligations, these costs can be difficult to estimate due to uncertainties about the extent of contamination, remediation alternatives, the applicable remediation levels, and the financial ability of other potentially responsible parties. (For more information, see Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) 
Environmental remediation costs could increase in the future as a result of new legislation, the current trend toward more stringent standards, and stricter and more expansive application of existing environmental regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or failure to comply with the terms of licenses or permits issued by environmental or regulatory agencies, could expose the Utility to claims by third parties or the imposition of civil or criminal fines or other sanctions. 
The CPUC has authorized the Utility to recover its environmental remediation costs for certain sites through various ratemaking mechanisms. One of these mechanisms allows the Utility rate recovery for 90% of its hazardous substance remediation costs for certain approved sites without a reasonableness review. The CPUC may discontinue or change these ratemaking mechanisms in the future or the Utility may incur environmental costs that exceed amounts the CPUC has authorized the Utility to recover in rates. 
Some of the Utility&#8217;s environmental costs, such as the remediation costs associated with the Hinkley natural gas compressor site, are not recoverable through rates or insurance. (See &#8220;Environmental Regulation&#8221; in Item 1. and Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) The Utility&#8217;s costs to remediate groundwater contamination near the Hinkley natural gas compressor site and to abate the effects of the contamination have had, and may continue to have, a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results. Their financial results also can be materially affected by changes in estimated costs and by the extent to which actual remediation costs differ from recorded liabilities. 
State climate policy requires reductions in greenhouse gases of 40% by 2030 and 80% by 2050. Various proposals for addressing these reductions have the potential to reduce natural gas usage and increase natural gas costs, which may impact the future of natural gas services. The future recovery of the increased costs associated with compliance is uncertain. 
The CARB is the state&#8217;s primary regulator for GHG emission reduction programs. Natural gas providers have been subject to compliance with CARB&#8217;s Cap-and-Trade Program since 2015, and natural gas end-use customers have an increasing exposure to carbon costs under the Program through 2030 when the full cost will be reflected in customer bills. CARB&#8217;s Scoping Plan also proposes various methods of reducing GHG emissions from natural gas. These include more aggressive energy efficiency programs to reduce natural gas end use, increased renewable portfolio standards generation in the electric sector reducing noncore gas load, and replacement of natural gas appliances with electric appliances, leading to further reduced demand. These natural gas load reductions may be partially offset by CARB&#8217;s proposals to deploy natural gas to replace wood fuel in home heating and diesel in transportation applications. CARB also proposes a displacement of some conventional natural gas with above-market renewable natural gas. The combination of reduced load and increased costs could result in higher natural gas customer bills and a potential mandate to deliver renewable natural gas could lead to cost recovery risk. In addition, local city governments have passed ordinances restricting use of natural gas in new construction, and if other jurisdictions follow suit, this could affect future demand for the provision of natural gas. 
Other Risk Factors 
Poor investment performance or other factors could require PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility to make significant unplanned contributions to its pension plan, other postretirement benefits plans, and nuclear decommissioning trusts. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility provide defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits for eligible employees and retirees. The Utility also maintains three trusts for the purposes of providing funds to decommission its nuclear facilities. The performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of plan assets and trust assets. A decline in the market value may increase the funding requirements for these plans and trusts. The cost of providing pension and other postretirement benefits is also affected by other factors, including interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels, the rate of return on plan assets, employee demographics, discount rates used in determining future benefit obligations, rates of increase in health care costs, future government regulation, and prior contributions to the plans. Similarly, funding requirements for the nuclear decommissioning trusts are affected by the rates of return on trust assets, changes in the laws or regulations regarding nuclear decommissioning or decommissioning funding requirements as well as changes in assumptions or forecasts related to decommissioning dates, technology and the cost of labor, materials and equipment. (See Note 3: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) If the Utility is required to make significant unplanned contributions to fund the pension and postretirement plans or if actual nuclear decommissioning costs exceed the amount of nuclear decommissioning trust funds and the Utility is unable to recover the contributions or additional costs in rates, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
The Utility&#8217;s success depends on the availability of the services of a qualified workforce and its ability to maintain satisfactory collective bargaining agreements which cover a substantial number of employees. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s results may suffer if the Utility is unable to attract and retain qualified personnel and senior management talent, or if prolonged labor disruptions occur. 
The Utility&#8217;s workforce is aging and many employees are or will become eligible to retire within the next few years. Although the Utility has undertaken efforts to recruit and train new field service personnel, the Utility may be faced with a shortage of experienced and qualified personnel. The majority of the Utility&#8217;s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with three unions. Labor disruptions could occur depending on the outcome of negotiations to renew the terms of these agreements with the unions or if tentative new agreements are not ratified by their members. In addition, some of the remaining non-represented Utility employees could join one of these unions in the future. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility also may face challenges in attracting and retaining senior management talent especially if they are unable to restore the reputational harm generated by the negative publicity stemming from the ongoing enforcement proceedings and the Chapter 11 Cases. Any such occurrences could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The Utility&#8217;s business activities are concentrated in one region, as a result of which, its future performance may be affected by events and factors unique to California. 
The Utility&#8217;s business activities are concentrated in Northern California. As a result, the Utility&#8217;s future performance may be affected by events and economic factors unique to California or by regional regulation or legislation, including, for example, the doctrine of inverse condemnation. (See &#8220;The doctrine of inverse condemnation, if applied by courts in litigation to which PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are subject, could significantly expand the potential liabilities from such litigation and materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows&#8221; above.)

PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results can be affected by many factors, including estimates and assumptions used in the critical accounting policies described in MD&#38;A, that can cause their actual financial results to differ materially from historical results or from anticipated future financial results. The following discussion of key risk factors should be considered in evaluating an investment in PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility and should be read in conjunction with MD&#38;A and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this Form 10-K. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
Risks Related to Chapter 11 Proceedings and Liquidity 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 and are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with their bankruptcy cases. 
On the Petition Date, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 in the Bankruptcy Court. For the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases, the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility will be subject to various risks, including but not limited to the following: 
the ability to develop, consummate, and implement a plan of reorganization with respect to PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility during the Chapter 11 Cases; 
the ability to develop and obtain applicable Bankruptcy Court, creditor, and regulatory approval of a successful plan of reorganization and the effect of any alternative proposals, views, and objections of official committees, creditors, state and federal regulators, and other stakeholders, which may make it difficult to develop and consummate a successful plan of reorganization in a timely manner; 
the ability to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval with respect to motions in the Chapter 11 Cases and the outcomes of Bankruptcy Court rulings and of the Chapter 11 Cases in general; 
risks associated with third-party motions or adversary proceedings in the Chapter 11 Cases, which may interfere with business operations, including additional collateral requirements, or the ability to formulate and implement a plan of reorganization; 
increased costs related to the Chapter 11 Cases and related litigation; 
potential for an increase in general unsecured claims as a result of the rejection of any executory contracts or unexpired leases as permitted under the Bankruptcy Code; 
the ability to maintain or obtain sufficient financing sources for ongoing operations during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases or thereafter or to fund a plan of reorganization and meet future obligations, including commitments outlined in the Utility's 2020 GRC and other regulatory proceedings; 
the potential for a material decrease in the number of counterparties that are willing to engage in transactions, including commodity-related transactions, with PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility and a significant increase in the amount of collateral required to engage in any such transactions; 
the potential for a loss of, or a disruption in the materials or services received from, suppliers, contractors or service providers with whom the Utility has commercial relationships or adverse developments in the commercial and financial terms on which such providers engage in such relationships with PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility; 
risks associated with the potential that the Utility will not be able to comply with the capital structure requirements authorized by the CPUC, to the extent applicable, during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases or thereafter; 
potential increased difficulty in retaining and motivating key employees and potential increased difficulty in attracting new employees during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases and thereafter; 
the significant time and effort required to be spent by senior management in dealing with the Chapter 11 Cases and restructuring activities rather than focusing exclusively on business operations; and 
the ability to continue as a going concern. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility will also be subject to risks and uncertainties with respect to the actions and decisions of creditors and other third parties who have claims or interests in the Chapter 11 Cases that may be inconsistent with PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s plans. These risks and uncertainties could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows in various ways that cannot be predicted and may significantly increase the time PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have to operate in Chapter 11. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 Cases, it is not possible to predict or quantify the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 Cases may have on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows, nor is it possible to predict the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 Cases may have on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s corporate and capital structure. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility will be required to seek approvals of the Bankruptcy Court and certain regulators in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, and certain parties may object, intervene and protest approval, absent the imposition of terms or conditions to resolve their concerns. Such approvals may be denied, conditioned or delayed. 
Operating under Chapter 11 may restrict the ability of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility to pursue strategic and operational initiatives. 
Under Chapter 11, transactions outside the ordinary course of business are subject to the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court, which may limit PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to respond in a timely manner to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities or to adapt to changing market or industry conditions. These limitations include, among other things, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to: 
sell assets outside the normal course of business; 
make capital investments outside the normal course of business; 
consolidate or merge or sell or otherwise dispose of assets outside the normal course of business; 
grant liens; and 
finance operations, investments or other capital needs or engage in other business activities, including the ability to achieve California&#8217;s renewable energy goals. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility may experience increased levels of employee attrition as a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases. 
As a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility may experience increased levels of employee attrition, and their employees will likely face considerable distraction and uncertainty. A loss of key personnel or material erosion of employee morale could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to engage, motivate and retain key employees or take other measures intended to motivate and incentivize key employees to remain with PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility, as applicable, through the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is limited by restrictions on implementation of retention and incentive programs under the Bankruptcy Code. The loss of services of members of senior management could impair PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to execute their strategies and implement operational initiatives, which would likely have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
As a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s historical financial information may not be indicative of future financial performance. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s capital structure will likely be significantly altered under any plan of reorganization confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court. Under fresh-start accounting rules that may apply to PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility upon the effective date of a plan of reorganization, their assets and liabilities would be adjusted to fair value. Accordingly, if fresh-start accounting rules apply, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations following emergence from Chapter 11 would not be comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in their historical financial statements. In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases and the development of a plan of reorganization, it is also possible that additional restructuring and related charges may be identified and recorded in future periods. Such charges could be material to PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
If PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are not able to develop and consummate a consensual plan of reorganization, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by a protracted restructuring. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have commenced the Chapter 11 Cases without the benefit of a restructuring support agreement or agreed consensual plan of reorganization with any of its creditors or other key constituents. The Bankruptcy Code gives PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility the exclusive right to file a plan of reorganization for 120 days after the filing and, subject to extension for cause, up to a maximum of 18 months from the Petition Date, and prohibits creditors, equity security holders and others from proposing a plan of reorganization during this period. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have currently retained the exclusive right to file a plan of reorganization until at least May 29, 2019. If that right is terminated, however, or the exclusivity period is not extended or expires, there could be a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to achieve confirmation of a plan of reorganization that would enable PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility to reach their stated goals. 
Accordingly, no assurance can be provided as to the length of time during which the Chapter 11 Cases will be pending, whether a consensual or other plan of reorganization can be successfully developed and consummated, what the terms of any reorganization of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility may be, and what effect any such plan or reorganization would have on the capital structure (or any part thereof) of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility or on any of their respective equity, debt and other stakeholders, including as to matters of taxation and recovery or distributions upon consummation of any plan of reorganization. 
If PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are not able to develop and consummate a consensual plan of reorganization within the exclusivity period, one or more third parties may propose a competing plan of reorganization. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility may have limited ability to prevent an alternative plan of reorganization from being approved by the Bankruptcy Court, even if PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility do not believe such plan is in their best interest and the best interests of their stakeholders. Even if PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are successful in obtaining confirmation of a plan of reorganization following the expiration of their exclusivity period, the process may be lengthy, costly and disruptive. A contested plan of reorganization proceeding would likely have a more pronounced material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows than a consensual plan of reorganization. Even if PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are able to obtain requisite stakeholder approval, the Bankruptcy Court may not confirm a plan of reorganization. 
The uncertainty surrounding a prolonged restructuring would also have other material effects on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility including, but not limited to: 
the ability of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility to raise additional capital; 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s liquidity; 
how PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s business is viewed by regulators, investors, lenders and credit ratings agencies; 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s enterprise value; and 
PG&#38;E Corporation's and the Utility's ability to continue as a going concern. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility may be subject to claims that will not be discharged in their Chapter 11 Cases, which could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The Bankruptcy Code provides that the confirmation of a plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from substantially all claims arising prior to its filing under Chapter 11. With few exceptions, all claims that arose prior to PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s Chapter 11 Cases: (i) would be subject to compromise and/or treatment under the plan of reorganization and (ii) would be discharged in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and the terms of the plan of reorganization. Any claims not ultimately discharged through a plan of reorganization could be asserted against the reorganized entities and may have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows on a post-reorganization basis and may cast substantial doubt on PG&#38;E Corporation's and the Utility's ability to continue as a going concern. 
The DIP Facilities may be insufficient to fund PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s cash requirements through their emergence from bankruptcy. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s liquidity, including PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to meet their ongoing operational obligations, is dependent upon, among other things: (i) PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to comply with the terms and conditions of any post-petition financing and cash collateral order entered by the Bankruptcy Court in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, including the financing orders entered with respect to the DIP Credit Agreement, (ii) PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to maintain adequate cash on hand, (iii) PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to generate cash flow from operations, (iv) PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to develop, confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization or other alternative restructuring transaction and (v) the cost, duration and outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases. For the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility will be subject to various risks, including but not limited to (i) the inability to maintain or obtain sufficient financing sources for operations or to fund any plan of reorganization and meet future obligations, and (ii) increased legal and other professional costs associated with the Chapter 11 Cases and the reorganization. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have entered into the DIP Credit Agreement. As a result of the Bankruptcy Court&#8217;s interim approval of the DIP Credit Agreement on January 31, 2019 and the satisfaction of the other conditions thereof, the DIP Credit Agreement became effective on February 1, 2019, and a portion of the DIP Revolving Facility in the amount of $1.5 billion (including $750 million of the letter of credit subfacility) was made available to PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility. As of February 28, 2019, the remainder of the DIP Revolving Facility (including the remainder of the $1.5 billion letter of credit subfacility), the DIP Initial Term Loan Facility and the DIP Delayed Draw Term Loan Facility are unavailable for borrowing and will remain unavailable until and unless the Bankruptcy Court approves the availability thereof following a final hearing. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict the date of the final hearing, but it is currently scheduled for March 13, 2019. There can be no assurances that the Bankruptcy Court will grant final approval of the DIP Facilities at the final hearing, or at all. For more information on the DIP Credit Agreement, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 
The DIP Credit Agreement will mature on December 31, 2020, subject to the Utility&#8217;s option to extend the maturity to December 31, 2021 if certain terms and conditions are satisfied, including the payment of an extension fee. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility will face uncertainty regarding the adequacy of their liquidity and capital resources during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, and will have limited, if any, access to additional financing. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility cannot provide assurance that cash on hand, cash flow from operations, distributions received from their subsidiaries and borrowings available under the DIP Credit Agreement will be sufficient to continue to fund operations during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases. The ability of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility to maintain adequate liquidity depends in part upon industry conditions and general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond their control. In the event that cash on hand, cash flow from operations, distributions received from subsidiaries and availability under the DIP Credit Agreement are not sufficient to meet these liquidity needs, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility may be required to seek additional financing, and can provide no assurance that additional financing would be available or, if available, offered on acceptable terms. 
The DIP Credit Agreement imposes a number of restrictions on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility that may, among other things, limit their ability to conduct their business, or pursue new business opportunities and strategies. Additionally, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility may be unable to comply with the covenants imposed by the DIP Credit Agreement. Such non-compliance could result in an event of default under the DIP Credit Agreement that, if not cured or waived, could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. &#32; 
The DIP Credit Agreement imposes a number of restrictions on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility, including, among other things, affirmative covenants requiring PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility to provide financial information, cash flow forecasts, variance reports and other information to the administrative agent. The DIP Credit Agreement also contains general affirmative covenants such as compliance with all applicable laws, maintenance of licenses from necessary governmental authorities, maintenance of property and preservation of corporate existence. Negative covenants contained in the DIP Credit Agreement include restrictions on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, create liens on assets, make investments, loans or advances, engage in mergers, consolidations, sales of assets and acquisitions, pay dividends and distributions, and make payments in respect of junior or pre-petition indebtedness, in each case subject to customary exceptions. The Utility&#8217;s ability to borrow under the DIP Credit Agreement is subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions precedent set forth therein. For more information on the DIP Credit Agreement, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 
As a result of these covenants and restrictions, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility may be limited in their ability to conduct their business, and respond to changing business, market, and economic conditions. These provisions may also limit PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to pursue new business opportunities and strategies. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond their control and their failure to comply, or obtain a waiver in the event PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility cannot comply with a covenant, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing the DIP Credit Agreement that, if not cured or waived, could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility may not be able to obtain exit financing to, among other things, repay borrowings under the DIP Credit Agreement, and even if they are able to obtain such exit financing, the agreement governing such exit financing may significantly restrict PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financing and operational flexibility. The ability of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility to emerge from bankruptcy will likely depend on obtaining financings from a number of potential sources, and there can be no assurance that any such financings or other potential sources can be obtained expeditiously or on favorable terms, if at all. 
It is expected that the DIP Credit Agreement will be repaid using, in whole or in part, the proceeds from borrowings under exit financings. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to obtain such exit financing will depend on, among other things, the timing and outcome of various ongoing matters in the Chapter 11 Cases, their business, operations and financial condition, and market conditions. There can be no assurance that PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility will be able to obtain such exit financings on reasonable economic terms, or at all. If exit financing cannot be obtained, they may not be able to repay the DIP Credit Agreement at maturity or emerge from bankruptcy. Any exit financing that PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are able to obtain may include a number of significant restrictive or financial covenants which could impair their financial and operational flexibility and make it difficult to react to market conditions and satisfy their ongoing capital needs and unanticipated cash requirements. 
The ability of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility to emerge from bankruptcy will likely depend on proceeds received from a number of potential sources. These potential sources may include financings in the capital and credit markets, securitization, proceeds of asset sales or other dispositions, and other potential sources. The ability to execute on any such financings or other potential sources will be subject to a variety of factors, many of which will be beyond the control of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility, and may require consent or other action of federal and state regulators (including the FERC and the CPUC), the state legislature and executive branch, the Bankruptcy Court, other governmental entities, and other potential sources of third-party financing. There can be no assurance that any such financings or other potential sources can be obtained expeditiously or on favorable terms, if at all. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared assuming that PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility will continue as a going concern. &#32;&#32; PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are facing extraordinary challenges relating to a series of catastrophic wildfires that occurred in 2018 and 2017. Uncertainty regarding these matters raises substantial doubt about PG&#38;E Corporation's and the Utility's abilities to continue as going concerns. In addition, there is inherent uncertainty regarding the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases. &#32;&#32; PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have not included any financial statement adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements to this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared assuming that PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility will continue as a going concern. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are facing extraordinary challenges relating to a series of catastrophic wildfires that occurred in 2018 and 2017. Management has concluded that these circumstances raise substantial doubt about PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to continue as going concerns, and their independent registered public accountants have included an explanatory paragraph in their auditors&#8217; report which states certain conditions exist which raise substantial doubt about PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to continue as going concerns in relation to the foregoing. In addition, there is inherent uncertainty regarding the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases. For further discussion of such uncertainty, see the risk factors above in &#8220;Risks Related to Chapter 11 Proceedings and Liquidity&#8221; in this Item 1A. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s plans in regard to these matters are described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. See &#8220;Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm&#8221; in Item 8. 
Trading in PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s securities during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. 
Trading in PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s securities during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. The ultimate recovery, if any, by holders of PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s or the Utility&#8217;s securities in the Chapter 11 Cases could differ substantially from any value that may be implied by the trading prices of such securities at any particular time during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases. 
Risks Related to Wildfires 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by potential losses resulting from the impact of the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires, notwithstanding the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by potential losses resulting from the impact of the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires, notwithstanding the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases. As detailed below in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are subject to numerous lawsuits in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires by various plaintiffs, including wildfire victims, insurance carriers, and various government entities, under multiple theories of liability. These lawsuits generally assert that the Utility&#8217;s alleged failure to maintain and repair its distribution and transmission lines and failure to properly maintain the vegetation surrounding such lines were the causes of the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires. 
Due to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, these plaintiffs have been stayed from continuing to prosecute pending litigation and from commencing new lawsuits against PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility on account of pre-petition obligations. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s obligations with respect to such claims are expected to be determined through the Chapter 11 process. If the Utility&#8217;s facilities, such as its electric distribution and transmission lines, are determined to be the substantial cause of one or more fires, and the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies, the Utility could be liable for property damage, business interruption, interest, and attorneys&#8217; fees without having been found negligent, which liability, in the aggregate, could be substantial and have a material adverse effect on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility, including on PG&#38;E Corporation's and the Utility's ability to develop and consummate a successful plan of reorganization. (See &#8220;The doctrine of inverse condemnation, if applied by courts in litigation to which PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility are subject, could significantly expand the potential liabilities from such litigation and materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows&#8221; below.) In addition to such claims for property damage, business interruption, interest, and attorneys&#8217; fees, the Utility could be liable for fire suppression costs, evacuation costs, medical expenses, personal injury damages, punitive damages, and other damages under other theories of liability, including if the Utility were found to have been negligent, which liability, in the aggregate, could be substantial and have a material adverse effect on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility, including on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to develop and consummate a successful plan of reorganization. Among other things, it is uncertain at this time as to the number of wildfire-related claims that will be filed in the Chapter 11 Cases, the number of current and future claims that will be settled in a plan of reorganization, how claims for punitive damages and claims by variously situated persons will be treated and whether such claims will be allowed, and the impact that historical settlement values for wildfire claims may have on the estimation of wildfire liability in the Chapter 11 Cases. 
Further, the Utility could be subject to material fines or penalties if the CPUC or any law enforcement agency brought an enforcement action, including a criminal proceeding, and determined that the Utility failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Such actions would not be subject to the automatic stay. 
As described below in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, based on information made available by the California Department of Insurance, insurers have received an aggregate amount of approximately $18.4 billion of insurance claims made as of the dates noted below related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility expect that additional claims have been submitted and will continue to be submitted to insurers, particularly with respect to the 2018 Camp fire. These claims reflect insured property losses only. The $18.4 billion of insurance claims described below does not account for uninsured or underinsured property losses, interest, attorneys&#8217; fees, fire suppression and clean-up costs, evacuation costs, personal injury or wrongful death damages, medical expenses or other costs, such as potential punitive damages, fines or penalties, or damages for claims related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires that have not manifested yet (""future claims""), each of which could be significant and could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility. The scope of all claims related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires is not known at this time because of the applicable statutes of limitations under California law. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s obligations with respect to such claims are expected to be determined through the Chapter 11 process. 
If PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility were to be found liable for certain or all of the costs, expenses and other losses described above with respect to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires, the amount of such liability could exceed $30 billion, which amount does not include potential punitive damages, fines and penalties or damages related to future claims. In certain circumstances, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s liability could be substantially greater than such amount. As a result, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
Potential liabilities related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires depend on various factors, including but not limited to the cause of each fire, contributing causes of the fires (including alternative potential origins, weather and climate related issues), the number, size and type of structures damaged or destroyed, the contents of such structures and other personal property damage, the number and types of trees damaged or destroyed, attorneys&#8217; fees for claimants, the nature and extent of any personal injuries, including the loss of lives, the extent to which future claims arise, the amount of fire suppression and clean-up costs, other damages the Utility may be responsible for if found negligent, and the amount of any penalties or fines that may be imposed by governmental entities. There are a number of unknown facts and legal considerations that may impact the amount of any potential liability, including the total scope and nature of claims that may be asserted against PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility and the treatment of such claims in the Chapter 11 Cases. 
For more information about the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires, see &#8220;2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires&#8221; in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are the subject of lawsuits and could be the subject of additional investigations, citations, fines or enforcement actions in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are the subject of a number of lawsuits that have been filed against PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility in Sonoma, Napa and San Francisco Counties&#8217; Superior Courts in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires, several of which seek to be certified as class actions, asserting damages that include wrongful death, personal injury, property damage, evacuation costs, medical expenses, punitive damages, attorneys&#8217; fees, and other damages. Insurance carriers who have made payments to their insureds for property damage arising out of the 2017 Northern California wildfires have filed 48 subrogation complaints in the San Francisco County Superior Court as of January 28, 2019. These complaints allege, among other things, negligence, inverse condemnation, trespass and nuisance. The allegations are similar to the ones made by individual plaintiffs. Insurance carriers have filed 37 similar subrogation complaints with respect to the 2018 Camp fire in the Sacramento County Superior Court. Further, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have been named as defendants in securities class action litigation related to the 2017 Northern California wildfires and 2018 Camp fire. 
Due to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, these plaintiffs have been stayed from continuing to prosecute pending litigation and from commencing new lawsuits against PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility on account of pre-petition obligations. However, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility could be the subject of additional lawsuits on account of obligations arising after the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases or the Bankruptcy Court could lift the automatic stay with respect to such pre-petition obligations. Further, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility could be the subject of additional investigations, citations, fines or enforcement actions in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires. The wildfire litigation could take a number of years to be resolved through the Chapter 11 process because of the complexity of the matters, including the ongoing investigation into the causes of the fires and the growing number of parties and claims involved. The ultimate number and allowed amount of such claims are not presently known and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. 
If PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility were to be found liable for any punitive damages or subject to fines or penalties in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires, their financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
If PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility were to be found liable for any punitive damages or subject to fines or penalties, the amount of such punitive damages, fines and penalties could be significant and could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows, as well as PG&#38;E Corporation's and the Utility&#8217;s ability to develop and consummate a successful plan of reorganization. The Utility has received significant fines and penalties in connection with past incidents. For example, in 2015, the CPUC approved a decision that imposed penalties on the Utility totaling $1.6 billion in connection with natural gas explosion that occurred in the City of San Bruno on September 9, 2010 (the &#8220;San Bruno explosion&#8221;). These penalties represented nearly three times the underlying liability for the San Bruno explosion of approximately $558 million incurred for third-party claims, exclusive of shareholder derivative lawsuits and legal costs incurred. The amount of punitive damages, fines and penalties imposed on PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility could likewise be a significant amount in relation to the underlying liabilities with respect to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires. 
The amount of potential losses resulting from the impact of the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires is expected to greatly exceed the amount of PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s insurance coverage for wildfire events and securing liability insurance in future years is expected to be increasingly difficult and expensive, if available at all. 
The amount of potential losses resulting from the impact of the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires is expected to greatly exceed the amount of PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s insurance coverage for wildfire events. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have $842 million of insurance coverage for liabilities, including wildfire events, for the period from August 1, 2017 through July 31, 2018, subject to an initial self-insured retention of $10 million per occurrence and further retentions of approximately $40 million per occurrence. During the third quarter of 2018, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility renewed their liability insurance coverage for wildfire events in an aggregate amount of approximately $1.4 billion for the period from August 1, 2018 through July 31, 2019, comprised of $700 million for general liability (subject to an initial self-insured retention of $10 million per occurrence), and $700 million for property damages only, which property damage coverage includes an aggregate amount of approximately $200 million through the reinsurance market where a catastrophe bond was utilized. In addition, coverage limits within these wildfire insurance policies could result in further material self-insured costs in the event each fire were deemed to be a separate occurrence under the terms of the insurance policies. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility may not be able to recover the full amount of their insurance. If PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are unable to recover the full amount of their insurance, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. Even if PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility were to recover the full amount of their insurance, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility expect their losses in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires will greatly exceed their available insurance. 
In addition, it could take a number of years before the Utility&#8217;s final liability in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires is known and the Utility could apply for recovery of costs in excess of insurance. While the CPUC has authorized the Utility to track certain wildfire costs in its WEMA, the Utility will be required to submit a separate request with the CPUC in the future for recovery of those costs. The Utility may be unable to fully recover costs in excess of insurance through regulatory mechanisms and, even if such recovery is possible, it could take a number of years to resolve and a number of years to collect. 
If PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility were to be found liable for certain or all of the costs, expenses, and other losses described above with respect to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires, the amount of such liability could exceed $30 billion, which amount does not include potential punitive damages, fines and penalties or damages related to future claims. In certain circumstances, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s liability could be substantially greater than such amount. For further discussion of the potential magnitude of PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s liability, see &#8220;PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by potential losses resulting from the impact of the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires, notwithstanding the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases&#8221; and &#8220;PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are the subject of lawsuits and could be the subject of additional investigations, citations, fines or enforcement actions in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires&#8221; above. 
Accordingly, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility expect losses in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires will greatly exceed their available insurance. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility also expect to face increasing difficulty securing liability insurance in future years due to availability and to face significantly increased insurance costs. PG&#38;E Corporation's and the Utility's obligations with respect to such claims are expected to be determined through the Chapter 11 process. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by the ultimate amount of third-party liability of the Utility in connection with the 2015 Butte fire. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by the ultimate amount of third-party liability that the Utility incurs in connection with the 2015 Butte fire. As described below in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are subject to numerous lawsuits in connection with the 2015 Butte fire by various plaintiffs, including individual plaintiffs, insurance carriers, and various government entities, under multiple theories of liability. Plaintiffs also seek punitive damages. The number of individual claimants may still increase in the future through the Chapter 11 process. 
In connection with the 2015 Butte fire, the Utility may be liable for property damages, interest, and attorneys&#8217; fees without having been found negligent, through the doctrine of inverse condemnation. (See &#8220;The doctrine of inverse condemnation, if applied by courts in litigation to which PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility are subject, could significantly expand the potential liabilities from such litigation and materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows&#8221; below.) In addition, the Utility may be liable for fire suppression costs, personal injury damages, and other damages if the Utility were found to have been negligent. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s obligations with respect to such claims are expected to be determined through the Chapter 11 process. While the Utility believes it was not negligent, there can be no assurance that a court would agree with the Utility. 
The Utility currently believes that it is probable that it will incur a loss of $1.1 billion in connection with the 2015 Butte fire. While this amount includes the Utility&#8217;s assumptions about fire suppression costs (including its assessment of the Cal Fire loss), it does not include any portion of the estimated claim from the OES. The Utility still does not have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the probable loss it may have for that additional claim. A change in management&#8217;s estimates or assumptions could result in an adjustment that could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows, as well as PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to develop and consummate a successful plan of reorganization. (See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) 
If the Utility is unable to recover all or a significant portion of its excess costs in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2015 Butte fire through ratemaking mechanisms and in a timely manner, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
As of December 31, 2018, the Utility incurred substantial costs in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2015 Butte fire in excess of costs currently in rates, some of which currently are or are expected to be recorded in the future in its WEMA, CEMA and FHPMA accounts. 
There can be no assurance that the Utility will be allowed to recover costs recorded in those accounts in the future, even if a court decision were to determine that the Utility is liable as a result of the application of the doctrine of inverse condemnation. For example, while the CPUC previously approved WEMA tracking accounts for San Diego Gas &#38; Electric Company in 2010, in December 2017, the CPUC denied recovery of costs that San Diego Gas &#38; Electric Company stated it incurred as a result of the doctrine of inverse condemnation, holding that the inverse condemnation principles of strict liability are not relevant to the CPUC&#8217;s prudent manager standard. San Diego Gas &#38; Electric, the Utility, and Southern California Edison filed requests for rehearing of that decision. On July 12, 2018, the CPUC voted out a decision denying the requests for rehearing. On November 13, 2018, the California Court of Appeal denied San Diego Gas &#38; Electric&#8217;s petition for writ of review, and on January 30, 2019, the California Supreme Court denied San Diego Gas &#38; Electric&#8217;s petition for review. 
SB 901, signed into law on September 21, 2018, requires the CPUC to establish a customer harm threshold, directing the CPUC to limit certain disallowances in the aggregate, so that they do not exceed the maximum amount that the Utility can pay without harming ratepayers or materially impacting its ability to provide adequate and safe service (the &#8220;Customer Harm Threshold&#8221;). SB 901 also authorizes the CPUC to issue a financing order that permits recovery, through the issuance of recovery bonds (also referred to as &#8220;securitization&#8221;), of wildfire-related costs found to be just and reasonable by the CPUC and, only for the 2017 Northern California wildfires, any amounts in excess of the Customer Harm Threshold. SB 901 does not authorize securitization with respect to possible 2018 Camp fire costs, as the bill does not address fires that occurred in 2018. 
On January 10, 2019, the CPUC adopted an OIR, which establishes a process to develop criteria and a methodology to inform determinations of the Customer Harm Threshold in future applications under Section 451.2(a) of the Public Utilities Code for cost recovery of 2017 wildfire costs. In the OIR, the CPUC stated that &#8220;consistent with Section 451.2(a), the determination of what costs and expenses are just and reasonable must be made in the context of an application for the recovery of specific costs related to the 2017 wildfires.&#8221; Based on the CPUC&#8217;s interpretation of Section 451.2 as outlined in the OIR, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility believe that any securitization of costs relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires would not occur, if at all, until (a) the Utility has paid claims relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires, (b) the Utility has filed application for recovery of such costs, and (c) the CPUC makes a determination that such costs are just and reasonable or in excess of the Customer Harm Threshold. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility therefore do not expect the CPUC to permit the Utility to securitize costs relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires on an expedited or emergency basis. Based on the OIR, as well as prior experience and precedent, and unless the CPUC alters the position expressed in the OIR, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility believe it likely would take years to obtain authorization to securitize any amounts relating to the 2017 Northern California wildfires. 
On February 11, 2019, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility filed opening comments in response to the OIR in which they argued, among other things, the CPUC should (1) promptly set a Customer Harm Threshold, or at least define the methodology for setting the Customer Harm Threshold with sufficient specificity to enable PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility and potential investors to anticipate that amount; (2) determine the Customer Harm Threshold based on the capital needed to resolve claims arising from both the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires to be provided for in a plan of reorganization; (3) define how the Customer Harm Threshold will be applied to any future wildfires; and (4) establish the Customer Harm Threshold based on the amount of debt PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility can raise. Based on assumptions set forth in the comments, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility indicated that they could borrow up to approximately $3 billion to fund wildfire claims costs as part of a plan of reorganization. 
The inability to recover all or a significant portion of costs in excess of insurance through increases in rates and by collecting such rates in a timely manner could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected in the event of non-compliance with the terms of probation or in the event of modifications to the conditions of probation. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected in the event of non-compliance with the terms of probation or in the event of modifications to the conditions of probation. On January 26, 2017, following the federal criminal trial against the Utility in connection with the San Bruno explosion, in which the Utility was found guilty on six felony counts, the Utility was sentenced to, among other things, a five-year corporate probation period and oversight by a third-party monitor for a period of five years, with the ability to apply for early termination after three years. The probation includes a requirement that the Utility not commit any local, state, or federal crimes during the probation period. As part of the probation, the Utility has retained a third-party monitor at the Utility&#8217;s expense. The goal of the third-party monitor is to help ensure that the Utility takes reasonable and appropriate steps to maintain the safety of its gas and electric operations, and to maintain effective ethics, compliance and safety related incentive programs on a Utility-wide basis. 
In 2018 and 2019, the court overseeing the Utility&#8217;s probation, issued various orders related to the Utility&#8217;s probation. On November 27, 2018, the court issued an order requiring that the Utility, the United States Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Northern District of California and the third-party monitor provide written answers to a series of questions regarding the Utility&#8217;s compliance with the terms of its probation. On December 5, 2018, the court issued an order requesting that the Office of the California Attorney General advise the court of its view on &#8220;the extent to which, if at all, the reckless operation or maintenance of PG&#38;E power lines would constitute a crime under California law.&#8221; The response of the Utility was submitted on December 31, 2018. On January 3, 2019 and January 4, 2019, the court issued two new orders requesting further information regarding each of the eighteen October 2017 Northern California wildfires that Cal Fire has attributed to the Utility&#8217;s facilities, and the Utility submitted its responses on January 10, 2019. On January 9, 2019, the court ordered the Utility to appear in court on January 30, 2019, as a result of the court&#8217;s finding that &#8220;there is probable cause to believe there has been a violation of the conditions of supervision&#8221; with respect to reporting requirements related to the 2017 Honey fire. In addition, on January 9, 2019, the court issued an order proposing to add new conditions of probation and ordered the Utility to show cause by January 23, 2019, as to why the Utility&#8217;s conditions of probation should not be modified as proposed. The Utility's response was submitted on January 23, 2019. On January 30, 2019, the court found that the Utility had violated a condition of its probation with respect to reporting requirements related to the 2017 Honey fire. The court issued an order stating that a sentencing hearing on the probation violation will be set at a later date. For more information about the Utility&#8217;s probation and the court&#8217;s orders, see &#8220;U.S. District Court Matters and Probation"" in Item 3. Legal Proceedings and ""U.S. District Court Matters and Probation&#8221; in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Such proceedings are not subject to the automatic stay imposed as a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases. 
The Utility could incur material costs, not recoverable through rates, in the event of non-compliance with the terms of its probation and in connection with the monitorship (including but not limited to costs resulting from recommendations of the third-party monitor). The Utility could also incur material costs, not recoverable through rates, in the event of modifications to the conditions of its probation. 
The Utility&#8217;s conviction and the outcome of probation could harm the Utility&#8217;s relationships with customers, regulators, legislators, communities, business partners, or other constituencies and make it more difficult to recruit qualified personnel and senior management. Further, they could negatively affect the outcome of future ratemaking and regulatory proceedings, for example, by enabling parties to argue that the Utility should not be allowed to recover costs that the parties allege are somehow related to the criminal charges on which the Utility was found guilty. They could also result in increased regulatory or legislative scrutiny with respect to various aspects of how the Utility&#8217;s business is conducted or organized. (See &#8220;Enforcement and Litigation Matters&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A.) 
The doctrine of inverse condemnation, if applied by courts in litigation to which PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility are subject, could significantly expand the potential liabilities from such litigation and materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
California law includes a doctrine of inverse condemnation that is routinely invoked in California. Inverse condemnation imposes strict liability (including liability for attorneys&#8217; fees) for damages as a result of the design, construction and maintenance of utility facilities, including utilities&#8217; electric transmission lines. Courts have imposed liability under the doctrine of inverse condemnation in legal actions brought by property holders against utilities on the grounds that losses borne by the person whose property was damaged through a public use undertaking should be spread across the community that benefitted from such undertaking, and based on the assumption that utilities have the ability to recover these costs from their customers. Plaintiffs have asserted the doctrine of inverse condemnation in lawsuits related to the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2015 Butte fire, and it is possible that plaintiffs could be successful in convincing courts to apply this doctrine in these or other litigations. For example, on June 22, 2017, the Superior Court for the County of Sacramento found that the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies to the Utility with respect to the 2015 Butte fire. Although the Utility has filed a renewed motion for a legal determination of inverse condemnation liability, there can be no assurance that the Utility will be successful in its arguments that the doctrine of inverse condemnation does not apply in the 2015 Butte fire or other litigation against PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility. 
Furthermore, a court could determine that the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies even in the absence of an open CPUC proceeding for cost recovery, or before a potential cost recovery decision is issued by the CPUC. Although the imposition of liability is premised on the assumption that utilities have the ability to automatically recover these costs from their customers, there can be no guarantee that the CPUC would authorize cost recovery whether or not a previous court decision imposes liability on a utility under the doctrine of inverse condemnation. In December 2017, the CPUC denied recovery of costs that San Diego Gas &#38; Electric Company stated it incurred as a result of the doctrine of inverse condemnation, holding that the inverse condemnation principles of strict liability are not relevant to the CPUC&#8217;s prudent manager standard. That determination is being challenged by San Diego Gas &#38; Electric as well as by the Utility and Southern California Edison. 
If PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility were to be found liable for damage under the doctrine of inverse condemnation, but is unable to secure a cost recovery decision from the CPUC to pay for such costs through increases in rates or to collect such rates in a timely manner, the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility would be materially affected by potential losses resulting from the impact of the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires. (See &#8220;PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by potential losses resulting from the impact of the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires, notwithstanding the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases&#8221;, &#8220;PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are the subject of lawsuits and could be the subject of additional investigations, citations, fines or enforcement actions in connection with the 2018 Camp fire and 2017 Northern California wildfires&#8221; and &#8220;PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by the ultimate amount of third-party liability of the Utility in connection with the 2015 Butte fire&#8221; above.) 
Risks Related to the Outcome of Other Enforcement Matters, Investigations, and Regulatory Proceedings 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected as a result of legislative and regulatory developments. 
The Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected as a result of SB 901 adopted in 2018 by the California legislature. In December 2018, the CPUC opened an OIR in connection with SB 901 that will adopt criteria and a methodology for use by the CPUC in future applications for cost recovery of wildfire costs. Following SB 901, in applications for cost recovery in connection with the 2017 wildfires, the CPUC is expected to consider the Utility&#8217;s financial status and determine the maximum amount the Utility can pay without harming customers or materially impacting its ability to provide adequate and safe service, and ensure that the costs or expenses that are disallowed for recovery in rates assessed for the wildfires, in the aggregate, do not exceed that amount. The Utility is unable to predict the timing or outcome of such future determination by the CPUC and its impact on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
In addition, SB 901 requires utilities to submit annual wildfire mitigation plans for approval by the CPUC on a schedule to be established by the CPUC. SB 901 establishes factors to be considered by the CPUC when setting penalties for failure to substantially comply with the plan. The Utility is unable to predict the timing or outcome of the CPUC&#8217;s review of the wildfire mitigation plan, the results of the CPUC compliance review of wildfire mitigation plan implementation, or the timing or extent of cost recovery for wildfire mitigation plan activities. (See &#8220;Regulatory Matters - Other Regulatory Proceedings&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A.) 
Finally, SB 901 established a Commission on Catastrophic Wildfire Cost and Recovery to evaluate wildfire reforms, including inverse condemnation reform, a potential state wildfire insurance fund, and other wildfire mitigation measures. The recommendations of the CPUC and the response by the Governor and legislature to those recommendations could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. (See &#8220;Regulatory Matters - Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A.) 
The Utility is subject to extensive regulations and the risk of enforcement proceedings in connection with such regulations, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by the outcomes of the CPUC&#8217;s investigative enforcement proceedings against the Utility, other known enforcement matters, and other ongoing state and federal investigations and requests for information. The Utility could incur material costs and fines in connection with compliance with penalties from closed investigations or enforcement actions or in connection with future investigations, citations, audits, or enforcement actions. 
The Utility is subject to extensive regulations, including federal, state and local energy, environmental and other laws and regulations, and the risk of enforcement proceedings in connection with such regulations. The Utility could incur material charges, including fines and other penalties, in connection with the ex parte OII, safety culture OII, the locate and mark OII, and other matters that the CPUC&#8217;s SED may be investigating. The SED could launch investigations at any time on any issue it deems appropriate. Such proceedings are likely not subject to the automatic stay imposed as a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases; however, collection efforts in connection with fines or penalties arising out of such proceedings are stayed. 
The SED has discretion whether to issue a penalty for each violation, but if it assesses a penalty for a violation, it is required to impose the maximum statutory penalty of $50,000, with an administrative limit of $8 million per citation issued. For offenses occurred after January 1, 2019, the maximum statutory penalty is $100,000, as provided in SB 901. The SED may, at its discretion, impose penalties on a daily basis, or on less than a daily basis, for violations that continued for more than one day. While it is uncertain how the CPUC will calculate the number of violations or the penalty for any violations, such fines or penalties could be significant and materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s liquidity and results of operations. (See &#8220;Regulatory Environment&#8221; in Item 1. Business and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) 
The Utility also is a target of a number of investigations, in addition to certain investigations in connection with the wildfires. (See ""Risks Related to Wildfires,"" above.) In 2014, both the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco and the California Attorney General's office opened investigations into matters related to allegedly improper communication between the Utility and CPUC personnel. The Utility also is unable to predict the outcome of, or costs and expenses associate with, pending investigations, including whether any charges will be brought against the Utility. 
If these investigations result in enforcement action against the Utility, the Utility could incur additional fines or penalties the amount of which could be substantial and, in the event of a judgment against the Utility, suffer further ongoing negative consequences. Furthermore, a negative outcome in any of these investigations, or future enforcement actions, could negatively affect the outcome of future ratemaking and regulatory proceedings to which the Utility may be subject; for example, by enabling parties to challenge the Utility&#8217;s request to recover costs that the parties allege are somehow related to the Utility&#8217;s violations. (See also &#8220;PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected in the event of non-compliance with the terms of probation or in the event of modifications to the conditions of probation&#8221; above.) 
The Utility could be subject to additional regulatory or governmental enforcement action in the future with respect to compliance with federal, state or local laws, regulations or orders that could result in additional fines, penalties or customer refunds, including those regarding renewable energy and resource adequacy requirements; customer billing; customer service; affiliate transactions; vegetation management; design, construction, operating and maintenance practices; safety and inspection practices; compliance with CPUC general orders or other applicable CPUC decisions or regulations; federal electric reliability standards; and environmental compliance. CPUC staff could also impose penalties on the Utility in the future in accordance with its authority under the gas and electric safety citation programs. The amount of such fines, penalties, or customer refunds could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results primarily depend on the outcomes of regulatory and ratemaking proceedings and the Utility&#8217;s ability to manage its operating expenses and capital expenditures so that it is able to earn its authorized rate of return in a timely manner. 
As a regulated entity, the Utility&#8217;s rates are set by the CPUC or the FERC on a prospective basis and are generally designed to allow the Utility to collect sufficient revenues to recover reasonable costs of providing service, including a return on its capital investments. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected if the CPUC or the FERC does not authorize sufficient revenues for the Utility to safely and reliably serve its customers and earn its authorized ROE. The outcome of the Utility&#8217;s ratemaking proceedings can be affected by many factors, including the level of opposition by intervening parties; potential rate impacts; increasing levels of regulatory review; changes in the political, regulatory, or legislative environments; and the opinions of the Utility&#8217;s regulators, consumer and other stakeholder organizations, and customers, about the Utility&#8217;s ability to provide safe, reliable, and affordable electric and gas services. Further, the increasing amount of Reliability Must Run (&#8220;RMR&#8221;) electric generation in the CAISO could increase the Utility&#8217;s costs of procuring capacity needed for reliable service to its customers. 
In addition to the amount of authorized revenues, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected if the Utility&#8217;s actual costs to safely and reliably serve its customers differ from authorized or forecast costs. The Utility may incur additional costs for many reasons including changing market circumstances, unanticipated events (such as wildfires, storms, earthquakes, accidents, or catastrophic or other events affecting the Utility&#8217;s operations), or compliance with new state laws or policies. Although the Utility may be allowed to recover some or all of the additional costs, there may be a substantial time lag between when the Utility incurs the costs and when the Utility is authorized to collect revenues to recover such costs. Alternatively, the CPUC or the FERC may disallow costs that they determine were not reasonably or prudently incurred by the Utility. &#32; 
The Utility also is required to incur costs to comply with legislative and regulatory requirements and initiatives, such as those relating to the development of a state-wide electric vehicle charging infrastructure, the deployment of distributed energy resources, implementation of demand response and customer energy efficiency programs, energy storage and renewable energy targets, underground gas storage, and the construction of the California high-speed rail project. The Utility&#8217;s ability to recover costs, including its investments, associated with these and other legislative and regulatory initiatives will depend, in large part, on the final form of legislative or regulatory requirements, and whether the associated ratemaking mechanisms can be timely adjusted to reflect a lower customer demand for the Utility&#8217;s electricity and natural gas services. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results depend upon the Utility&#8217;s continuing ability to recover &#8220;pass-through&#8221; costs, including electricity and natural gas procurement costs, from customers in a timely manner. The CPUC may disallow procurement costs for a variety of reasons. In addition, the Utility&#8217;s ability to recover these costs could be affected by the loss of Utility customers and decreased new customer growth, if the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility&#8217;s rates to reflect such events. 
The Utility meets customer demand for electricity from a variety of sources, including electricity generated from the Utility&#8217;s own generation facilities, electricity provided by third parties under power purchase agreements, and purchases on the wholesale electricity market. The Utility must manage these sources using the commercial and CPUC regulatory principles of &#8220;least cost dispatch&#8221; and prudent administration of power purchase agreements in compliance with its CPUC-approved long-term procurement plan. The CPUC could disallow procurement costs incurred by the Utility if the CPUC determines that the Utility did not comply with these principles or if the Utility did not comply with its procurement plan. 
Further, the contractual prices for electricity under the Utility&#8217;s current or future power purchase agreements could become uneconomic in the future for a variety of reasons, including developments in alternative energy technology, increased self-generation by customers, an increase in distributed generation, and lower customer demand due to adverse economic conditions or the loss of the Utility&#8217;s customers to other retail providers. Despite the CPUC&#8217;s current approval of the contracts, the CPUC could disallow contract costs in the future if it determines that the terms of such contracts, including price, do not meet the CPUC reasonableness standard. 
The Utility&#8217;s ability to recover the costs it incurs in the wholesale electricity market may be affected by whether the CAISO wholesale electricity market continues to function effectively. Although market mechanisms are designed to limit excessive prices, these market mechanisms could fail, or the related systems and software on which the market mechanisms rely may not perform as intended which could result in excessive market prices. The CPUC could prohibit the Utility from passing through the higher costs of electricity to customers. 
Further, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be affected by the loss of Utility customers and decreasing bundled load that occurs through municipalization of the Utility&#8217;s facilities, an increase in the number of CCAs who provide electricity to their residents, and an increase in the number of consumers who become direct access customers of alternative generation providers. (See &#8220;Competition in the Electricity Industry&#8221; in Item 1.) As the number of bundled customers (i.e., those customers who receive electricity and distribution service from the Utility) declines, the rates for remaining customers could increase as the Utility would have a smaller customer base from which to recover certain procurement costs. Although the Utility is permitted to collect non-bypassable charges for above market generation-related costs incurred on behalf of former customers, the charges may not be sufficient for the Utility to fully recover these costs. In addition, the Utility&#8217;s ability to collect non-bypassable charges has been, and may continue to be, challenged by certain customer groups. Furthermore, if the former customers return to receiving electricity supply from the Utility, the Utility could incur costs to meet their electricity needs that it may not be able to timely recover through rates or that it may not be able to recover at all. 
In addition, increasing levels of self-generation of electricity by customers (primarily solar installations) and the use of customer NEM, which allows self-generating customers to receive bill credits for surplus power at the full retail rate, puts upward rate pressure on remaining customers, who may incur significantly higher bills due to an increase in customers seeking alternative energy providers. 
A confluence of technology-related cost declines and sustained federal or state subsidies could make a combination of distributed generation and energy storage a viable, cost-effective alternative to the Utility&#8217;s bundled electric service which could further threaten the Utility&#8217;s ability to recover its generation, transmission, and distribution investments. If the number of the Utility&#8217;s customers decreases or grows at a slower rate than anticipated, the Utility&#8217;s level of authorized capital investment could decline as well, leading to a slower growth in rate base and earnings. Reduced energy demand or significantly slowed growth in demand due to customer migration to other energy providers, adoption of energy efficient technology, conservation, increasing levels of distributed generation and self-generation, unless substantially offset through regulatory cost allocations, could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
Further, changes in commodity prices also may have an adverse effect on the Utility&#8217;s ability to timely recover its operating costs and earn its authorized ROE. Although the Utility generally recovers its electricity and natural gas procurement costs from customers as &#8220;pass-through&#8221; costs, a significant and sustained rise in commodity prices could create overall rate pressures that make it more difficult for the Utility to recover its costs that are not categorized as &#8220;pass-through&#8221; costs. To relieve some of this upward rate pressure, the CPUC could authorize lower revenues than the Utility requested or disallow full cost recovery. 
If the Utility is unable to recover a material portion of its procurement costs and/or if the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility&#8217;s rates to reflect the impact of changing loads, the wide deployment of distributed generation, and the development of new electricity generation and energy storage technologies, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
Risks Related to Operations and Information Technology 
The Utility&#8217;s electricity and natural gas operations are inherently hazardous and involve significant risks which, if they materialize, can materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The Utility owns and operates extensive electricity and natural gas facilities, including two nuclear generation units and an extensive hydroelectric generating system. (See &#8220;Electric Utility Operations&#8221; and &#8220;Natural Gas Utility Operations&#8221; in Item 1. Business above.) The Utility&#8217;s ability to earn its authorized ROE depends on its ability to efficiently maintain, operate, and protect its facilities, and provide electricity and natural gas services safely and reliably. The Utility undertakes substantial capital investment projects to construct, replace, and improve its electricity and natural gas facilities. In addition, the Utility is obligated to decommission its electricity generation facilities at the end of their useful operating lives, and the CPUC approved retirement of Diablo Canyon by 2024 and 2025. 
The Utility&#8217;s ability to safely and reliably operate, maintain, construct and decommission its facilities is subject to numerous risks, many of which are beyond the Utility&#8217;s control, including those that arise from: 
the breakdown or failure of equipment, electric transmission or distribution lines, or natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines, that can cause explosions, fires, or other catastrophic events; 
an overpressure event occurring on natural gas facilities due to equipment failure, incorrect operating procedures or failure to follow correct operating procedures, or welding or fabrication-related defects, that results in the failure of downstream transmission pipelines or distribution assets and uncontained natural gas flow; 
the failure to maintain adequate capacity to meet customer demand on the gas system that results in customer curtailments, controlled/uncontrolled gas outages, gas surges back into homes, serious personal injury or loss of life; 
a prolonged statewide electrical black-out that results in damage to the Utility&#8217;s equipment or damage to property owned by customers or other third parties; 
the failure to fully identify, evaluate, and control workplace hazards that result in serious injury or loss of life for employees or the public, environmental damage, or reputational damage; 
the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity, natural disaster, or terrorist act; 
the failure of a large dam or other major hydroelectric facility, or the failure of one or more levees that protect land on which the Utility&#8217;s assets are built; 
the failure to take expeditious or sufficient action to mitigate operating conditions, facilities, or equipment, that the Utility has identified, or reasonably should have identified, as unsafe, which failure then leads to a catastrophic event (such as a wild land fire or natural gas explosion); 
inadequate emergency preparedness plans and the failure to respond effectively to a catastrophic event that can lead to public or employee harm or extended outages; 
operator or other human error; 
an ineffective records management program that results in the failure to construct, operate and maintain a utility system safely and prudently; 
construction performed by third parties that damages the Utility&#8217;s underground or overhead facilities, including, for example, ground excavations or &#8220;dig-ins&#8221; that damage the Utility&#8217;s underground pipelines; 
the release of hazardous or toxic substances into the air, water, or soil, including, for example, gas leaks from natural gas storage facilities; flaking lead-based paint from the Utility&#8217;s facilities, and leaking or spilled insulating fluid from electrical equipment; and 
attacks by third parties, including cyber-attacks, acts of terrorism, vandalism, or war. 
The occurrence of any of these events could interrupt fuel supplies; affect demand for electricity or natural gas; cause unplanned outages or reduce generating output; damage the Utility&#8217;s assets or operations; damage the assets or operations of third parties on which the Utility relies; damage property owned by customers or others; and cause personal injury or death. As a result, the Utility could incur costs to purchase replacement power, to repair assets and restore service, and to compensate third parties. Any of such incidents also could lead to significant claims against the Utility. 
Further, although the Utility often enters into agreements for third-party contractors to perform work, such as patrolling and inspection of facilities or the construction or demolition or facilities, the Utility may retain liability for the quality and completion of the contractor&#8217;s work and can be subject to penalties or other enforcement action if the contractor violates applicable laws, rules, regulations, or orders. The Utility may also be subject to liability, penalties or other enforcement action as a result of personal injury or death caused by third-party contractor actions. 
Insurance, equipment warranties, or other contractual indemnification requirements may not be sufficient or effective to provide full or even partial recovery under all circumstances or against all hazards or liabilities to which the Utility may become subject. An uninsured loss could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The Utility&#8217;s insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover losses caused by an operating failure or catastrophic events, including severe weather events, or may not be available at a reasonable cost, or available at all. 
The Utility has experienced increased costs and difficulties in obtaining insurance coverage for wildfires that could arise from the Utility&#8217;s ordinary operations. PG&#38;E Corporation, the Utility or its contractors and customers could continue to experience coverage reductions and/or increased wildfire insurance costs in future years. No assurance can be given that future losses will not exceed the limits of the Utility&#8217;s insurance coverage. Uninsured losses and increases in the cost of insurance may not be recoverable in customer rates. A loss that is not fully insured or cannot be recovered in customer rates could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
As a result of the potential application to investor-owned utilities of a strict liability standard under the doctrine of inverse condemnation, recent losses recorded by insurance companies, the risk of increased wildfires including as a result of the ongoing drought, the 2018 Camp fire, the 2017 Northern California wildfires, and the 2015 Butte fire, the Utility may not be able to obtain sufficient insurance coverage in the future at a reasonable cost, or at all. In addition, the Utility is unable to predict whether it would be allowed to recover in rates the increased costs of insurance or the costs of any uninsured losses. 
If the amount of insurance is insufficient or otherwise unavailable, or if the Utility is unable to obtain insurance at a reasonable cost or recover in rates the costs of any uninsured losses, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
The electric power industry is undergoing significant change driven by technological advancements and a decarbonized economy, which could materially affect the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The electric power industry is undergoing transformative change driven by technological advancements enabling customer choice (for example, customer-owned generation and energy storage) and state climate policy supporting a decarbonized economy. The electric grid is a critical enabler of the adoption of new energy technologies that support California's climate change and GHG reduction objectives, which continue to be publicly supported by California policymakers. California's environmental policy objectives are accelerating the pace and scope of the industry change. For instance, SB 100, which was signed into law on September 10, 2018, increases from 50% to 60%, the percentage of California&#8217;s electricity portfolio that must come from renewables by 2030. SB 100 establishes a further goal to have an electric grid that is entirely powered by clean energy by 2045. California utilities also are experiencing increasing deployment by customers and third parties of DERs, such as on-site solar generation, energy storage, fuel cells, energy efficiency, and demand response technologies. These developments will require modernization of the electric distribution grid to, among other things, accommodate two-way flows of electricity, increase the grid's capacity, and interconnect DERs. 
In order to enable the California clean energy economy, sustained investments are required in grid modernization, renewable integration projects, energy efficiency programs, energy storage options, EV infrastructure and state infrastructure modernization (e.g. rail and water projects). 
To this end, the CPUC is conducting proceedings to: evaluate changes to the planning and operation of the electric distribution grid in order to prepare for higher penetration of DERs and, consider future grid modernization and grid reinforcement investments; evaluate if traditional grid investments can be deferred by DERs, and if feasible, what, if any, compensation to utilities would be appropriate for enabling those investments; and clarify the role of the electric distribution grid operator. The CPUC also authorized development of two new, five-year programs aimed at accelerating widespread electric vehicle adoption and combating climate change. The new programs will increase fast charging options for consumers as well as electric charging infrastructure for non-light-duty fleet vehicles. 
The industry change, costs associated with complying with new regulatory developments and initiatives and with technological advancements, or the Utility&#8217;s inability to successfully adapt to changes in the electric industry, could materially affect the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
A cyber incident, cyber security breach, severe natural event or physical attack on the Utility&#8217;s operational networks and information technology systems could have a material effect on its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The Utility&#8217;s electricity and natural gas systems rely on a complex, interconnected network of generation, transmission, distribution, control, and communication technologies, which can be damaged by natural events-such as severe weather or seismic events-and by malicious events, such as cyber and physical attacks. Private and public entities, such as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and U.S. Government Departments, including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Energy, and the White House, have noted that cyber-attacks targeting utility systems are increasing in sophistication, magnitude, and frequency. The Utility&#8217;s operational networks also may face new cyber security risks due to modernizing and interconnecting the existing infrastructure with new technologies and control systems. Any failure or decrease in the functionality of the Utility&#8217;s operational networks could cause harm to the public or employees, significantly disrupt operations, negatively impact the Utility&#8217;s ability to safely generate, transport, deliver and store energy and gas or otherwise operate in the most safe and efficient manner or at all, and damage the Utility&#8217;s assets or operations or those of third parties. 
The Utility also relies on complex information technology systems that allow it to create, collect, use, disclose, store and otherwise process sensitive information, including the Utility&#8217;s financial information, customer energy usage and billing information, and personal information regarding customers, employees and their dependents, contractors, and other individuals. In addition, the Utility often relies on third-party vendors to host, maintain, modify, and update its systems, and to provide other services to the Utility or the Utility&#8217;s customers. In addition, the Utility is increasingly being required to disclose large amounts of data (including customer energy usage and personal information regarding customers) to support changes to California&#8217;s electricity market related to grid modernization and customer choice. These third-party vendors could cease to exist, fail to establish adequate processes to protect the Utility&#8217;s systems and information, or experience security incidents or inadequate security measures. Any incidents or disruptions in the Utility&#8217;s information technology systems could impact the Utility&#8217;s ability to track or collect revenues and to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting. 
The Utility and its third-party vendors have been subject to, and will likely continue to be subject to, breaches and attempts to gain unauthorized access to the Utility&#8217;s information technology systems or confidential data (including information about customers and employees), or to disrupt the Utility&#8217;s operations. None of these breaches or attempts has individually or in the aggregate resulted in a security incident with a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. Despite implementation of security and control measures, there can be no assurance that the Utility will be able to prevent the unauthorized access to its operational networks, information technology systems or data, or the disruption of its operations. Such events could subject the Utility to significant expenses, claims by customers or third parties, government inquiries, penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, investigations, and regulatory actions that could result in material fines and penalties, loss of customers and harm to PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s reputation, any of which could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The Utility maintains cyber liability insurance that covers certain damages caused by cyber incidents. However, there is no guarantee that adequate insurance will continue to be available at rates the Utility believes are reasonable or that the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident will be covered by insurance or recoverable in rates. 
The operation and decommissioning of the Utility&#8217;s nuclear generation facilities expose it to potentially significant liabilities and the Utility may not be able to fully recover its costs if regulatory requirements change or the plant ceases operations before the licenses expire. 
The operation of the Utility&#8217;s nuclear generation facilities exposes it to potentially significant liabilities from environmental, health and financial risks, such as risks relating to the storage, handling and disposal of spent nuclear fuel, and the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity, natural disaster, or terrorist act. If the Utility incurs losses that are either not covered by insurance or exceed the amount of insurance available, such losses could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. In addition, the Utility may be required under federal law to pay up to $275 million of liabilities arising out of each nuclear incident occurring not only at the Utility&#8217;s Diablo Canyon facility but at any other nuclear power plant in the United States. 
On January 11, 2018, the CPUC approved the retirement of Diablo Canyon units by 2024 and 2025. However, the Utility continues to face public concern about the safety of nuclear generation and nuclear fuel. Some of these nuclear opposition groups regularly file petitions at the NRC and in other forums challenging the actions of the NRC and urging governmental entities to adopt laws or policies in opposition to nuclear power. Although an action in opposition may ultimately fail, regulatory proceedings may take longer to conclude and be more costly to complete. It is also possible that public pressure could grow leading to adverse changes in legislation, regulations, orders, or their interpretation. As a result, operations at the Utility&#8217;s two nuclear generation units at Diablo Canyon could cease before their respective licenses expire in 2024 and 2025. In such an instance, the Utility could be required to record a charge for the remaining amount of its unrecovered investment and such charge could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation's and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
In addition, in order to retain highly skilled personnel necessary to safely operate Diablo Canyon during the remaining years of operations, the Utility will incur costs in connection with (i) an employee retention program to ensure adequate staffing levels at Diablo Canyon, and (ii) an employee retraining and development program, to facilitate redeployment of a portion of Diablo Canyon personnel to the decommissioning project and elsewhere in the Utility. In its January 11, 2018 decision, the CPUC authorized rate recovery up to $211.3 million and in its November 29, 2018 decision, the CPUC authorized rate recovery up to $352.1 million as originally requested by the Utility for an employee retention program, but there can be no assurance that the Utility will be successful in retaining highly skilled personnel under such program. 
The Utility has incurred, and may continue to incur, substantial costs to comply with NRC regulations and orders. (See &#8220;Regulatory Environment&#8221; in Item 1. Business above.) If the Utility were unable to recover these costs, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected. The Utility may determine that it cannot comply with the new regulations or orders in a feasible and economic manner and voluntarily cease operations; alternatively, the NRC may order the Utility to cease operations until the Utility can comply with new regulations, orders, or decisions. The Utility may incur a material charge if it ceases operations at Diablo Canyon&#8217;s two nuclear generation units before their respective licenses expire in 2024 and 2025. At December 31, 2018, the Utility&#8217;s unrecovered investment in Diablo Canyon was $1.7 billion. 
The Utility also has an obligation to decommission its electricity generation facilities, including its nuclear facilities, as well as gas transmission system assets, at the end of their useful lives. (See Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - ""Asset Retirement Obligations"" of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement in Item 8.) The CPUC authorizes the Utility to recover its estimated costs to decommission its nuclear facilities through nuclear decommissioning charges that are collected from customers and held in nuclear decommissioning trusts to be used for the eventual decommissioning of each nuclear unit. If the Utility&#8217;s actual decommissioning costs, including the amounts held in the nuclear decommissioning trusts, exceed estimated costs, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
For certain critical technologies, products and services, the Utility relies on a limited number of suppliers and, in some cases, sole suppliers. In the event these suppliers are unable to perform, the Utility could experience delays and disruptions in its operations while it transitions to alternative plans or suppliers. 
The Utility relies on a limited number of sole source suppliers for certain of its technologies, products and services. Although the Utility has long-term agreements with such suppliers, if the suppliers are unable to deliver these technologies, products or services, the Utility could experience delays and disruptions while it implements alternative plans and makes arrangements with acceptable substitute suppliers. As a result, the Utility&#8217;s business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially affected. As an example, the Utility relies on Westinghouse Electric Company LLC (recently acquired by Brookfield Business Partners L.P.) for its nuclear fuel assemblies, and Silver Spring Networks, Inc. and Aclara Technologies LLC as suppliers of proprietary SmartMeter&#8482; devices and software, and of managed services, utilized in its advanced metering system that collects electric and natural gas usage data from customers. If these suppliers encounter performance difficulties or are unable to supply these devices or maintain and update their software, or provide other services to maintain these systems, the Utility&#8217;s metering, billing, and electric network operations could be impacted and disrupted. 
Risks Related to Environmental Factors 
Severe weather conditions, extended drought and shifting climate patterns could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
Extreme weather, extended drought and shifting climate patterns have intensified the challenges associated with wildfire management in California. The Utility's service territory encompasses some of the most densely forested areas in California and, as a consequence, is subject to higher risk from vegetation-related ignition events than other California IOUs. Further, environmental extremes, such as drought conditions followed by periods of wet weather, can drive additional vegetation growth (which can then fuel fires) and influence both the likelihood and severity of extraordinary wildfire events. In California, over the past five years, inconsistent and extreme precipitation, coupled with more hot days, have increased the wildfire risk and made wildfire outbreaks increasingly difficult to manage. In particular, the risk posed by wildfires has increased in the Utility&#8217;s service area as a result of an extended period of drought, bark beetle infestations in the California forest and wildfire fuel increases due to record rainfall following the drought, and strong wind events, among other environmental factors. Contributing factors other than environmental can include local land use policies and historical forestry management practices. The combined effects of extreme weather and climate change also impact this risk. For example, in 2017, there were nearly double the number of wildfires than the annual average, including five of the most devastating wildfires in California's history. On January 19, 2018, the CPUC approved a statewide fire-threat map that shows that approximately half of the Utility's service territory is facing ""elevated"" or ""extreme"" fire danger. Approximately 25,000 circuit miles of the Utility's nearly 81,000 distribution overhead circuit miles and approximately 5,500 miles of the nearly 18,000 transmission overhead circuit miles are in such high-fire threat areas, significantly more in total than other California IOUs. 
Severe weather events and other natural disasters, including wildfires and other fires, storms, tornadoes, floods, heat waves, drought, earthquakes, tsunamis, rising sea levels, pandemics, solar events, electromagnetic events, or other natural disasters such as wildfires, could result in severe business disruptions, prolonged power outages, property damage, injuries or loss of life, significant decreases in revenues and earnings, and/or significant additional costs to PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility. Any such event could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. Any of such events also could lead to significant claims against the Utility. Further, these events could result in regulatory penalties and disallowances, particularly if the Utility encounters difficulties in restoring power to its customers on a timely basis or if the related losses are found to be the result of the Utility&#8217;s practices and/or the failure of electric and other equipment of the Utility. 
Further, the Utility has been studying the potential effects of climate change (increased temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, rising sea levels) on the Utility&#8217;s operations and is developing contingency plans to adapt to those events and conditions that the Utility believes are most significant. Scientists project that climate change will increase electricity demand due to more extreme, persistent and hot weather. As a result, the Utility&#8217;s hydroelectric generation could change and the Utility would need to consider managing or acquiring additional generation. If the Utility increases its reliance on conventional generation resources to replace hydroelectric generation and to meet increased customer demand, it may become more costly for the Utility to comply with GHG emissions limits. In addition, flooding caused by rising sea levels could damage the Utility&#8217;s facilities, including gas, generation, and electric transmission and distribution assets. The Utility could incur substantial costs to repair or replace facilities, restore service, or compensate customers and other third parties for damages or injuries. The Utility anticipates that the increased costs would be recovered through rates, but as rate pressures increase, the likelihood of disallowance or non-recovery may increase. 
Events or conditions caused by climate change could have a greater impact on the Utility&#8217;s operations than the Utility&#8217;s studies suggest and could result in lower revenues or increased expenses, or both. If the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility&#8217;s rates to reflect the impact of events or conditions caused by climate change, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
The Utility&#8217;s operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and changes in or liabilities under these laws could adversely affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results. 
The Utility&#8217;s operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws, regulations, and orders, relating to air quality, water quality and usage, remediation of hazardous wastes, and the protection and conservation of natural resources and wildlife. The Utility incurs significant capital, operating, and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental statutes, rules, and regulations. The Utility has been in the past, and may be in the future, required to pay for environmental remediation costs at sites where it is identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws. Although the Utility has recorded liabilities for known environmental obligations, these costs can be difficult to estimate due to uncertainties about the extent of contamination, remediation alternatives, the applicable remediation levels, and the financial ability of other potentially responsible parties. (For more information, see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) 
Environmental remediation costs could increase in the future as a result of new legislation, the current trend toward more stringent standards, and stricter and more expansive application of existing environmental regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or failure to comply with the terms of licenses or permits issued by environmental or regulatory agencies, could expose the Utility to claims by third parties or the imposition of civil or criminal fines or other sanctions. 
The CPUC has authorized the Utility to recover its environmental remediation costs for certain sites through various ratemaking mechanisms. One of these mechanisms allows the Utility rate recovery for 90% of its hazardous substance remediation costs for certain approved sites without a reasonableness review. The CPUC may discontinue or change these ratemaking mechanisms in the future or the Utility may incur environmental costs that exceed amounts the CPUC has authorized the Utility to recover in rates. 
Some of the Utility&#8217;s environmental costs, such as the remediation costs associated with the Hinkley natural gas compressor site, are not recoverable through rates or insurance. (See &#8220;Environmental Regulation&#8221; in Item 1. and Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) The Utility&#8217;s costs to remediate groundwater contamination near the Hinkley natural gas compressor site and to abate the effects of the contamination have had, and may continue to have, a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results. Their financial results also can be materially affected by changes in estimated costs and by the extent to which actual remediation costs differ from recorded liabilities. 
State climate policy requires reductions in greenhouse gases of 40% by 2030 and 80% by 2050. Various proposals for addressing these reductions have the potential to reduce natural gas usage and increase natural gas costs. The future recovery of the increased costs associated with compliance is uncertain. 
The CARB is the state&#8217;s primary regulator for GHG emission reduction programs. Natural gas providers have been subject to compliance with CARB&#8217;s Cap-and-Trade Program since 2015, and natural gas end-use customers have an increasing exposure to carbon costs under the Program through 2030 when the full cost will be reflected in customer bills. CARB&#8217;s Scoping Plan also proposes various methods of reducing GHG emissions from natural gas. These include more aggressive energy efficiency programs to reduce natural gas end use, increased renewable portfolio standards generation in the electric sector reducing noncore gas load, and replacement of natural gas appliances with electric appliances, leading to further reduced demand. These natural gas load reductions may be partially offset by CARB&#8217;s proposals to deploy natural gas to replace wood fuel in home heating and diesel in transportation applications. CARB also proposes a displacement of some conventional natural gas with above-market renewable natural gas. The combination of reduced load and increased costs could result in higher natural gas customer bills and a potential mandate to deliver renewable natural gas could lead to cost recovery risk. 
Other Risk Factors 
The Utility may be required to incur substantial costs in order to obtain or renew licenses and permits needed to operate the Utility&#8217;s business and the Utility may be subject to fines and penalties for failure to comply or obtain license renewal. 
The Utility must comply with the terms of various governmental permits, authorizations, and licenses, including those issued by the FERC for the continued operation of the Utility&#8217;s hydroelectric generation facilities, and those issued by environmental and other federal, state and local governmental agencies. Many of the Utility&#8217;s capital investment projects, and some maintenance activities, often require the Utility to obtain land use, construction, environmental, or other governmental permits. These permits, authorizations, and licenses may be difficult to obtain on a timely basis, causing work delays. Further, existing permits and licenses could be revoked or modified by the agencies that granted them if facts develop that differ significantly from the facts assumed when they were issued. In addition, the Utility often seeks periodic renewal of a license or permit, such as a waste discharge permit or a FERC operating license for a hydroelectric generation facility. 
If a license or permit is not renewed for a particular facility and the Utility is required to cease operations at that facility, the Utility could incur an impairment charge or other costs. Before renewing a permit or license, the issuing agency may impose additional requirements that may increase the Utility&#8217;s compliance costs. In particular, in connection with a license renewal for one or more of the Utility&#8217;s hydroelectric generation facilities or assets, the FERC may impose new license conditions that could, among other things, require increased expenditures or result in reduced electricity output and/or capacity at the facility. 
In addition, local governments may attempt to assert jurisdiction over various utility operations by requiring permits or other approvals that the Utility has not been previously required to obtain. 
The Utility may incur penalties and sanctions for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of licenses and permits which could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. If the Utility cannot obtain, renew, or comply with necessary governmental permits, authorizations, licenses, ordinances, or other requirements, or if the Utility cannot recover the increase in associated compliance and other costs in a timely manner, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
Poor investment performance or other factors could require PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility to make significant unplanned contributions to its pension plan, other postretirement benefits plans, and nuclear decommissioning trusts. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility provide defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits for eligible employees and retirees. The Utility also maintains three trusts for the purposes of providing funds to decommission its nuclear facilities. The performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of plan assets and trust assets. A decline in the market value may increase the funding requirements for these plans and trusts. The cost of providing pension and other postretirement benefits is also affected by other factors, including interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels, the rate of return on plan assets, employee demographics, discount rates used in determining future benefit obligations, rates of increase in health care costs, future government regulation, and prior contributions to the plans. Similarly, funding requirements for the nuclear decommissioning trusts are affected by the rates of return on trust assets, changes in the laws or regulations regarding nuclear decommissioning or decommissioning funding requirements as well as changes in assumptions or forecasts related to decommissioning dates, technology and the cost of labor, materials and equipment. (See Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) If the Utility is required to make significant unplanned contributions to fund the pension and postretirement plans or if actual nuclear decommissioning costs exceed the amount of nuclear decommissioning trust funds and the Utility is unable to recover the contributions or additional costs in rates, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
The Utility&#8217;s success depends on the availability of the services of a qualified workforce and its ability to maintain satisfactory collective bargaining agreements which cover a substantial number of employees. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s results may suffer if the Utility is unable to attract and retain qualified personnel and senior management talent, or if prolonged labor disruptions occur. 
The Utility&#8217;s workforce is aging and many employees are or will become eligible to retire within the next few years. Although the Utility has undertaken efforts to recruit and train new field service personnel, the Utility may be faced with a shortage of experienced and qualified personnel. The majority of the Utility&#8217;s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with three unions. Labor disruptions could occur depending on the outcome of negotiations to renew the terms of these agreements with the unions or if tentative new agreements are not ratified by their members. In addition, some of the remaining non-represented Utility employees could join one of these unions in the future. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility also may face challenges in attracting and retaining senior management talent especially if they are unable to restore the reputational harm generated by the negative publicity stemming from the ongoing enforcement proceedings and the Chapter 11 Cases. Any such occurrences could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The Utility&#8217;s business activities are concentrated in one region, as a result of which, its future performance may be affected by events and factors unique to California. 
The Utility&#8217;s business activities are concentrated in Northern California. As a result, the Utility&#8217;s future performance may be affected by events and economic factors unique to California or by regional regulation or legislation, for example the doctrine of inverse condemnation. (See &#8220;The doctrine of inverse condemnation, if applied by courts in litigation to which PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are subject, could significantly expand the potential liabilities from such litigation and materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows&#8221; above.)

PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s an d the Utility&#8217;s financial results can be affected by many factors, including estimates and assumptions used in the critical accounting policies described in MD&#38;A, that can cause their actual financial results to differ materially from historical results or from anticipated future financial results. The following discussion of key risk factors should be considered in evaluating an investment in PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility and should be read in conjunction with MD&#38;A and the Consolidated Financial Statem ents and related N otes in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this Form 10-K. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of o perations, liquidity, cash flows, and stock price. 
Risks Related to Wildfires 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquid ity, and cash flows could be materially affected by potential losses resulting from the impact of the Northern California wildfires. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility also expect to be the subject of additional lawsuits and could be the subject of additiona l investigations, citations, fines or enforcement actions. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by potential losses resulting from the impact of the multip le wildfires that spread through Northern California, including Napa, Sonoma, Butte, Humboldt, Mendocino, Del Norte, Lake, Nevada, and Yuba Counties, as well as in the area surrounding Yuba City, beginning on October 8, 2017 (the &#8220;Northern California wildf ires&#8221;). According to the Cal Fire California Statewide Fire Summary dated October &#160; 30, 2017, at the peak of the wildfires, there were 21 major wildfires in California that, in total, burned over 245,000 acres, resulted in 43 fatalities, and destroyed an es timated 8,900 structures. Subsequently, the number of fatalities increased to 44. 
The Utility incurred $219 million in costs for service restoration and repair to the Utility&#8217;s facilities (including $97 million in capital expenditures) through December 3 1, 2017 in connection with these fires. While the Utility believes that such costs are recoverable through CEMA, its CEMA requests are subject to CPUC approval. The Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected if the Utility is unable to recover such costs. 
The fires are being investigated by Cal Fire and the CPUC, including the possible role of the Utility&#8217;s power lines and other facilities. The Utility expects that Cal Fire will issue a report or reports stating its conclusions as to the sources of ignition of the fires and the ways that they progressed. The CPUC&#8217;s SED also is conducting investigations to assess the compliance of electric and communication companies&#8217; facilities with appl icable rules and regulations in fire impacted areas. According to information made available by the CPUC, investigation topics include, but are not limited to, maintenance of facilities, vegetation management, and emergency preparedness and response. Var ious other entities, including fire departments, may also be investigating certain of the fires. (For example, on February 3, 2018, it was reported that investigators with the Santa Rosa Fire Department had completed their investigation of two small fires that reportedly destroyed two homes and damaged one outbuilding and had concluded that the Utility&#8217;s facilities, along with high wind and other factors, contributed to those fires.) It is uncertain when the investigations will be complete and whether Cal Fire will release any preliminary findings before its investigation is complete. 
As of January 31, 2018, the Utility had submitted 22 electric incident reports to the CPUC associated with the Northern California wildfires where Cal Fire has identified a site as potentially involving the Utility&#8217;s facilities in its investigation and the property damage associated with each incident exceeded $50,000. The information contained in these reports is factual and preliminary, and does not reflect a determinati on of the causes of the fires. The investigations into the fires are ongoing. 
If the Utility&#8217;s facilities, such as its electric distribution and transmission lines, are determined to be the cause of one or more fires, and the doctrine of inverse condemna tion applies, the Utility could be liable for property damage, interest, and attorneys&#8217; fees without having been found negligent, which liability, in the aggregate, could be substantial and have a material adverse effect on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility . (See &#8220;The doctrine of inverse condemnation, if applied by courts in litigation to which PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility are subject, could significantly expand the potential liabilities from such litigation and materially negatively affect PG&#38;E Corporat ion&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows&#8221; below.) In addition to such claims for property damage, interest and attorneys&#8217; fees, the Utility could be liable for fire suppression costs, evacuation costs, medical expe nses, personal injury damages, and other damages under other theories of liability, including if the Utility were found to have been negligent, which liability, in the aggregate, could be substantial and have a material adverse effect on PG&#38;E Corporation a nd the Utility. Further, the Utility could be subject to material fines or penalties if the CPUC or any other law enforcement agency brought an enforcement action and determined that the Utility failed to comply with applicable laws and regulations. 
Give n the preliminary stages of investigations and the uncertainty as to the causes of the fires, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility do not believe a loss is probable at this time. However, it is reasonably possible that facts could emerge through the course of the various investigations that lead PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility to believe that a loss is probable, resulting in an accrued liability in the future, the amount of which could be material. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility currently are unable to re asonably estimate the amount of losses (or range of amounts) that they could incur, given the preliminary stages of the investigations and the uncertainty regarding the extent and magnitude of potential damages. On January 31, 2018, the California Departm ent of Insurance issued a press release announcing an update on property losses in connection with the October and December wildfires in California, stating that, as of such date, &#8220;insurers have received nearly 45,000 insurance claims totaling more than $1 1.79 billion in losses,&#8221; of which approximately $10 billion relates to statewide claims from the October 2017 wildfires. The remaining amount relates to claims from the Southern California December 2017 wildfires. According to the California Department o f Insurance, as of the date of the press release, more than 21,000 homes, 3,200 businesses, and more than 6,100 vehicles, watercraft, farm vehicles, and other equipment were damaged or destroyed by the October 2017 wildfires. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Util ity have not independently verified these estimates. The California Department of Insurance did not state in its press release whether it intends to provide updated estimates of losses in the future. 
If the Utility&#8217;s facilities are determined to be the c ause of one or more of the Northern California wildfires, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility could be liable for the related property losses and other damages. The California Department of Insurance January 31, 2018 press release reflects insured property l osses only. The press release does not account for uninsured losses, interest, attorneys&#8217; fees, fire suppression costs, evacuation costs, medical expenses, personal injury and wrongful death damages or other costs. If the Utility were to be found liable f or certain or all of such other costs and expenses, the amount of PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s liability could be higher than the approximately $10 billion estimated in respect of the wildfires that occurred in October 2017, depending on the extent of the damage in connection with such fire or fires. As a result, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and t he Utility also are the subj ect of a still increasing number of lawsuits that have been filed against PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility in Sonoma, Napa and San Francisco Counties&#8217; Superior Courts, several of which seek to be certified as class actions. The lawsuits allege, among other things, negligence, inverse condemnation, trespass, and private nuisance. They principally assert that PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s alleged failure to maintain and repair their distribution and transmission lines and failure to properly maintain the vegetation surrounding such lines were the causes of the fires. The plaintiffs seek damages that include wrongful death, personal injury, property damage, evacuation costs, medical expenses, punitive damages, attorneys&#8217; fees, and other damages. In ad dition, two derivative lawsuits for breach of fiduciary duties and unjust enrichment were filed in the San Francisco County Superior Court on November 16, 2017 and November 20, 2017, respectively. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility expect to be the subject o f additional lawsuits in connection with the Northern California wildfires. The wildfire litigation could take a number of years to be resolved because of the complexity of the matters, including the ongoing investigation into the causes of the fires and the growing number of parties and claims involved. The Utility has liability insurance from various insurers, which provides coverage for third-party liability attributable to the Northern California wildfires in an aggregate amount of approximately $800 million. If the Utility were to be found liable for one or more fires, the Utility&#8217;s insurance could be insufficient to cover that liability, depending on the extent of the damage in connection with such fire or fires. 
In addition, it could take a number of years before the Utility&#8217;s final liability is known and the Utility could apply for cost recovery. The Utility may be unable to recover costs in excess of insurance through regulatory mechanisms and, even if such recovery is possible, it could take a number of years to resolve and a number of years thereafter to collect. Further, SB 819, introduced in the California Senate in January 2018, if it becomes law, would prohibit utilities from recovering costs in excess of insurance resulting from damages c aused by such utilities&#8217; facilities, if the CPUC determines that the utility did not reasonably construct, maintain, manage, control, or operate the facilities. PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have considered certain actions that might be taken to attemp t to address liquidity needs of the business in such circumstances, but the inability to recover costs in excess of insurance through increases in rates and by collecting such rates in a timely manner, or any negative assessment by the Utility of the likel ihood or timeliness of such recovery and collection, could have a material adverse effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. (See &#8220;If the Utility is unable to recover all or a sign ificant portion of its excess costs in connection with the Northern California wildfires and the Butte fire through ratemaking mechanisms, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be m aterially affected&#8221; below.) 
Losses in connection with the wildfires would likely require PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility to seek financing, which may not be available on terms acceptable to PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility, or at all, when required. (See &#8220;Risks Related to Liquidity and Capital Requirements&#8221; below.) 
As of December 31, 2017, neither PG&#38;E Corporation nor the Utility has accrued a liability with respect to the Northern California wildfires. If PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility were to determi ne that it is both probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, a liability would be recorded consistent with applicable accounting principles and as described in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial S tatements in Item 8. As noted above, to the extent that such determination is made and a liability is accrued with respect to the Northern California wildfires, the amount of such liability accrual may be substantial. To the extent not offset by insurance recoveries determined to be similarly probable and estimable, the liability would reduce the balance sheet equity of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility, which could adversely impact the Utility&#8217;s ability to maintain its CPUC-authorized capital structure of 5 2% equity and 48% debt and preferred stock, and which could also adversely impact PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s credit ratings and their ability to declare and pay dividends, efficiently raise capital, comply with financial covenants, and meet finan cial obligations. (See &#8220;PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results will be affected by their ability to continue accessing the capital markets and by the terms of debt and equity financings&#8221; below.) 
Uncertainties relating to and market percept ion of these matters and the disclosure of findings regarding these matters over time, also could continue or increase volatility in the market for PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s common stock and other securities, and for the securities of the Utility, and materially affect the price of such securities. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by the ultimate amount of third-party liability that the Utility incurs in connect ion with the Butte fire. 
In September 2015, a wildfire (known as the &#8220;Butte fire&#8221;) ignited and spread in Amador and Calaveras Counties in Northern California. &#160; On April 28, 2016, Cal Fire &#160; released its report of the investigation of the origin and cause of the wildfire. According to Cal Fire&#8217;s report, the fire burned 70,868 acres, resulted in two fatalities, destroyed 549 homes, 368 outbuildings and four commer cial properties, and damaged 44 structures. Cal Fire&#8217;s &#160; report concluded that the wildfire was caused when a gray pine tree contacted &#160; the Utility&#8217;s &#160; electric line which ignited portions of the tree, and determined that the failure by the Utility &#160; and/or its vegetation management contractors, ACRT Inc. and Trees, Inc., &#160; to identify certain potential hazards during its vegetation management program ultimately led to the failure of the tree. 
In connection with the Butte fire, complaints have been filed against t he Utility, currently involving approximately 3,770 individual plaintiffs representing approximately 2,030 households and their insurance companies. Plaintiffs seek to recover damages and other costs, principally based on the doctrine of inverse condemnati on and negligence theory of liability. Plaintiffs also seek punitive damages. The number of individual complaints and plaintiffs may still increase in the future , because the statute of limitations for property damages in connection with the Butte fire h as not yet expired. &#160; (The statute of limitations for personal injury in connection with the Butte fire has expired.) &#160; The Utility continues mediating and settling cases. 
In addition, on April 13, 2017, Cal Fire filed a complaint seeking to recover $87 milli on for its costs incurred in connection with the Butte fire , and in May 2017, the OES indicated that it intends to bring a claim against the Utility that the OES estimated in the approximate amount of $190 million. Also, in June 2017, the County of Calave ras indicated that it intends to bring a claim against the Utility that it estimates in the approximate amount of $85 million. 
In connection with th is matter, the Utility may be liable for property damages, interest, and attorneys&#8217; fees without having been found negligent, through the doctrine of inverse condemnation. In addition, the Utility may be liable for fire suppression costs, personal injury damages, and other damages if the Utility were found to have been negligent. While the Utility believes it was not negligent, there can be no assurance that a court or jury would agree with the Utility. 
The Utility currently believes that it is probabl e that it will incur a loss of at least $1.1 billion , increased from the $750 million previously estimated as of December 31, 2016 in connection with the Butte fire. W hile this amount includes the Utility&#8217;s assumptions about fire suppression costs (includ ing its assessment of the Cal Fire loss), it does not include any significant portion of the estimated claims from the OES and the County of Calaveras. The Utility still does not have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the probable loss it may have for these additional claims. &#160; A change in management&#8217;s estimates or assumptions could result in an adjustment that could have a material impact on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flo ws. &#160; (See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) 
If the Utility is unable to recover all or a significant portion of its e xcess costs in connection with the Northern California wildfires and the Butte Fire through ratemaking mechanis ms, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
Through December 31, 2017, the amounts accrued in connection with claims relating to the Butte fire have exceeded the Utility&#8217;s liability insurance coverage. While the Utility filed an application with the CPUC requesting approval to establish a WEMA to track wildfire expenses and to preserve the opportunity for the Utility to request recovery of wildfire costs that have not otherwise been recovered through insurance or other mechanisms, the Utility cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. (See &#8220; Regulatory Matters &#8211; Application &#160; to Establish a Wildfire Expense Memorandum Account&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A.) 
In addition, there can be no assurance that the Utility will be allowed to recover costs recorded in WEMA, if approved, in the future. While the CPUC previously approved WEMA tracking accounts for San Diego Gas &#38; Electric Company in 2010, in December 2017, the CPUC den ied recovery of costs that San Diego Gas &#38; Electric Company stated it incurred as a result of the doctrine of inverse condemnation, holding that the inverse condemnation principles of strict liability are not relevant to the CPUC&#8217;s prudent manager standard . That determination is being challenged by San Diego Gas &#38; Electric as well as by the Utility and Southern California Edison. 
Additionally, SB 819 introduced in the California Senate in January 2018, i f it becomes law, would prohibit utilities&#8217; recover y of costs in excess of insurance resulting from damages caused by such utilities&#8217; facilities, if the CPUC determines that the U tility did not reasonably construct, maintain, manage, control, or operate the facilities. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility hav e considered certain actions that might be taken to attempt to address liquidity needs of the business in such circumstances, but the inability to recover all or a significant portion of costs in excess of insurance through increases in rates and by collec ting such rates in a timely manner, or any negative assessment by the Utility of the likelihood or timeliness of such recovery and collection, could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The doctrine of inverse condemnation, if applied by courts in litigation to which PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility are subject, could significantly expand the potential liabilities from such litigation and materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation &#8217;s and the Utility &#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. 
California law includes a doctrine of inverse condemnation that is routinely invoked in California for wildfire damages. Inverse condemnation imposes strict liability (including liability for attorneys&#8217; fees) for damages as a result of the design, construction and maintenance of utility facilities, including utilities&#8217; electric transmission lines. Courts have imposed liability under the doctrine of inv erse condemnation in legal actions brought by property holders against utilities on the grounds that losses borne by the person whose property was damaged through a public use undertaking should be spread across the community that benefitted from such unde rtaking , and based on the assumption that utilities have the ability to recover these costs from their customers. Plaintiffs have asserted the doctrine of inverse condemnation in lawsuits related to the Northern California and Butte fires, and it is possib le that plaintiffs could be successful in convincing courts to apply this doctrine in these or other litigations. For example, o n June 22, 2017, the Superior Court for the County of Sacramento found that the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies to the Utility with respect to the Butte fire. Although the Utility has filed a renewed motion for a legal determination of inverse condemnation liability , there can be no assurance that the Utility will be successful in its arguments that the doctrine of invers e condemnation does not apply in the Butte fire or other litigation against PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility. 
Furthermore, a court could determine that the doctrine of inverse condemnation applies even in the absence of an open CPUC proceeding for cost recovery, or before a potential cost recovery decision is issued by the CPUC. Although the imposition of liability is premised on the assumption that utilities have the ability to automatically recover these costs from their customers, there can be no guar antee that the CPUC would authorize cost recovery whether or not a previous court decision imposes liability on a utility under the doctrine of inverse condemnation. I n December 2017, the CPUC denied recovery of costs that San Diego Gas &#38; Electric Company stated it incurred as a result of the doctrine of inverse condemnation, holding that the inverse condemnation principles of strict liability are not relevant to the CPUC&#8217;s prudent manager standard. That determination is being challenged by San Diego Gas &#38; Electric as well as by the Utility and Southern California Edison. 
I f PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility were to be found liable for damage under the doctrine of inverse condemnation, but is unable to secure a cost recovery decision from the CPUC to pay for such costs through increases in rates , the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility would be materially affected by potential losses resulting from the impact of the Northern California wildf ires. (See &#8220; PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility also expect to be the subject of additional lawsuits and could be the subject of additional investigations, citations, fines or enforcement actions&#8221; and &#8220;PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows could be materially affected by the ultimate amount of third-party liability that the Utility incurs in connection with the Butte fire&#8221; above.) 
Risks Related to the Outcome of Other Enforcement Matters, Inv estigations, and Regulatory Proceedings 
The Utility is subject to extensive regulations and the risk of enforcement proceedings in connection with such regulations, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected by the outcomes of the CPUC&#8217;s investigative enforcement proceedings against the Utility, other known enforcement matters, and other ongoing state and federal investigations and requests for information . The Utility could incur material costs and fines in connection with compliance with penalties from closed investigations or enforcement actions or in connection with future investigations, citations, audits, or enforcement actions. 
The Utility is subje ct to extensive regulations, including federal, state and local energy, environmental and other laws and regulations, and the risk of enforcement proceedings in connection with such regulations. The Utility could incur material charges, including fines an d other penalties, in connection with the ex parte OII, safety culture OII, and the CPUC&#8217;s SED investigations, including the SED&#8217;s investigations of the Yuba City incident, which arose from a residential structure fire in Yuba City, California, in January 2017, that resulted in the collapse of a house and injuries to two persons inside the house, or other current and future investigations. &#160; The SED could launch investigations at any time on any issue it deems appropriate. 
The SED has discretion whether to issue a penalty for each violation, but if it assesses a penalty for a violation, it is required to impose the maximum statutory penalty of $50,000, with an administrative limit of $8 million per citation issued. The SED may, at its discretion, impose pen alties on a daily basis, or on less than a daily basis, for violations that continued for more than one day. The SED also has wide discretion to determine the amount of penalties based on the totality of the circumstances, including such factors as the gr avity of the violations; the type of harm caused by the violations and the number of persons affected; and the good faith of the entity charged in attempting to achieve compliance, after notification of a violation. The SED also is required to consider th e appropriateness of the amount of the penalty to the size of the entity charged. Historically, the SED has exercised broad discretion in determining whether violations are continuing and the amount of penalties to be imposed. While it is uncertain how th e CPUC will calculate the number of violations or the penalty for any violations, such fines or penalties could be significant and materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s liquidity and results of operations. (See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) 
The Utility also is a target of a number of investigations. In 2014, both the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco and the California Attorney General's office opened investigations into matters related to allegedly improper communication between the Utility and CPUC personnel. The Utility also is unable to predict the outcome of, or costs and expenses associate with, pending investigations, including whether any charges will be brought against the Utility. 
If these investigations result in enforcement action against the Utility, the Utility could incur additional fines or penalt ies and, in the event of a judg ment against the Utility, suffer further ongoing negative consequences. For example, on April 9, 2015, the CP UC issued a decision in its investigative enforcement proceedings against the Utility to impose total penalties of $1.6 billion on the Utility after determining that the Utility had committed numerous violations of laws and regulations related to its natur al gas transmission operations (the &#8220;San Bruno Penalty Decision&#8221;). The San Bruno Penalty Decision requires the SED to review the Utility&#8217;s gas transmission operations (including the Utility&#8217;s compliance with the remedies ordered by the San Bruno Penalty De cision) and to perform annual audits of the Utility&#8217;s record-keeping practices for a minimum of ten years. The SED could impose fines on the Utility or require the Utility to incur unrecoverable costs, or both, based on the outcome of these future audits. &#160; Furthermore, a negative outcome in any of these investigations, or future enforcement actions, could negatively affect the outcome of future ratemaking and regulatory proceedings to which the Utility may be subject; for example, by enabling parties to ch allenge the Utility&#8217;s request to recover costs that the parties allege are somehow related to the Utility&#8217;s violations. (See also &#8220;PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s future financial results could be materially affected by the conviction of the Utility i n the federal criminal proceeding and by the debarment proceeding&#8221; below.) 
The Utility could be subject to additional regulatory or governmental enforcement action in the future with respect to compliance with federal, state or local laws, regulations or orders that could result in additional fines, penalties or customer refunds, including those regarding renewable energy and resource adequacy requirements; customer billing; customer service; affiliate transactions; vegetation management; design, construct ion, operating and maintenance practices; safety and inspection practices; compliance with CPUC general orders or other applicable CPUC decisions or regulations; federal electric reliability standards; and environmental compliance. For example, despite th e Utility&#8217;s system-wide survey of its transmission pipelines, carried out in an effort to address a self-reported violation whereby the Utility did not properly identify encroachments (such as building structures and vegetation overgrowth) on the Utility&#8217;s pipeline rights-of-way, the SED could impose fines on the Utility in the future based on the Utility&#8217;s failure to continuously survey its system and remove encroachments. CPUC staff could also impose penalties on the Utility in the future in accordance wi th its authority under the gas and electric safety citation programs. The amount of such fines, penalties, or customer refunds could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected in the event of non-compliance with the terms of probation and by the outcome of the debarment proceedin g. 
On August 9, 2016, the jury in the federal criminal trial against the Utility in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, in San Francisco, found the Utility guilty on one count of obstructing a federal agency proceedin g and five counts of violations of pipeline integrity management regulations of the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act. On January 26, 2017, the court issued a judgment of conviction against the Utility. The court sentenced the Utility to a five- year corpor ate probation period, oversight by a third-party monitor for a period of five years, with the ability to apply for early termination after three years , a fine of $3 million to be paid to the federal government, certain advertising requirements, and communi ty service. 
The probation includes a requirement that the Utility not commit any local, state, or federal crimes during the probation period. As part of the probation, the Utility has retained a third-party monitor at the Utility&#8217;s expense. The goal of the monitor is to help ensure that the Utility takes reasonable and appropriate steps to maintain the safety of its gas and electric operations, and to maintain effective ethics, compliance and safety related incentive programs on a Utility-wide basis. 
The Utility could incur material costs and additional penalties , not recoverable through rates, in the event of non-compliance with the terms of its probation and in connection with the monitorship (including but not limited to costs resulting from recomme ndations of the monitor). 
Since 2015, the Utility has also been the subject of a DOI inquiry into whether the Utility should be suspended or debarred from entering into federal procurement and non-procurement contracts and programs , citing the San Bruno e xplosion , and indicating, as the basis for the inquiry, alleged poor record-keeping, poor identification and evaluation of threats to gas lines and obstruction of the NTSB&#8217;s investigation. On December 21, 2016, the Utility and the DOI entered into an inter im administrative agreement that reflects the DOI&#8217;s determination that the Utility remains eligible to contract with federal government agencies while the DOI determines whether any further action is necessary to protect the federal government&#8217;s business i nterests. If the DOI determines that the Utility&#8217;s compliance and ethics program is not generally effective in preventing and detecting criminal conduct, the Utility may be required to enter into an amended administrative agreement and implement remedial a nd other measures, such as a requirement that the Utility&#8217;s natural gas operations and/or compliance and eth ics programs be supervised by one or more independent third- party monitor (s) . 
The Utility&#8217;s conviction and the outcome of probation and the debarme nt proceeding could harm the Utility&#8217;s relationships with regulators, legislators, communities, business partners, or other constituencies and make it more difficult to recruit qualified personnel and senior management. &#160; Further, they could negatively affe ct the outcome of future ratemaking and regulatory proceedings, for example, by enabling parties to argue that the Utility should not be allowed to recover costs that the parties allege are somehow related to the criminal charges on which the Utility was f ound guilty. They could also result in increased regulatory or legislative scrutiny with respect to various aspects of how the Utility&#8217;s business is conducted or organized. (See &#8220;Enforcement and Litigation Matters &#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A.) 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results primarily depend on the outcomes of regulatory and ratemaking proceedings and the Utility&#8217;s ability to manage its operating expenses and capital expenditures so that it is able to earn its authorized rate of return in a timely manner. 
As a regulated entity, the Utility&#8217;s rates are set by the CPUC or the FERC on a prospective basis and are generally designed to allow the Utility to collect sufficient revenues to recover reasonable costs of providing service, including a return on its capital investments. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected if the CPUC or the FERC does not authorize sufficient revenues for the Utility to safely and reliably serve its customers and earn its authorized ROE. The outcome of the Utility&#8217;s ratemaking proceedings can be affected by many factors, including the level of opposition by intervening parties; potential rate impacts; increasing levels of regulatory review; changes in the political, regula tory, or legislative environments; and the opinions of the Utility&#8217;s regulators, consumer and other stakeholder organizations, and customers, about the Utility&#8217;s ability to provide safe, reliable, and affordable electric and gas services. &#160; Further, the inc reasing amount of Reliability Must Run ( &#8220; RMR &#8221; ) electric generation in the CAISO could increase the Utility&#8217;s costs of procuring capacity needed for reliable service to its customers . 
In addition to the amount of authorized revenues, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s an d the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected if the Utility&#8217;s actual costs to safely and reliably serve its customers differ from authorized or forecast costs. The Utility may incur additional costs for many reasons including changing ma rket circumstances, unanticipated events (such as storms, fires, accidents, or catastrophic or other events affecting the Utility&#8217;s operations), or compliance with new state laws or policies. Although the Utility may be allowed to recover some or all of t he additional costs, there may be a substantial time lag between when the Utility incurs the costs and when the Utility is authorized to collect revenues to recover such costs. Alternatively, the CPUC or the FERC may disallow costs that they determine wer e not reasonably or prudently incurred by the Utility. 
The Utility also &#160; is required to incur costs to comply with legislative and regulatory requirements and initiatives, such as those relating to the development of a state-wide electric vehicle charging infrastructure, the deployment of distributed energy resources, implementation of demand response and customer energy efficiency programs, energy storage and renewable energy targets, underground gas storage, and the construction of the California high-sp eed rail project. The Utility&#8217;s ability to recover costs, including its investments, associated with these and other legislative and regulatory initiatives will, in large part, depend on the final form of legislative or regulatory requirements, and whethe r the associated ratemaking mechanisms can be timely adjusted to reflect a lower customer demand for the Utility&#8217;s electricity and natural gas services . &#160; 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results depend upon the Utility&#8217;s continuing ability t o recover &#8220;pass-through&#8221; costs, including electricity and natural gas procurement costs, from customers in a timely manner. The CPUC may disallow procurement costs for a variety of reasons. In addition, the Utility&#8217;s ability to recover these costs could be affected by the loss of Utility customers and decreased new customer growth , if the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility&#8217;s rates to reflect such events. 
The Utility meets customer demand for electricity from a variety of sources, including electricity gen erated from the Utility&#8217;s own generation facilities, electricity provided by third parties under power purchase agreements, and purchases on the wholesale electricity market. &#160; The Utility must manage these sources using the commercial and CPUC regulatory p rinciples of &#8220;least cost dispatch&#8221; and prudent administration of power purchase agreements in compliance with its CPUC-approved long-term procurement plan. The CPUC could disallow procurement costs incurred by the Utility if the CPUC determines that the U tility did not comply with these principles or if the Utility did not comply with its procurement plan. 
Further, the contractual prices for electricity under the Utility&#8217;s current or future power purchase agreements could become uneconomic in the future for a variety of reasons, including developments in alternative energy technology, increased self-generation by customers, an increase in distributed generation, and lower customer demand due to adverse economic conditions or the loss of the Utility&#8217;s cus tomers to other retail providers. &#160; In particular, the Utility will incur additional costs to procure renewable energy to meet the higher targets established by California SB 350 that became effective on January 1, 2016. Despite the CPUC&#8217;s current approval of the contracts, the CPUC could disallow contract costs in the future if it determines that the terms of such contracts, including price, do not meet the CPUC reasonableness standard. 
The Utility&#8217;s ability to recover the costs it incurs in the wholesa le electricity market may be affected by whether the CAISO wholesale electricity market continues to function effectively. Although market mechanisms are designed to limit excessive prices, these market mechanisms could fail, or the related systems and so ftware on which the market mechanisms rely may not perform as intended which could result in excessive market prices. &#160; The CPUC could prohibit the Utility from passing through the higher costs of electricity to customers. For example, during the 2000 and 2001 energy crisis, the market mechanism flaws in California&#8217;s then-newly established wholesale electricity market led to dramatically high market prices for electricity that the Utility was unable to recover through customer rates, ultimately causing the Utility to file a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
Further, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be affected by the loss of Utility customers and decreasing bundled load that occurs through municipalization of the Utility&#8217;s facilities, an increase in the number of CCAs who provide electricity to their residents, and an increase in the number of consumers who become direct access customers of alternative generation providers. (See &#8220;Competitio n in the Electricity Industry&#8221; in Item 1.) As the number of bundled customers (i.e., those customers who receive electricity and distribution service from the Utility) declines, the rates for remaining customers could increase as the Utility would have a smaller customer base from which to recover certain procurement costs. Although the Utility is permitted to collect non-bypassable charges for above market generation-related costs incurred on behalf of former customers, the charges may not be sufficient for the Utility to fully recover these costs. In addition, the Utility&#8217;s ability to collect non-bypassable charges has been, and may continue to be, challenged by certain customer groups. Furthermore, if the former customers return to receiving electrici ty supply from the Utility, the Utility could incur costs to meet their electricity needs that it may not be able to timely recover through rates or that it may not be able to recover at all. 
In addition, increasing levels of self-generation of electricity by customers (primarily solar installations) and the use of customer NEM, which allows self-generating customers to receive bill credits for surplus power at the full retail rate, puts upward rate pressure on remaining customers. New rules and rates became effective for new NEM customers of the Utility in December 2016. New NEM customers are required to pay an interconnection fee, comply with time of use rates, and are required to pay certain non-bypassable charges to help fund some of the cos ts of low income, energy efficiency, and other programs that other customers pay. Remaining customers may incur significantly higher bills due to an increase in customers seeking alternative energy providers . &#160; The CPUC has indicated that it intends to revi sit these rules in 2019. 
A confluence of technology-related cost declines and sustained federal or state subsidies could make a combination of distributed generation and energy storage a viable, cost-effective alternative to the Utility&#8217;s bundled electric service which could further threaten the Utility&#8217;s ability to recover its generation, transmission, and distribution investments. If the number of the Utility&#8217;s customers decreases or grows at a slower rate than anticipated, the Utility&#8217;s level of author ized capital investment could decline as well, leading to a slower growth in rate base and earnings. Reduced energy demand or significantly slowed growth in demand due to customer migration to other energy providers, adoption of energy efficient technolog y, conservation, increasing levels of distributed generation and self-generation, unless substantially offset through regulatory cost allocations, could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operat ions, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The CPUC has begun to implement rate reform to allow residential electric rates to more closely reflect the utilities&#8217; actual costs of providing service and decrease cross -subsidization among customer classes. Many aspe cts of rate reform are not yet finalized, including time-of-use rates and whether the utilities can impose a fixed charge on certain customers. 
Further, c hanges in commodity prices also may have an adverse effect on the Utility&#8217;s ability to timely recov er its operating costs and earn its authorized ROE. &#160; Although the Utility generally recovers its electricity and natural gas procurement costs from customers as &#8220;pass-through&#8221; costs, a significant and sustained rise in commodity prices could create overall rate pressures that make it more difficult for the Utility to recover its costs that are not categorized as &#8220;pass-through&#8221; costs. &#160; To relieve some of this upward rate pressure, the CPUC could authorize lower revenues than the Utility requested or disallow full cost recovery. 
If the Utility is unable to recover a material portion of its procurement costs and/or if the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility&#8217;s rates to reflect the impact of changing loads, the wide deployment of distributed generation, and the d evelopment of new electricity generation and energy storage technologies, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected . 
Risks Related to Liquidity and Capital Re quirements 
The outcome or market perception of the investigations and litigation in connection with the Northern California wildfires, and the outcome or market perception of other litigation and enforcement matters, could reduce or eliminate PG&#38;E Corpora tion&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s access to the capital markets and other sources of financing, which could have a material adverse effect on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s liquidity is dependent on many factors, including a ccess to the capital markets and availability under their revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program s . PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to access the capital markets, t he ability t o borrow under their loan financing arrangements, including their revolving credit facilities, and the terms and rates of future financings, as well as the credit ratings of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility and their respective debt facilities, could be materially affected by the outcome or market percep tion of the matters discussed in this 2017 Form 10-K under &#8220;Northern California Wildfires&#8221; in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 . Liabilities that could be incurred as a result of the Northern California wildfires could adversely affect their ability to comply with the covenants in their financing arrangements, which could adversely affect the ability to borrow under the applicable facility or program. 
Access by PG&#38;E Corporation to the equity capital markets is also critical to maintaining the Utility&#8217;s CPUC-authorized capital structure. PG&#38;E Corporation contributes equity to t he Utility as needed to maintain the Utility&#8217;s CPUC-author ized capital structure. &#160; In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, PG&#38;E Corporation issued $ 416 million in common stock and made equity contributions of $ 455 million to the Utility . &#160; PG&#38;E Corporatio n forecasts it will need a material am ount of equity in future years, including to support the Utility&#8217;s capital expenditures. &#160; PG&#38;E Corporation may also seek to issue additional equity to fund unrecoverable operating expenses and to pay claims, losses, fin es and penalties that may be &#160; required by the outcome of enforcement matters and litigation, including in connection with the Northern California wildfires, and the outcome of the related CPUC and Cal Fire investigations. 
If either PG&#38;E Corporation or the Utility is unable to access the capital markets or to borrow under their respective loan financing arrangements or commercial paper program s , PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows, could be materially affected. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to meet their debt service and other financial obligations and their ability to pay dividends depend on the Utility&#8217;s earnings and cash flows. In addition, in December 2017, the Boards of Directors suspended dividends on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s common stock and the Utility&#8217;s preferred stock, as a result of which the price of PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s common stock and the ability of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility to raise equity capital could be ad versely affected. 
PG&#38;E Corporation is a holding company with no revenue generating operations of its own. &#160; The Utility must use its resources to satisfy its own obligations, including the Utility&#8217;s obligation to serve customers, to pay principal and interest on outstanding debt, to pay preferred stock dividends , unless suspended, and meet its obligations to employees and creditors, before it can distribute cash to PG&#38;E Corporation . Under the CPUC&#8217;s rules applicable to utility holding companies, the Utility&#8217;s dividend policy must be established by the Utility&#8217;s Board of Directors as though the Utility were a stand-alone utility company and PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s Board of Directors must give &#8220;first priority&#8221; to the Utility&#8217;s capital requirements, as determined to be necessary and prudent to meet the Utility&#8217;s obligation to serve or to operate the Utility in a prudent and efficient manner. The CPUC has interpreted this &#8220;first priority&#8221; obl igation to include the requirement that PG&#38;E Corp oration &#8220;infuse the Utility with all types of capital necessary for the Utility to fulfill its obligation to serve . &#8221; In addition, before the Utility can pay common stock dividends to PG&#38;E Corp oration , the U tility must maintain its authorized capital structure with an average 52% equity component. 
If the Utility were required to pay a material amount of fines or incur material unrecoverable costs in connection with the Northern California wildfires , the Butt e fire , the pending CPUC investigations, the terms of probation or monitorship, or other liabilities or enforcement matters, it would require incremental equity contributions from PG&#38;E Corporation to restore its capital structure. PG&#38;E Corp oration common s tock issuances used to fund such equity contributions could materially dilute earnings per share. (See &#8220;Liquidity and Financ ial Resources&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A ). Further, if PG&#38;E Corp oration were required to infuse the Utility with significant capital or if the Utility w ere unable to distribute cash to PG&#38;E Corporation , or both, PG&#38;E Corporation may be unable to pay principal and interest on its outstanding debt, pay its common stock dividend or meet other obligations. 
In December 2017, the Boards of Directors of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility suspended dividends on common stock of PG&#38;E Corporation and preferred stock of the Utility due to uncertainty related to the causes and potential liabilities associated with the Northern California wildfires. The suspens ion of dividends could continue to materially affect the price of PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s common stock and adversely affect the ability of PG&#38;E Corporation to raise additional equity capital. There can be no assurances as to when, if at all, the Board of Direct ors of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility will determine to re-instate quarterly cash dividends on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s common stock or the Utility&#8217;s preferred stock. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results will be affected by their ability to continue accessing the capital markets and by the terms of debt and equity financings. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility will continue to seek funds in the capital and credit markets to enable the Utility to make capital investments, and to pay fines that may be imposed in the future, as well as costs related to rights-of-way and legal and regulatory costs. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to access the capital and credit markets and the costs and terms of available financing depend primarily o n PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s credit ratings and outlook. Their credit ratings and outlook can be affected by many factors, including pending or anticipated litigation, the pending Cal Fire and CPUC investigations and CPUC ratemaking proceedings, and by the December 20, 2017 decision of the Boards of Directors of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility to suspend dividends, as well as the perceived impact of all such matters on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, whether or not such perception is accurate. On December 21, 2017, Moody's Investor Services and on December 22, 2017, S tandard &#38; P oor&#8217;s Global Ratings, each placed all of the ratings of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility under review for downgrade , and Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Globa l Ratings additionally lowered its ratings on the Utility&#8217;s preferred stock . If PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s or the Utility&#8217;s credit ratings were to be downgraded or the ratings on the Utility&#8217;s preferred stock are further downgraded, in particular to below investm ent grade, their ability to access the capital and credit markets would be negatively affected and could result in higher borrowing costs, fewer financing options, including reduced, or lack of, access to the commercial paper market and additional collater al posting requirements, which in turn could affect liquidity and lead to an increased financing need. Other factors can affect the availability and terms of debt and equity financing, including changes in the federal or state regulatory environment affec ting energy companies generally or PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility in particular, the overall health of the energy industry, an increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve Bank, and general economic and financial market conditions. 
The reputations of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility continue to suffer from the negative publicity about matters discussed under &#8220;Enforcement and Litigation Matters&#8221; in Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 . The negative publicity and the uncertainty about the outcomes of these matters may undermine confidence in management&#8217;s ability to execute its business strategy and restore a constructive regulatory environment, which could adversely impact PG&#38;E Corporati on&#8217;s stock price. Further, the market price of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock could decline materially depending on the outcome of these matters. &#160; The amount and timing of future share issuances also could affect the stock price. 
Risks Related to Operatio ns and Information Technology 
The Utility&#8217;s electricity and natural gas operations are inherently hazardous and involve significant risks which, if they materialize, can adversely affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. &#160; 
The Utility owns and operates extensive electricity and natural gas facilities, including two nuclear generation units and an extensive hydroelectric generating system . (See &#8220;Electric Utility Operations&#8221; and &#8220;Nat ural Gas Utility Operations&#8221; in Item 1. Business.) The Utility&#8217;s ability to earn its authorized ROE depends on its ability to efficiently maintain, operate, and protect its facilities, and provide electricity and natural gas services safely and reliably. The Utility undertakes substantial capital investment projects to construct, replace, and improve its electricity and natural gas facilities. In addition, the Utility is obligated to decommission its electricity generation facilities at the end of their useful operating lives , and the CPUC approved retirement of Diablo Canyon by 2024 and 2025 . The Utility&#8217;s ability to safely and reliably operate, maintain, construct and decommission its facilities is subject to numerous risks, many of which are beyond th e Utility&#8217;s control, including those that arise from: 
the breakdown or failure of equipment, electric transmission or distribution lines, or natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines, that can cause explosions, fires, or other catastrophic eve nts; &#160;
an overpressure event occurring on natural gas facilities due to equipment failure, incorrect operating procedures or failure to follow correct operating procedures, or welding or fabrication-related defects, that results in the failure of downstream transmission pipelines or distribution assets and uncontained natural gas flow; &#160;
the failure to maintain adequate capacity to meet customer demand on the gas system that results in customer curtailments, controlled/uncontrolled gas outages, gas surges back into homes, serious personal injury or loss of life; &#160;
a prolonged statewide electric al black-out that results in damage to the Utility&#8217;s equipment or damage to property owned by customers or other third parties; &#160;
the failure to fully identify, evaluate, and control workplace hazards that result in serious injury or loss of life for emplo yees or the public, environmental damage, or reputational damage; &#160;
the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity, natural disaster, or terrorist act; &#160;
the failure of a large dam or other major hydroelectric facility, o r the failure of one or more levees that protect land on which the Utility&#8217;s assets are built; &#160;
the failure to take expeditious or sufficient action to mitigate operating conditions, facilities, or equipment, that the Utility has identified, or reasonably should have identified, as unsafe, which failure then leads to a catastrophic event (such as a wild land fire or natural gas explosion) ; &#160;
inadequate emergency preparedness plans and the failure to respond effectively to a catastrophic event that can lead to public or employee harm or extended outages; &#160;
operator or other human error; &#160;
an ineffective records management program that results in the failure to construct, operate and maintain a utility system safely and prudently;
construction performed by thir d parties that damage s the Utility&#8217;s underground or overhead facilities, including, for example, ground excavations or &#8220;dig-ins&#8221; that damage the Utility&#8217;s underground pipelines; &#160;
the release of hazardous or toxic substances into the air, water, or soil, in cluding, for example, gas leaks from natural gas storage facilities; flaking lead-based paint from the Utility&#8217;s facilities, and leaking or spilled insulating fluid from electrical equipment; and &#160;
attacks by third parties, including cyber-attacks, acts of terrorism, vandalism, or war. &#160; 
The occurrence of any of these events could interrupt fuel supplies; affect demand for electricity or natural gas; cause unplanned outages or reduce generating output; damage the Utility&#8217;s assets or operations; damage the assets or operations of third parties on which the Utility relies; damage property owned by customers or others; and cause personal injury or death. As a result, the Utility could incur costs to purchase replacement power, to repair assets and restore se rvice, and to compensate third parties. 
Further, although the Utility often enters into agreements for third-party contractors to perform work, such as patrolling and inspection of facilities or the construction or demolition or facilities, the Utility may retain liability for the quality and completion of the contractor&#8217;s work and can be subject to penalties or other enforcement action if the contractor violates applicable laws, rules, regulations, or orders. The Utility may also be subject to liability, penalties or other enforcement action as a result of personal injury or death caused by third-party contractor actions. 
Insurance, equipment warranties, or other contractual indemnification requi rements may not be sufficient or effective to provide full or even partial recovery under all circumstances or against all hazards or liabilities to which the Utility may become subject. An uninsured loss could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The Utility&#8217;s insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover losses caused by an operating failure or catastrophic events, including severe weather events, or m ay not be available at a reasonable cost, or available at all. 
The Utility has experienced increased costs and difficulties in obtaining insurance coverage for wildfires that could arise from the Utility&#8217;s ordinary operations. PG&#38;E Corporation, the Utilit y or its contractors and customers may experience coverage reductions and/or increased wildfire insurance costs in future years. No assurance can be given that future losses will not exceed the limits of the Utility&#8217;s insurance coverage. Uninsured losses a nd increases in the cost of insurance may not be recoverable in customer rates. A loss which is not fully insured or cannot be recovered in customer rates could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operatio ns, liquidity, and cash flows . 
As a result of the potential application of a strict liability standard under the doctrine of inverse condemnation , recent losses recorded by insurance companies, the risk of increase of wildfires including as a result of t he ongoing drought, the Northern California wildfires, and the Butte fire, the Utility may not be able to obtain sufficient insurance coverage in the future at comparable cost and terms as the Utility&#8217;s current insurance coverage, or at all. In addition, the Utility is unable to predict whether it would be allowed to recover in rates the increased costs of insurance or the costs of any uninsured losses. 
Future insurance coverage may not be available at rates and on terms as favorable as the Utility&#8217;s cur rent insurance coverage or may not be available at all. If the amount of insurance is insufficient or otherwise unavailable, or if the Utility is unable to recover in rates the costs of any uninsured losses, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
The electric power industry is undergoing significant change driven by technological advancements and a decarbonized economy, which could materially impact the Utili ty&#8217;s operations, financial condition, and results of operations. 
The electric power industry is undergoing transformative change driven by technological advancements enabling customer choice (for example, customer-owned generation and energy storage) and state climate policy supporting a decarbonized economy. California's environmental policy objectives are accelerating the pace and scope of the industry change. The electric grid is a critical enabler of the adoption of new energy technologies that suppo rt California's climate change and GHG reduction objectives, which continue to be publicly supported by California policymakers notwithstanding a recent change in the federal approach to such matters. California utilities are experiencing increasing deplo yment by customers and third parties of DERs, such as on-site solar generation, energy storage, fuel cells, energy efficiency, and demand response technologies. This growth will require modernization of the electric distribution grid to, among other thing s, accommodate two-way flows of electricity, increase the grid's capacity, and interconnect DERs. 
In order to enable the California clean energy economy, sustained investments are required in grid modernization, renewable integration projects, energy effi ciency programs, energy storage options, EV infrastructure and s tate infrastructure modernization (e.g. rail and water project s ). 
To this end, the CPUC is conducting proceedings to: evaluate changes to the planning and operation of the electric distributi on grid in order to prepare for higher penetration of DERs; consider future grid modernization and grid reinforcement investments; evaluate if traditional grid investments can be deferred by DERs, and if feasible, what, if any, compensation to utilities wo uld be appropriate for enabling those investments ; and clarify the role of the electr ic distribution grid operator. The CPUC has also recently opened proceedings regarding the &#160; creation of a shared database or statewide census of utility poles and conduits in California and increased access by communications providers to utility rights-of-way. &#160; This proceeding could require utilities to invest significant resources into inspecting poles and conduits, limit available capacity in existing rights-of-way, or im pose other requirements on utilities facilities. &#160; The Utility is unable to predict the outcome of these proceedings. &#160; 
In addition, the CPUC has held discussions on potential changes to California&#8217;s electricity market. On May 19, 2017, California energy companies, along with other stakeholders , discussed customer choice and the future of the state&#8217;s electricity industry at a CPUC &#8220;en banc&#8221; meeting. &#160; Specifically, the goal of the &#8220;en banc&#8221; was to frame a discussion on the trends that are driving change wit hin California&#8217;s electricity sector and overall clean-energy economy and to lay out elements of a path forward to ensure that California achieves its reliability, affordability, equity, and carbon reduction imperatives while recognizing the important role that technology and customer preferences wil l play in shaping this future. While the CPUC had indicated its intent to open a proceeding related to customer choice, the Utility is unable to predict whether that remains the CPUC&#8217;s intent or the timing of an y such proceeding. 
The industry change, costs associated with complying with new regulatory developments an d initiatives and with technological advancements, or the Utility&#8217;s inability to successful ly ada pt to changes in the electric industry, could mater ially affect the Utility&#8217;s operations, financial condition , and results of operations. 
A cyber inciden t, cyber security breach , severe natural event or physical attack on the Utility&#8217;s operational networks and information technology systems could have a material effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
The Utility&#8217;s electricity and natural gas sys tems rely on a complex, interconnected network of generation, transmission, distribution, control, and communication technologies, which can be damaged by natural events&#8212;such as severe weather or seismic events&#8212;and by malicious events, such as cyber and ph ysical &#160; attacks. Private and public entities, such as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation , and U.S. Government Departments, including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Energy, and the White House, have noted that cyber-attac ks targeting utility systems are increasing in sophistication, magnitude, and frequency. The Utility&#8217;s operational networks also may face new cyber security risks due to modernizing and interconnecting the existing infrastructure with new technologies and control systems. Any failure or decrease in the functionality of the Utility&#8217;s operational networks could cause harm to the public or employees, significantly disrupt operations, negatively impact the Utility&#8217;s ability &#160; to safely generate, transport, deli ver and store energy and gas or otherwise operate in the most safe and efficient manner or at all, and damage the Utility&#8217;s assets or operations or those of third parties. 
The Utility also relies on complex information technology systems that allow it t o create, collect, use, disclose, store and otherwise process sensitive information, including the Utility&#8217;s financial information, customer energy usage and billing information, and personal information regarding customers, employees and their dependents, contractors, and other individuals. In addition, the Utility often relies on third-party vendors to host, maintain, modify, and update its systems , and to provide other services to the Utility or the Utility&#8217;s customers. These third-party vendors could c ease to exist, &#160; fail to establish adequate processes to protect the Utility&#8217;s systems and information, or experience security incidents or inadequate security measures . &#160; Any incidents or disruptions in the Utility&#8217;s information technology systems could impa ct the Utility&#8217;s ability to track or collect revenues and to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting . 
The Utility and its third party vendors have been subject to, and will likely continue to be subject to attempts to gain unauthori zed access to the Utility&#8217;s information technology systems or confidential data (including information about customers and employees), or to disrupt the Utility&#8217;s operations. &#160; None of these attempts or breaches has individually or in the aggregate resulted in a security incident with a material impact on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations. &#160; Despite implementation of security and control measures, there can be no assurance that the Utility will be able to preve nt the unauthorized access to its operational networks, information technology systems or data, or the disruption of its operations. Such events could subject the Utility to significant expenses, claims by customers or third parties, government inquiries, penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, investigations, and regulatory actions that could result in fines and penalties, loss of customers and harm to PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations. 
The Utility maintains cyber liability insurance that covers certain damages caused by cyber incidents . However, there is no guarantee that adequate insurance wi ll continue to be available at rates the Utility believes are reasonable or that the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident will be covered by insurance or recoverable in rates. 
The operation and decommissioning of the Utility&#8217;s nucle ar generation facilities expose it to potentially significant liabilities and the Utility may not be able to fully recover its costs if regulatory requirements change or the plant ceases operations before the licenses expire. 
The operation of the Utilit y&#8217;s nuclear generation facilities exposes it to potentially significant liabilities from environmental, health and financial risks, such as risks relating to the storage, handling and disposal of spent nuclear fuel, and the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity, natural disaster, or terrorist act. If the Utility incurs losses that are either not covered by insurance or exceed the amount of insurance available, such losses could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corpor ation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows . In addition, the Utility may be required under federal law to pay up to $255 million of liabilities arising out of each nuclear incident occurring not only at the Utility&#8217;s Diablo Canyon facility but at any other nuclear power plant in the United States. &#160; (See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) &#160; &#160; 
On January 11, 2018, the CPUC approved the retirement of Diablo Canyon un its by 2024 and 2025. However, the Utility continues to face public concern about the safety of nuclear generation and nuclear fuel. Some of these nuclear opposition groups regularly file petitions at the NRC and in other forums challenging the actions o f the NRC and urging governmental entities to adopt laws or policies in opposition to nuclear power. Although an action in opposition may ultimately fail, regulatory proceedings may take longer to conclude and be more costly to complete. It is also possi ble that public pressure could grow leading to adverse changes in legislation, regulations, orders, or their interpretation. As a result, operations at the Utility&#8217;s two nuclear generation units at Diablo Canyon could cease before the ir respective license s expire in 2024 and 2025. In such an instance, the Utility could be required to record a charge for the remaining amount of its unrecovered investment and such charge could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
In addition, in order to retain highly skilled personnel necessary to safely operate Diablo Canyon during the remaining years of operations, the Utility will incur costs in connection with (i) an employe e retention program to ensure adequate staffing levels at Diablo Canyon, and (ii) an employee retraining and development program, &#160; to facilitate redeployment of a portion of Diablo Canyon personnel to the decommissioning project and elsewhere in the company . &#160; In its January 11, 2018 decision, the CPUC authorized rate recovery up to $211.3 million (compared with the $352.1 million requested by the Utility) for an employee retention program , but there can be no assurance that the Utility will be successful in retaining highly skilled personnel under such program . 
The Utility has incurred, and may continue to incur, substantial costs to comply with NRC regulations and orders. &#160; (See &#8220;Regulatory Environment&#8221; in Item 1. Business.) &#160; If the Utility were unable to re cover these costs, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected. &#160; The Utility may determine that it cannot comply with the new regulations or orders in a feasible and economic manner and voluntarily cease operations; alternatively, the NRC may order the Utility to cease operations until the Utility can comply with new regulations, orders, or decisions. &#160; The Utility may incur a material charge if it ceases operations at Diablo Canyon&#8217;s two nuclear generation units befor e their respective licenses expire in 2024 and 2025. At December 31, 2017, the Utility&#8217;s unrecovered investment in Diablo Canyon was $1.7 billion. 
On June 28, 2016 the California State Lands Commission approved an extension of the Utility&#8217;s leases of c oastal land occupied by the water intake and discharge structures for the nuclear generation units at Diablo Canyon, to run concurrently with Diablo Canyon&#8217;s current operating licenses. The Utility will be required to obtain an additional lease extension from the State Lands Commission to cover the period of time necessary to decommission the facility. The State Lands Commission and California Coastal Commission will evaluate appropriate environmental mitigation and development conditions associated with the decommissioning project, the costs of which could be substantial. 
The Utility also has an obligation to decommission its electricity generation facilities, including its nuclear facilities, as well as gas transmission system assets, at the end of the ir useful lives. &#160; (See Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8211; Asset Retirement Obligations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement in Item 8.) &#160; The CPUC authorizes the Utility to recover its estimated costs to decommission its nu clear facilities through nuclear decommissioning charges that are collected from customers and held in nuclear decommissioning trusts to be used for the eventual decommissioning of each nuclear unit. &#160; If the Utility&#8217;s actual decommissioning costs, includin g the amounts held in the nuclear decommissioning trusts, exceed estimated costs, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
The Utility purchases its nuclear fuel assemblies from a sole source, Westinghouse. &#160; If Westinghouse experiences business disruptions as a result of Chapter 11 proceedings or its pending acquisition by Brookfield, the Utility could experience disruptions in nuclear fuel supply, &#160; and delays in connection with &#160; its &#160; Diablo Canyon outages &#160; and refuelings. 
The &#160; Utility &#160; purchases its nuclear fuel assemblies &#160; for Diablo Canyon &#160; from a sole source, W estinghouse. &#160; The &#160; Utility &#160; also stores nuclear fuel inventory &#160; at &#160; the &#160; Westinghouse &#160; fuel fabrication facilit y. &#160; In addition, &#160; Westinghouse &#160; provides the &#160; Utility &#160; with &#160; Diablo Canyon &#160; outage support services, nuclear fuel analysis, original equipment manufacturer engineering and parts support. &#160; &#160; On March 29, 2017, Westinghouse filed for Chapter 11 protection in the Unit ed States Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York. &#160; On January 4, 2018, Westinghouse announced that it has agreed to be acquired by Brookfield Business Partners L.P. Westinghouse also indicated that its acquisition by Brookfield is expected to clos e in the third quarter of 2018, subject to Bankruptcy Court approval and customary closing conditions including, among others, regulatory approvals. &#160; In the event &#160; that &#160; Westinghouse experiences business disruptions &#160; in its nuclear fuel business as a result o f bankruptcy proceedings, its pending acquisition by Brookfield, or otherwise, the Utility could experience issues with its nuclear fuel supply and &#160; delays in connection with &#160; Diablo Canyon refueling &#160; outages. &#160; 
Diablo Canyon&#8217;s Unit 2 refueling outage will oc cur in the first quarter of 2018 and the required fuel for that outage has been delivered. &#160; The next Unit 1 refueling outage is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2019 and the fuel for that outage has not yet been fabricated. &#160; If Westinghouse were t o fail to deliver nuclear fuel or provide &#160; outage support to the Utility, the &#160; Utility&#8217;s operation of &#160; Diablo Canyon &#160; would be adversely affected. &#160; PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility &#160; also could experience additional costs, including decreased electricity market revenues, in the event that &#160; one or both &#160; Diablo Canyon &#160; units are unable to operate. &#160; There can be no assurance that any such additional costs would be recoverable in the rates the &#160; Utility &#160; is permitted to recover from its customers. &#160; &#160; Furthermore, the &#160; Utility currently is not able to &#160; estimate the nature or amount of additional costs and expenses that it might incur in connection with the uncertainties surrounding &#160; Westinghouse but such costs and expenses could be material. 
For certain critical technologies, pr oducts and services, the Utility relies on a limited number of suppliers and, in some cases, sole suppliers. &#160; In the event these suppliers are unable to perform, the Utility could experience delays and disruptions in its operations while it transitions to alternative plans or suppliers. 
The Utility relies on a limited number of sole source suppliers for certain of its technologies, products and services. &#160; Although the Utility has long-term agreements with such suppliers, if the suppliers are unable to deliver these technologies, products or services, the Utility could experience delays and disruptions while it implements alternative plans and makes arrangements with acceptable substitute suppliers. &#160; As a result, the Utility&#8217;s business, financial conditi on, and results of operations could be significantly affected. &#160; As an example, the Utility relies on Silver Spring Networks, Inc. and Aclara Technologies LLC as suppliers of proprietary SmartMeter&#8482; &#160; devices and software, and of managed services, utilized in its advanced metering system that collects electric and natural gas usage data from customers. &#160; &#160; If these suppliers encounter performance difficul ties or are unable to supply these devices or maintain and update their software, or provide other services to maintain these systems, the Utility&#8217;s metering, billing, and electric network operations could be impacted and disrupted. 
Risks Related to Environmental Factors
Severe weather conditions, extended dro ught and shifting climate patter ns could materially a ffect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. 
Extreme weather, extended drought and shifting climate patterns have intensified the challenges associated with wildfire management in California. Environmental extremes, such as drought conditions followed by periods of wet weather, can drive additional vegetation growth ( which then fuel any fires ) and influence both the likelihood and severity of extraordinary wildfire events. &#160; In Ca lifornia, over the past five years, inconsistent and extreme precipitation, coupled with more hot summer days, have increased the wildfire risk and made wildfire outbreaks increasingly difficult to manage. &#160; In particular, the risk posed by wildfires has inc reased in the Utility&#8217;s service area (the Utility has approximately 82,000 distribution overhead circuit miles and 18,000 transmis sion overhead circuit miles) as a result of an extended period of drought, bark beetle infestations in the California forest a nd wildfire fuel increases due to record rainfall following the drought, among other environmental factors. Other contributing factors include local land use policies and historical forestry management practices. The combined effects of extreme weather and climate change also impact this risk. 
Severe weather events , including wildfires and other fires, storms, tornadoes, floods, drought, earthquakes, tsunamis, pandemics, solar events, electromagnetic events, or other natural disasters such as wildfires, c ould result in severe business disruptions, prolonged power outages, property damage, injuries or loss of life, significant decreases in revenues and earnings, and/or significant additional costs to PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility. Any such event could ha ve a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s business , financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows . &#160; If the Utility is unable to recover its wildfire costs, due to the reasons described in the risk factors related t o the Northern California fires, Butte fire, the doctrine of inverse condemnation, and insurance limitations above, or for other reasons, its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
Further, the Utility has been studying the potential effects of climate change (increased temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, rising sea levels) on the Utility&#8217;s operations and is developing contingency plans to adapt to those events and conditions that the Utility believes are most significant. Scientists project that climate change will increase electricity demand due to more extreme, persistent and hot weather. As a result, the Utility&#8217;s hydroelectric generation could change and the Utility would need t o consider managing or acquiring additional generation. &#160; If the Utility increases its reliance on conventional generation resources to replace hydroelectric generation and to meet increased customer demand, it may become more costly for the Utility to comp ly with GHG emissions limits. In addition, flooding caused by rising sea levels could damage the Utility&#8217;s facilities, including generation and electric transmission and distribution assets. The Utility could incur substantial costs to repair or replace f acilities, restore service, or compensate customers and other third parties for damages or injuries. The Utility anticipates that the increased costs would be recovered through rates, but as rate pressures increase, the likelihood of disallowance or non-r ecovery may increase. 
Events or conditions caused by climate change could have a greater impact on the Utility&#8217;s operations than the Utility&#8217;s studies suggest and could result in lower revenues or incr eased expenses, or both. If the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility&#8217;s rates to reflect the impact of events or conditions caused by climate change, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows cou ld be materially affected. 
The Utility&#8217;s operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and changes in or liabilities under these laws could adversely affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results. 
The Utility&#8217;s operations are su bject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws, regulations, and orders, relating to air quality, water quality and usage, remediation of hazardous wastes, and the protection and conservation of natural resources and wildlife. The Utility incurs significant capital, operating, and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental statutes, rules, and regulations. The Utility has been in the past, and may be in the future, required to pay for environmental remediation costs a t sites where it is identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws. Although the Utility has recorded liabilities for known environmental obligations, these costs can be difficult to estimate due to uncertainties about the extent of contamination, remediation alternatives, the applicable remediation levels, and the financial ability of other pote ntially responsible parties. (For more information, s ee Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) 
Environmental remediation costs could increase in the future as a result of new legislation, the current trend toward more stringent standards, and stricter and more expansive application of existing environmental regulations. Failure to compl y with these laws and regulations, or failure to comply with the terms of licenses or permits issued by environmental or regulatory agencies, could expose the Utility to claims by third parties or the imposition of civil or criminal fines or other sanction s. 
The CPUC has authorized the Utility to recover its environmental remediation costs for certain sites through various ratemaking mechanisms. One of these mechanisms allows the Utility rate recovery for 90% of its hazardous substance remediation costs for certain approved sites without a reasonableness review. The CPUC may discontinue or change these ratemaking mechanisms in the future or the Utility may incur environmental costs that exceed amounts the CPUC has authorized the Utility to recover in ra tes. 
Some of the Utility&#8217;s environmental costs, such as the remediation costs associated with the Hinkley natural gas compressor site, are not recoverable through rates or insurance. (See &#8220;Environmental Regulation&#8221; in Item 1. and Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) The Utility&#8217;s costs to remediate groundwater contamination near the Hinkley natural gas compressor site and to abate the effects of the contamination have had, and may continue to have, a material effect o n PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results. Their financial results also can be materially affected by changes in estimated costs and by the extent to which actual remediation costs differ from recorded liabilities. 
State climate policy requires reductions in greenhouse gases of 40% by 2030 and 80% by 2050. &#160; Various proposals for addressing these reductions have the potential to reduce natural gas usage and increase natural gas costs. The future recovery of the increased costs associated with compliance is uncertain. 
The CARB is the state&#8217;s primary regulator for GHG emission reduction programs. &#160; Natural gas providers have been subject to compliance with CARB&#8217;s Cap-and-Trade Program since 2015, and natural gas end-use customers have an inc reasing exposure to carbon costs under the Program through 2030 when the full cost will be reflected in customer bills. CARB&#8217;s Scoping Plan also proposes various methods of reducing GHG emissions from natural gas. &#160; These include more aggressive energy eff iciency programs to reduce natural gas end use, increased renewable portfolio standards generation in the electric sector reducing noncore gas load, and replacement of natural gas appliances with electric appliances, leading to further reduced demand. &#160; The se natural gas load reductions may be partially offset by CARB&#8217;s proposals to deploy natural gas to replace wood fuel in home heating and diesel in transportation applications. &#160; CARB also proposes a displacement of some conventional natural gas with above- market renewable natural gas. &#160; The combination of reduced load and increased costs could result in higher natural gas customer bills and a potential mandate to deliver renewable natural gas could lead to cost recovery risk. 
Other Risk Factors
The Utility may be required to incur substantial costs in order to obtain or renew licenses and permits needed to operate the Utility&#8217;s business and the Utility may be subject to fines and penalties for failure to comply or obtain license renewal. 
The Utility must c omply with the terms of various governmental permits, authorizations, and licenses, including those issued by the FERC for the continued operation of the Utility&#8217;s hydroelectric generation facilities, and those issued by environmental and other federal, st ate and local governmental agencies. Many of the Utility&#8217;s capital investment projects, and some maintenance activities, often require the Utility to obtain land use, construction, environmental, or other governmental permits. These permits, authorizatio ns, and licenses may be difficult to obtain on a timely basis, causing work delays. Further, existing permits and licenses could be revoked or modified by the agencies that granted them if facts develop that differ significantly from the facts assumed whe n they were issued. In addition, the Utility often seeks periodic renewal of a license or permit, such as a waste discharge permit or a FERC operating license for a hydroelectric generation facility. 
If a license or permit is not renewed for a particul ar facility and the Utility is required to cease operations at that facility, the Utility could incur an impairment charge or other costs. Before renewing a permit or license, the issuing agency may impose additional requirements that may increase the Uti lity&#8217;s compliance costs. In particular, in connection with a license renewal for one or more of the Utility&#8217;s hydroelectric generation facilities or assets, the FERC may impose new license conditions that could, among other things, require increased expen ditures or result in reduced electricity output and/or capacity at the facility. 
In addition, local governments may attempt to assert jurisdiction over various utility operations by requiring permits or other approvals that the Utility has no t been previously required to obtain. &#160; 
The Utility may incur penalties and sanctions for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of licenses and permits which could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial conditio n, results of operations, and cash flows. If the Utility cannot obtain, renew, or comply with necessary governmental permits, authorizations, licenses, ordinances, or other requirements, or if the Utility cannot recover the increase in associated complian ce and other costs in a timely manner, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
Poor investment performance or other factors could require PG&#38;E Corporation an d the Utility to make significant unplanned contributions to its pension plan, other postretirement benefits plans, and nuclear decommissioning trusts. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility provide defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit s for eligible employees and retirees. The Utility also maintains three trusts for the purposes of providing funds to decommission its nuclear facilities. The performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of plan assets and trust assets. A decline in the market value may increase the funding requirements for these plans and trusts. The cost of providing pension and other postretirement benefits is also affected by other factors, including interest rates used to measure the required minimu m funding levels, the rate of return on plan assets, employee demographics, discount rates used in determining future benefit obligations, rates of increase in health care costs, future government regulation, and prior contributions to the plans. Similarl y, funding requirements for the nuclear decommissioning trusts are affected by the rates of return on trust assets, changes in the laws or regulations regarding nuclear decommissioning or decommissioning funding requirements as well as changes in assumptio ns or forecasts related to decommissioning dates, technology and the cost of labor, materials and equipment. (See Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) If the Utility is requi red to make significant unplanned contributions to fund the pension and postretirement plans or if actual nuclear decommissioning costs exceed the amount of nuclear decommissioning trust funds and the Utility is unable to recover the contributions or addit ional costs in rates, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
The Utility&#8217;s success depends on the availability of the services of a qualified workforce and i ts ability to maintain satisfactory collective bargaining agreements which cover a substantial number of employees. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s results may suffer if the Utility is unable to attract and retain qualified personnel and senior manag ement talent, or if prolonged labor disruptions occur. 
The Utility&#8217;s workforce is aging and many employees are or will become eligible to retire within the next few years. Although the Utility has undertaken efforts to recruit and train new field service personnel, the Utility may be faced with a shortage of experienced and qualified personnel. The majority of the Utility&#8217;s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with three unions. Labor disruptions could occur depending on the outcome of negotiations to renew the terms of these agreements with the unions or if tentative new agreements are not ratified by their members. In addition, some of the remaining non-represented Utility employees could join one of these unions in the future. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility also may face challenges in attracting and retaining senior management talent especially if they are unable to restore the reputational harm generated by the negative publicity stemming from the ongoing enforcement proceed ings. Any such occurrences could negatively impact PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations. 
The Utility&#8217;s business activities are concentrated in one region, as a result of which, its future performance may be a ffected by events and factors unique to California. 
The Utility&#8217;s business act ivities are concentrated in Northern California. As a result, the Utility&#8217;s future performance may be affected by events and e conomic factors unique to California or by regional regulation or legislation , for example the doctrine of inverse condemnation . &#160; (See &#8220; The doctrine of inverse condemnation, if applied by courts in litigation to which PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility are s ubject, could significantly expand the potential liabilities from such litigation and materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows &#8221; above.)

PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results can be affected by ma ny factors, including estimates and assumptions used in the critical accounting policies described in MD&#38;A, that can cause their actual financial results to differ materially from historical results or from anticipated future financial results. The follow ing discussion of key risk factors should be considered in evaluating an investment in PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility and should be read in conjunction with MD&#38;A and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial S tatements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this Form 10-K. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price. 
Risks Related to the Outc ome of Enforcement Matters, Investigations, and Regulatory Proceedings 
PG&#38;E Corporation &#8217;s and the Utility &#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially affected by the ultimate amount of third-party liability that the Utility incurs in connection with the Butte fire. 
In September 2015, a wildfire (known as the &#8220;Butte fire&#8221;) ignited and spread in Amador and Calaveras Counties in Northern California. &#160; On April 28, 2016, Cal Fire released its report of the investigation o f the origin and cause of the wildfire. &#160; According to Cal Fire&#8217;s report, the fire burned 70,868 acres, resulted in two fatalities, destroyed 549 homes, 368 outbuildings and four commercial properties, and damaged 44 structures. &#160; Cal Fire&#8217;s report concluded that the wildfire was caused when a Gray Pine tree contacted the Utility&#8217;s electric line which ignited portions of the tree, and determined that the failure by the Utility and/or its vegetation management contractors, ACRT Inc. and Trees, Inc., to identif y certain potential hazards during its vegetation management program ultimately led to the failure of the tree. &#160; In a press release also issued on April 28, 2016, Cal Fire indicated that it will seek to recover firefighting costs in excess of $90 million f rom the Utility. 
On May 23, 2016, individual plaintiffs filed a master complaint against the Utility and its two vegetation management contractors in the Superior Court of California for Sacramento County. &#160; Subrogation insurers also filed a separate maste r complaint on the same date. &#160; The California Judicial Council had previously authorized the coordination of all cases in Sacramento County. &#160; As of December 31, 2016, complaints have been filed against the Utility and its two vegetation management contract ors in the Superior Court of California in the Counties of Calaveras, San Francisco, Sacramento, and Amador involving approximately 1,950 individual plaintiffs representing approximately 950 households and their insurance companies. &#160; These complaints are p art of or are in the process of being added to the two master complaints. &#160; Plaintiffs seek to recover damages and other costs, principally based on inverse condemnation and negligence theories of liability. &#160; The number of individual complaints and plaintif fs may increase in the future. &#160; 
In connection with this matter, the Utility may be liable for property damages, interest, and attorneys&#8217; fees without having been found negligent, through the theory of inverse condemnation. In addition, the Utility may b e liable for fire suppression costs, personal injury damages, and other damages if the Utility were found to have been negligent. &#160; The Utility believes that it is probable that it will incur a loss of at least $750 million for all pote ntial damages describ ed above. The Utility has liability insurance from various insurers, which provides coverage for third-party liability attributable to the Butte fire in an aggregate amount of approximately $900 million. Such insurance coverage is subject to the terms and limitations of the available policies and may not be sufficient to cover the Utility&#8217;s u ltimate liability. 
The process for estimating costs associated with claims relating to the Butte fire requires management to exercise significant judgment based on a number of assumptions and subjective factors. &#160; As more information becomes known, includ ing additional discovery from the plaintiffs and results from the ongoing mediation and settlement process, management estimates and assumptions regarding the financial impact of the Butte fire may change. &#160; A change in management&#8217;s estimates or assumptions could result in an adjustment that could have a material impact on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition and the results of operations during the period such change occurred. &#160; 
If the Utility records losses in connection with claims re lating to the Butte fire that materially exceed the amount the Utility accrued for these liabilities, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially affected in the reporting periods durin g which additional charges are recorded, depending on whether the Utility is able to record or collect insurance recoveries in amounts sufficient to offset such additional accruals. (For more information, see &#8220;Enforcement and Litigation Matters&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A and in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s future financial results may be materially affected by the outcomes of the CPUC&#8217;s investigative enforcement proceedings against the Utility, other known enforcement matters, and other ongoing state and federal investigation s and requests for information. The Utility also could incur material costs and fines in connection with future investigations, citations, audits, or enforcement a ctions. 
The Utility could incur material charges, including fines and other penalties, in connection with a potential settlement or litigated outcome of the CPUC&#8217;s investigation of the Utility&#8217;s compliance with the CPUC&#8217;s rules re garding ex parte communications . While on October 14, 2016, the Cities of San Bruno and San Carlos, ORA, the SED, TURN, and the Utility submitted a status report to the CPUC which proposed an update to the framework for resolving the proceeding and included a total of 164 com munications in the scope of the proceeding, the Utility expects that the other parties may argue that the number of violations exceeds the 164 communications referenced in the status report either because a single communication may have violated more than one rule or because they believe some of the material provided during discovery constitutes impermissible ex parte communications. The Utility expects to contest many of these assertions. If the matter does not settle, the CPUC will determine which commu nications included within the scope of the proceeding were in violation of its rules. The CPUC will also determine whether to impose penalties or other remedies, as a result of a potential settlement or otherwise. The CPUC can impose fines up to $50,000 for each violation, and up to $50,000 per day if the CPUC determines that the violation was continuing. The CPUC has wide discretion to determine the amount of penalties based on the totality of the circumstances, including such factors as how many days e ach violation continued; the gravity of the violations; the type of harm caused by the violations and the number of persons affected; and the good faith of the entity charged in attempting to achieve compliance, after notification of a violation. The CPUC is also required to consider the appropriateness of the amount of the penalty to the size of the entity charged. The CPUC has historically exercised broad discretion in determining whether violations are continuing and the amount of penalties to be impos ed. While it is uncertain how the CPUC will calculate the number of violations or the penalty for any violations, such fines or penalties could be significant and materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s liquidity and results of operations. (See the discussion under the heading &#8220;Regulatory Matters&#8221; in MD&#38;A.) 
The Utility also is a target of a number of investigations and government requests for information. In 2014, both the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco and the California Attorne y General's office opened investigations into matters related to allegedly improper communication between the Utility and CPUC personnel. &#160; In addition, in October 2016, the Utility received a grand jury subpoena and letter from the U.S. Attorney for the No rthern District of California advising that the Utility is a target of a federal investigation regarding possible criminal violations of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and conspiracy to violate the act. The Utility was also contacted by certain other federa l agencies with requests for information. While the Utility believes that these requests for information are routine, their outcome is uncertain. The Utility also is unable to predict the outcome of pending investigations, including whether any charges wil l be brought against the Utility. 
If these investigations or requests for information result in enforcement action against the Utility, the Utility could incur additional fines or penalties or suffer negative consequences described above in the immediatel y preceding risk factor. In addition, a negative outcome in any of these investigations or future enforcement actions may negatively affect the outcome of future ratemaking and regulatory proceedings; for example, by enabling parties to challenge the Util ity&#8217;s request to recover costs that the parties allege are somehow related to the Utility&#8217;s violations. 
The Utility may incur fines and penalties in connection with the Utility&#8217;s efforts to identify and remove encroachments from transmission pipeline r ights of way and the Penalty Decision. The Penalty Decision requires the SED to review the Utility&#8217;s gas transmission operations (including the Utility&#8217;s compliance with the remedies ordered by the Penalty Decision) and to perform annual audits of the Uti lity&#8217;s record-keeping practices for a minimum of ten years. The SED could impose fines on the Utility or require the Utility to incur unrecoverable costs, or both, based on the outcome of these future audits. In addition, although PG&#38;E Corporation and th e Utility do not currently face the possibility of fines or penalties in the first phase of the CPUC&#8217;s pending investigation into the Utility&#8217;s safety culture since it has been categorized as rate setting, it is uncertain how a next phase , if any, would be categorized. (See the discussion under the heading &#8220;Regulatory Matters&#8221; in MD&#38;A.) 
The Utility could be subject to additional regulatory or governmental enforcement action in the future with respect to compliance with federal, state or local laws, regulations or orders that could result in additional fines, penalties or customer refunds, including those regarding renewable energy and resource adequacy requirements; customer billing; customer service; affiliate transactions; vegetation management; de sign, construction, operating and maintenance practices; safety and inspection practices; compliance with CPUC general orders or other applicable CPUC decisions or regulations; federal electric reliability standards; and environmental compliance. CPUC sta ff could impose penaltie s on the Utility in the future in accordance with its authority under the gas and electric safety citation programs. The amount of such fines, penalties, or customer refunds could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and th e Utility&#8217;s financial results. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s future financial results could be materially affected by the conviction of the Utility in the federal criminal proceeding and by the debarment proceeding . 
On August 9, 2016, the jury in the federal criminal trial against the Utility in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, in San Francisco, found the Utility guilty on one count of obstructing a federal agency proceeding and five counts of violations of pipeline integrity management regulations of the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act. On January 26, 2017, the court issued a judgment of conviction against the Utility. The court sentenced the Utility to a five- year corporate probation period, oversight by a third-party monitor for a period of five years, with the ability to apply for early termination after three years , a fine of $3 million to be paid to the federal government, certain advertising requirements, and community service. The Utility has dec ided not to appeal the convictions. 
The probation includes a requirement that the Utility not commit any local, state or federal crimes during the probation period. As part of the probation, the Utility is required to retain a third-party monitor. The goal of the monitorship will be to prevent the criminal conduct with respect to gas pipeline transmission safety that gave rise to the conviction. To that end, the goal of the monitor will be to help ensure that the Utility takes reasonable and appropriat e steps to maintain the safety of the gas transmission pipeline system, performs appropriate integrity management assessments on its gas transmission pipelines, and maintains an effective ethics and compliance program and safety related incentive program. 
After an initial assessment is conducted and an initial report is prepared by the monitor, the monitor will prepare reports on a semi -annual basis setting forth the monitor&#8217;s continued assessment and making recommendations consistent with the goals and sc ope of the monitorship. The Utility expects that the monitor will be retained before the end of the second quarter of 2017. 
At December 31, 2016, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets include d a $3 million accrual in connection wi th this matter. The Utility could incur material costs and additional penalties , not recoverable through rates, in the event of non-compliance with the terms of its probation and in connection with the monitorship (including but not limited to the monitor&#8217; s compensation or costs resulting from recommendations of the monitor). 
Also, in September 2015, the Utility was notified that the DOI had initiated an inquiry into whether the Utility should be suspended or debarred from entering into federal procurement and non-procurement contracts and programs citing the San Bruno explosion and indicating, as the basis for the inquiry, alleged poor record-keeping, poor identification and evaluation of threats to gas lines and obstruction of the NTSB&#8217;s investigation. On December 21, 2016, the Utility and the DOI entered into an interim administrative agreement that reflects the DOI&#8217;s determination that the Utility remains eligible to contract with federal government agencies while the DOI determines whether any further a ction is necessary to protect the federal government&#8217;s business interests. The agreement will be effective until superseded by an amended agreement or determination. The agreement also provides that the DOI is still conducting a review to determine whether the Utility has an effective compliance and ethics program and that the DOI is required to use its best efforts to complete its review before the end of 2017. If the DOI determines that the Utility&#8217;s program is not generally effective in preventing and de tecting criminal conduct, the Utility may be required to enter into an amended administrative agreement and implement remedial and other measures, such as a requirement that the Utility&#8217;s natural gas operations and/or compliance and eth ics programs be supe rvised by one or more independent third party monitor (s) . 
The Utility&#8217;s conviction and the outcome of the debarment proceeding could harm the Utility&#8217;s relationships with regulators, legislators, communities, business partners, or other constituencies and make it more difficult to recruit qualified personnel and senior management. &#160; Further, they could negatively affect the outcome of future ratemaking and regulatory proceedings, for example by, enabling parties to argue that the Utility should not be allow ed to recover costs that the parties allege are somehow related to the criminal charges on which the Utility was found guilty. They could also result in increased regulatory or legislative scrutiny with respect to various aspects of how the Utility&#8217;s busi ness is conducted or organized. &#160; As discussed under the heading &#8220;Regulatory Matters&#8221; &#160; in Item 7. MD&#38;A, the SED continues evaluating PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and &#160; the Utility&#8217;s &#160; organizational culture and governance in the CPUC&#8217;s pending investigation to examine th e Utility&#8217;s safety culture. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results primarily depend on the outcomes of regulatory and ratemaking proceedings and the Utility&#8217;s ability to manage its operating expenses and capital expenditures so that it i s able to earn its authorized rate of return in a timely manner. 
As a regulated entity, the Utility&#8217;s rates are set by the CPUC or the FERC on a prospective basis and are generally designed to allow the Utility to collect sufficient revenues to recover r easonable costs of providing service, including a return on its capital investments. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected if the CPUC or the FERC does not authorize sufficient revenues for the Utility to safe ly and reliably serve its customers and earn its authorized ROE. The outcome of the Utility&#8217;s ratemaking proceedings can be affected by many factors, including the Utility&#8217;s reputation (especially as a result of the Utility&#8217;s conviction in the federal cri minal trial ), the level of opposition by intervening parties; potential rate impacts; increasing levels of regulatory review; changes in the political, regulatory, or legislative environments; and the opinions of the Utility&#8217;s regulators, consumer and othe r stakeholder organizations, and customers, about the Utility&#8217;s ability to provide safe, reliable, and affordable electric and gas services. 
The Utility also is required to incur costs to comply with legislative and regulatory requirements and initiatives , such as those relating to the development of a state-wide electric vehicle charging infrastructure, the deployment of distributed energy resources, implementation of demand response and customer energy efficiency programs, energy storage and renewable en ergy targets, underground gas storage, and the construction of the California high-speed rail project. The Utility&#8217;s ability to recover costs, including its investments, associated with these and other legislative and regulatory initiatives will, in large part, depend on the final form of legislative or regulatory requirements, and whether the associated ratemaking mechanisms can be timely adjusted to reflect changes in customer demand for the Utility&#8217;s electricity and natural gas services. 
In addition to the amount of authorized revenues, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected if the Utility&#8217;s actual costs to safely and reliably serve its customers differ from authorized or forecast costs. The Utility may in cur additional costs for many reasons including changing market circumstances, unanticipated events (such as storms, fires, accidents, catastrophic or other events affecting the Utility&#8217;s operations), or compliance with new state laws or policies. Althoug h the Utility may be allowed to recover some or all of the additional costs, there may be a substantial time lag between when the Utility incurs the costs and when the Utility is authorized to collect revenues to recover such costs. Alternatively, the CPU C or the FERC may disallow costs that they determine were not reasonably or prudently incurred by the Utility. 
The Utility&#8217;s ability to recover its costs also may be affected by the economy and its impact on the Utility&#8217;s customers. For example, a sust ained downturn or sluggishness in the economy could reduce the Utility&#8217;s sales to industrial and commercial customers or the level of uncollectible bills could increase. Although the Utility generally recovers its costs through rates, regardless of sales volume, rate pressures increase when the costs are borne by a smaller sales base. 
Changes in commodity prices also may have an adverse effect on the Utility&#8217;s ability to timely recover its operating costs and earn its authorized ROE. &#160; Although the Utility generally recovers its electricity and natural gas procurement costs from customers as &#8220;pass-through&#8221; costs, a significant and sustained rise in commodity prices could create overall rate pressures that make it more difficult for the Utility to rec over its costs that are not categorized as &#8220;pass-through&#8221; costs. &#160; To relieve some of this upward rate pressure, the CPUC could authorize lower revenues than the Utility requested or disallow full cost recovery. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s finan cial results depend upon the Utility&#8217;s continuing ability to recover &#8220;pass-through&#8221; costs, including electricity and natural gas procurement costs, from customers in a timely manner. The CPUC may disallow procurement costs for a variety of reasons. In a ddition, the Utility&#8217;s ability to recover these costs could be affected by the loss of Utility customers and decreased new customer growth , if the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility&#8217;s rates to reflect such events. 
The Utility meets customer demand for elect ricity from a variety of sources, including electricity generated from the Utility&#8217;s own generation facilities, electricity provided by third parties under power purchase agreements, and purchases on the wholesale electricity market. &#160; The Utility must mana ge these sources using the commercial and CPUC regulatory principles of &#8220;least cost dispatch&#8221; and prudent administration of power purchase agreements in compliance with its CPUC-approved long-term procurement plan. The CPUC could disallow procurement cost s incurred by the Utility if the CPUC determines that the Utility did not comply with these principles or if the Utility did not comply with its procurement plan. 
Further, the contractual prices for electricity under the Utility&#8217;s current or future powe r purchase agreements could become uneconomic in the future for a variety of reasons, including developments in alternative energy technology, increased self-generation by customers, an increase in distributed generation, and lower customer demand due to a dverse economic conditions or the loss of the Utility&#8217;s customers to other retail providers. &#160; In particular, the Utility will incur additional costs to procure renewable energy to meet the higher targets established by California SB 350 that became effecti ve on January 1, 2016. Despite the CPUC&#8217;s current approval of the contracts, the CPUC could disallow contract costs in the future if it determines that the costs are unreasonably above market. 
The Utility&#8217;s ability to recover the costs it incurs in the wholesale electricity market may be affected by whether the CAISO wholesale electricity market continues to function effectively. Although market mechanisms are designed to limit excessive prices, these market mechanisms could fail, or the related system s and software on which the market mechanisms rely may not perform as intended which could result in excessive market prices. &#160; The CPUC could prohibit the Utility from passing through the higher costs of electricity to customers. For example, during the 2 000 and 2001 energy crisis, the market mechanism flaws in California&#8217;s then-newly established wholesale electricity market led to dramatically high market prices for electricity that the Utility was unable to recover through customer rates, ultimately caus ing the Utility to file a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
Further, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be affected by the loss of Utility customers and decreasing bundled load that occurs through municipalization of the Utility&#8217;s facilities, an increase in the number of CCAs who provide electricity to their residents, and an increase in the number of consumers who become direct access customers of alternative generation providers. (See &#8220;Co mpetition in the Electricity Industry&#8221; in Item 1.) As the number of bundled customers (i.e., those customers who receive electricity and distribution service from the Utility) declines, the rates for remaining customers could increase as the Utility would have a smaller customer base from which to recover certain procurement costs. Although the Utility is permitted to collect non-bypassable charges for above market generation-related costs incurred on behalf of former customers, the charges may not be suf ficient for the Utility to fully recover these costs. In addition, the Utility&#8217;s ability to collect non-bypassable charges has been, and may continue to be, challenged by certain customer groups. Furthermore, if the former customers return to receiving e lectricity supply from the Utility, the Utility could incur costs to meet their electricity needs that it may not be able to timely recover through rates or that it may not be able to recover at all. 
In addition, increasing levels of self-generation of e lectricity by customers (primarily solar installations) and the use of customer net energy metering (&#8220;NEM&#8221;), which allows self-generating customers to receive bill credits for surplus power at the full retail rate, puts upward rate pressure on remaining cu stomers. &#160; In January 2016, the CPUC adopted new NEM rules and rates. &#160; The new rules and rates became effective for new NEM customers of the Utility in December 2016. &#160; New NEM customers will be required to pay an interconnection fee, will go on time of use rates, and will be required to pay some non-bypassable charges to help fund some of the costs of low income, energy efficiency, and other programs that other customers pay. &#160; However, the resulting rules will still put upward rate pressure on remaining cust omers, and remove the cap on the number of NEM customers. &#160; Significantly higher bills for remaining customers may result in a decline of the number of such customers as they may seek alternative energy providers. The CPUC states that it intends to revisit these rules in 2019. 
A confluence of technology-related cost declines and sustained federal or state subsidies could make a combination of distributed generation and energy storage a viable, cost-effective alternative to the Utility&#8217;s bundled electric se rvice which could further threaten the Utility&#8217;s ability to recover its generation, transmission, and distribution investments. If the number of the Utility&#8217;s customers decreases or grows at a slower rate than anticipated, the Utility&#8217;s level of capital i nvestment would likely decline as well, in turn leading to a slower growth in rate base and earnings. Reduced energy demand or significantly slowed growth in demand due to customer migration to other energy providers, adoption of energy efficient technolo gy, conservation, increasing levels of distributed generation and self-generation, unless substantially offset through regulatory cost allocations, could adversely impact PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results. 
The CPUC has begun to impl ement rate reform to allow residential electric rates to more closely reflect the utilities&#8217; actual costs of providing service and decrease cost-subsidization among customer classes. Many aspects of rate reform are not yet finalized, including time-of-use rates and whether the utilities can impose a fixed charge on certain customers. If the Utility is unable to recover a material portion of its procurement costs and/or if the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility&#8217;s rates to reflect the impact of changing loads , the wide deployment of distributed generation, and the development of new electricity generation and energy storage technologies, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected. 
Risks Related to Liquidity and Cap ital Requirements 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results will be affected by their ability to continue accessing the capital markets and by the terms of debt and equity financings. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility will continue to seek funds in the capital and credit markets to enable the Utility to make capital investments, pay fines that may be imposed in the future, as well as costs related to rights-of-way and legal and regulatory costs. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to access the capital and credit markets and the costs and terms of available financing depend primarily on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s credit ratings and outlook. Their credit ratings and outlook can be affected by many factors, including the pe nding CPUC investigations and ratemaking proceedings. If PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s or the Utility&#8217;s credit ratings were downgraded to below investment grade, their ability to access the capital and credit markets would be negatively affected and could result in higher borrowing costs, fewer financing options, including reduced, or lack of, access to the commercial paper market, additional collateral posting requirements, which in turn could affect liquidity and lead to an increased financing need. Other factors can affect the availability and terms of debt and equity financing, including changes in the federal or state regulatory environment affecting energy companies generally or PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility in particular, the overall health of the energy in dustry, volatility in electricity or natural gas prices, an increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve Bank, and general economic and financial market conditions. 
The reputations of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility continue to suffer from the negat ive publicity about matters discussed under &#8220;Enforcement and Litigation Matters&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A. The negative publicity and the uncertainty about the outcomes of these matters may undermine confidence in management&#8217;s ability to execute its business strat egy and restore a constructive regulatory environment, which could adversely impact PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s stock price. Further, the market price of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock could decline materially depending on the outcome of these matters. &#160; The amount and timing of future share issuances also could affect the stock price. 
If the Utility were unable to access the capital markets, it could be required to decrease or suspend dividends to PG&#38;E Corporation and PG&#38;E Corporation could be required to contrib ute capital to the Utility to enable the Utility to fulfill its obligation to serve. To maintain PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s dividend level in these circumstances, PG&#38;E Corporation would be further required to access the capital or credit markets. PG&#38;E Corporatio n may need to decrease or discontinue its common stock dividend if it is unable to access the capital or credit markets on reasonable terms. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s ability to meet its debt service and other financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the Utility&#8217;s earnings and cash flows. 
PG&#38; E Corporation is a holding company with no revenue generating operations of its own. The Utility must use its resources to satisfy its own obligations, including its obligation to serve customers, to pay principal and interest on outstanding debt, to pay preferred stock dividends, and meet its obligations to employees and creditors, before it can distribute cash to PG&#38;E Corporation. Under the CPUC&#8217;s rules applicable to utility holding companies, the Utility&#8217;s dividend policy must be established by the Uti lity's Board of Directors as though the Utility were a stand-alone utility company and PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s Board of Directors give &#8220;first priority&#8221; to the Utility&#8217;s capital requirements, as determined to be necessary and prudent to meet the Utility&#8217;s obliga tion to serve or to operate the Utility in a prudent and efficient manner. The CPUC has interpreted this &#8220;first priority&#8221; obligation to include the requirement that PG&#38;E Corporation &#8220;infuse the Utility with all types of capital necessary for the Utility t o fulfill its obligation to serve.&#8221; In addition, before the Utility can pay common stock dividends to PG&#38;E Corporation, the Utility must maintain its authorized capital structure with an average 52% equity component. 
If the Utility were required to pay a material amount of fines or incur material unrecoverable costs in connection with the terms of the probation or monitorship , the pending CPUC investigations, or other enforcement matters, it would require incremental equity contributions from PG&#38;E Corpo ration to restore its capital structure. PG&#38;E Corporation common stock issuances used to fund such equity contributions could materially dilute EPS. (See &#8220;Liquidity and Financial Resources&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A.) Further, if PG&#38;E Corporation were required t o infuse the Utility with significant capital or if the Utility was unable to distribute cash to PG&#38;E Corporation, or both, PG&#38;E Corporation may be unable to pay principal and interest on its outstanding debt, pay its common stock dividend, or meet other o bligations. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to pay dividends also could be affected by financial covenants contained in their respective credit agreements that require each company to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidate d capitalization of at most 65%. 
Risks Related to Operations and Information Technology 
The Utility&#8217;s electricity and natural gas operations are inherently hazardous and involve significant risks which, if they materialize, can adversely affect PG&#38;E Corp oration&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results. The Utility&#8217;s insurance may not be sufficient to cover losses caused by an operatin g failure or catastrophic event, or may not become available at a reasonable cost, or available at all. 
The Utility owns and operates extensive electricity and natural gas facilities, including two nuclear generation units and an extensive hydroelectric generating system . (See &#8220;Electric Utility Operations&#8221; and &#8220;Natural Gas Utility Operations&#8221; in Item 1. Business.) The Util ity&#8217;s ability to earn its authorized ROE depends on its ability to efficiently maintain, operate, and protect its facilities, and provide electricity and natural gas services safely and reliably. The Utility undertakes substantial capital investment proje cts to construct, replace, and improve its electricity and natural gas facilities. In addition, the Utility is obligated to decommission its electricity generation facilities at the end of their useful operating lives. The Utility&#8217;s ability to safely and reliably operate, maintain, construct and decommission its facilities is subject to numerous risks, many of which are beyond the Utility&#8217;s control, including those that arise from: 
the breakdown or failure of equipment, electric transmission or di stribution lines, or natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines, that can cause explosions, fires, or other catastrophic events; 
an overpressure event occurring on natural gas facilities due to equipment failure, incorrect operating procedures or failure to follow correct operating procedures, or welding or fabrication-related defects, that results in the failure of downstream transmission pipelines or distribution assets and uncontained natural gas flow; 
failure to maintain adequate capaci ty to meet customer demand on the gas system that results in customer curtailments, controlled/uncontrolled gas outages, gas surges back into homes, serious personal injury or loss of life; 
a prolonged statewide electrical black-out that results in damage to the Utility&#8217;s equipment or damage to property owned by customers or other third parties; 
the failure to fully identify, evaluate, and control workplace hazards that result in serious injury or loss of life for employees or the public, environm ental damage, or reputational damage; 
the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity, natural disaster, or terrorist act; 
the failure of a large dam or other major hydroelectric facility, or the failure of one or more levees that protect land on which the Utility&#8217;s assets are built; 
the failure to take expeditious or sufficient action to mitigate operating conditions, facilities, or equipment, that the Utility has identified, or reasonably should have identified, as unsafe, which failure then leads to a catastrophic event (such as a wild land fire or natural gas explosion), and the failure to respond effectively to a catastrophic event; 
inadequate emergency preparedness plans and the failure to respo nd effectively to a catastrophic event that can lead to public or employee harm or extended outages; 
severe weather events such as storms, tornadoes, floods, drought, earthquakes, tsunamis, wild land and other fires, pandemics, solar events, electromagnetic events, or other natural disasters; 
operator or other human error;
an ineffective records management program that results in the failure to construct, operate and maintain a utility system safely and prudently;
construction performed by third parties that damage the Utility&#8217;s underground or overhead facilities, including, for example, ground excavations or &#8220;dig-ins&#8221; that damage the Utility&#8217;s underground pipelines; 
the release of hazardous or toxic substances into the air, water, or soil, including, for example, gas leaks from natural gas storage facilities; flaking lead-based paint from the Utility&#8217;s facilities, and leaking or spilled insulating fluid from electrical equipment; and 
attacks by third parties, including cy ber-attacks, acts of terrorism, vandalism, or war. 
The occurrence of any of these events could interrupt fuel supplies; affect demand for electricity or natural gas; cause unplanned outages or reduce generating output; damage the Utility&#8217;s assets or ope rations; damage the assets or operations of third parties on which the Utility relies; damage property owned by customers or others; and cause personal injury or death. As a result, the Utility could incur costs to purchase replacement power, to repair as sets and restore service, and to compensate third parties. 
In particular, the Utility may incur material liability in connection with the Butte fire. ( See &#8220;PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility may incur material liability in connection with Butte Fire&#8221; above. ) &#160; Additionally, on January 12, 2017, a residential structure fire occurred in Yuba City, California resulting in the collapse of the house and injuries to two persons inside the house. The CPUC, a third-party engineering firm, and local fire and police officials are investigating the origin and cause of the incident. The Utility may incur material costs, including as a result of these investigations or any proceedings that could be commenced in connection with this incident. 
Further, although the Utility often enters into agreements for third-party contractors to perform work, such as patrolling and inspection of facilities or the construction or demolition or facilities, the Utility may retain liability for the quali ty and completion of the contractor&#8217;s work and can be subject to penalties or other enforcement action if the contractor violates applicable laws, rules, regulations, or orders. The Utility may also be subject to liability, penalties or other enforcement action as a result of personal injury or death caused by third-party contractor actions. 
Insurance, equipment warranties, or other contractual indemnification requirements may not be sufficient or effective to provide full or even partial recovery under all circumstances or against all hazards or liabilities to which the Utility may become subject. An uninsured loss could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results. Future insurance coverage may not be available at rates and on terms as favorable as the Utility&#8217;s current insurance coverage or may not be available at all. 
Further, California law includes a doctrine of inverse condemnation that is routinely invoked in California for wildfire damages. Inverse condemna tion imposes strict liability (including liability for attorneys&#8217; fees) for damages and takings as a result of the design, construction and maintenance of utility facilities, including its electric transmission lines. As a result of the strict liability s tandard applied to wildfires, recent losses recorded by insurance companies, the risk of increase of wildfires including as a result of the ongoing drought, and the Butte fire, the Utility may not be able to obtain sufficient insurance coverage in the futu re at comparable cost and terms as the Utility&#8217;s current insurance coverage, or at all. In addition, the Utility is unable to predict whether it would be allowed to recover in rates the increased costs of insurance or the costs of any uninsured losses. 
I f the amount of insurance is insufficient or otherwise unavailable, or if the Utility is unable to recover in rates the costs of any uninsured losses, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be m aterially affected. 
The Utility&#8217;s operational and information technology systems could fail to function properly or be improperly accessed or damaged by third parties (including cyber-attacks and physical acts ) or damaged by severe weather, natural disast ers, or other events. Any of these events could disrupt the Utility&#8217;s operations and cause the Utility to incur unanticipated losses and expense or liability to third parties . 
The operation of the Utility&#8217;s extensive electricity and natural gas systems re lies on evolving and increasingly complex operational and information technology systems and network infrastructures that are interconnected with the systems and network infrastructure owned by third parties. &#160; All of the Utility&#8217;s operational and technolog y systems and network infrastructure are vulnerable to disability or failures in the event of cyber-attacks and physical acts. Cyber- attacks are increasingly sophisticated and may include computer hacking, viruses, malware, social engineering, denial of s ervice attacks, ransomware, destructive malware, or other means of disruption, destruction, or unauthorized access, acquisition or control. In addition, hardware, software, or applications the Utility develops or procures from third parties may contain de fects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Physical attacks may include acts of sabotage, acts of war, acts of terrorism, or other physical acts. The Utility&#8217;s operational and information tec hnology systems and networks are deemed critical infrastructure, and any failure or decrease in their functionality could, among other things, cause harm to the public or employees, significantly disrupt operations, negatively impact the Utility&#8217;s ability to generate, transport, deliver and store energy and gas, or otherwise operate in the most efficient manner or at all, undermine the Utility&#8217;s performance of critical business functions, damage the Utility&#8217;s assets or operations or those of third parties, and lead to reputational harm. As a result, such events could subject the Utility to significant expenses, claims by customers or third parties, government inquiries, investigations, and regulatory actions that could result in fines and penalties, and los s of customers, any of which could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations. 
The Utility&#8217;s systems, including its financial information, operational systems, advanced metering, and billin g systems, require ongoing maintenance, modification, and updating, which can be costly and increase the risk of errors and malfunction. &#160; The Utility often relies on third-party vendors to host, maintain, modify, and update its systems and these third-part y vendors could cease to exist , fail to establish adequate processes to protect the Utility&#8217;s systems and information, or experience internal or external security incidents. &#160; Any incidents, disruptions or deficiencies in existing systems, or disruptions, d elays or deficiencies in the modification of existing systems or implementation of new systems could result in increased costs, the inability to track or collect revenues, or diversion of management&#8217;s and employees&#8217; attention and resources, or negatively a ffect the Utility&#8217;s ability to maintain effective financial controls or timely file required regulatory reports. &#160; The Utility also could be subject to patent infringement claims arising from the use of third-party technology by the Utility or by a third-pa rty vendor. 
In addition, the Utility&#8217;s information systems contain confidential information, including information about customers and employees. &#160; A data breach involving theft, improper disclosure, or other unauthorized access to or acquisition of conf idential information could subject the Utility to penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, claims by third parties, and enforcement actions by government agencies. It could also reduce the value of proprietary information, and harm the Utility&#8217; s reputation. 
The Utility and its third party vendors have been subject, and will likely continue to be subject, to attempts to gain unauthorized access to the Utility&#8217;s information technology systems, or confidential data, or to disrupt the Utility&#8217;s op erations. None of these attempts or breaches has individually or in the aggregate resulted in a security incident with a material impact on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations. Despite implementation of secu rity and control measures, there can be no assurance that the Utility will be able to prevent the unauthorized access to its systems, infrastructure, or data, or the disruption of its operations, either of which could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s a nd the Utility&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations. 
While the Utility maintains cyber liability insurance that covers certain damages caused by cyber incidents, there is no guarantee that adequate insurance will continue to be available at r ates the Utility believes are reasonable or that the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident will be covered by insurance or recoverable in rates. 
The operation and decommissioning of the Utility&#8217;s nuclear power plants expose it to pot entially significant liabilities and the Utility may not be able to fully recover its costs if regulatory requirements change or the plant ceases operations before the licenses expire. 
The operation of the Utility&#8217;s nuclear generation facilities exposes it to potentially significant liabilities from environmental, health and financial risks, such as risks relating to the storage, handling and disposal of spent nuclear fuel, and the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic act ivity, natural disaster, or terrorist act. If the Utility incurs losses that are either not covered by insurance or exceed the amount of insurance available, such losses could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial result s. In addition, the Utility may be required under federal law to pay up to $255 million of liabilities arising out of each nuclear incident occurring not only at the Utility&#8217;s Diablo Canyon facility but at any other nuclear power plant in the United State s. &#160; (See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) &#160; &#160; 
On August 11, 2016, the Utility submitted an application to the CPUC to retire Diablo Canyon at the expiration of its current operating licenses in 2024 and 2025 and replace it with a portfolio of energy efficiency and GHG-free resources. The application includes a joint proposal between the Utility and certain interested parties, entered into on June 20, 2016. However, the Utility continues to face public concern about the safety of nuclear generation and nuclear fuel. Some of these nuclear opposition g roups regularly file petitions at the NRC and in other forums challenging the actions of the NRC and urging governmental entities to adopt laws or policies in opposition to nuclear power. Although an action in opposition may ultimately fail, regulatory pr oceedings may take longer to conclude and be more costly to complete. It is also possible that public pressure could grow leading to adverse changes in legislation, regulations, orders, or their interpretation. As a result, operations at the Utility&#8217;s tw o nuclear generation units at Diablo Canyon could cease before the licenses expire in 2024 and 2025. In such an instance, the Utility could be required to record a charge for the remaining amount of its unrecovered investment and such charge could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility&#8217;s financial results. 
In addition, in order to retain highly skilled personnel necessary to safely operate Diablo Canyon during the remaining years of operations, the Utility will incur costs in connecti on with (i) an employee retention program to ensure adequate staffing levels at Diablo Canyon, and (ii) an employee retraining and development program, &#160; to facilitate redeployment of a portion of Diablo Canyon personnel to the decommissioning project and el sewhere in the company. &#160; The Utility currently estimates that the additional cost of the employee retention program and the employee retraining and development program will be approximately $350 million. &#160; The Joint Proposal seeks confirmation from the CPUC that these costs will be recovered through the Utility&#8217;s nuclear decommissioning electric rates. &#160; The employee retention and retraining and development programs are subject to bargaining with the Utility&#8217;s labor unions. &#160; The Utility will also incur costs in connection with an employee severance program. &#160; The severance program was previously approved by the CPUC in prior nuclear decommissioning ratemaking proceedings. 
The Utility has incurred, and may continue to incur, substantial costs to comply with NRC regulations and orders. &#160; (See &#8220;Regulatory Environment&#8221; in Item 1. Business.) &#160; If the Utility were unable to recover these costs, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected. &#160; The Utility may determine that it cannot comply with the new regulations or orders in a feasible and economic manner and voluntarily cease operations; alternatively, the NRC may order the Utility to cease operations until the Utility can comply with new regulations, orders, or decisions. &#160; The Ut ility may incur a material charge if it ceases operations at Diablo Canyon before the licenses expire in 2024 and 2025. At December 31, 2016, the Utility&#8217;s unrecovered investment in Diablo Canyon was $1.7 billion. 
At the state level, the California Wate r Board has adopted a policy on once-through cooling that generally requires the installation of cooling towers or other significant measures to reduce the impact on marine life from existing power generation facilities in California by at least 85%. &#160; If t he California Water Board requires the installation of cooling towers that the Utility believes are not technically or economically feasible, the Utility may be forced to cease operations at Diablo Canyon and may incur a material charge. &#160; If the Utility obt ains contingent approvals referred to herein that will result in retiring Diablo Canyon at the end of the current NRC operating licenses, the Utility will not be required to install cooling towers or implement alternative measures in order to comply with t he California State Water Board Once-Through Cooling Wat er Policy, thus eliminating the regulatory uncertainty regarding the measures that could have been imposed on the Utility or of incurring a material charge related thereto. Even if the Utility is ult imately not required to install cooling towers, under the State Water Board&#8217;s interim mitigation measures applicable to Diablo Canyon&#8217;s operations prior to 2025, starting in 2016, it will be required to make payments to the California Coastal Conservancy t o fund various environmental mitigation projects, that the Utility does not expect to exceed $5 million per year. 
On June 28, 2016 the California State Lands Commission approved an extension of the Utility&#8217;s leases of coastal land occupied by the water intake and discharge structures for the nuclear generation units at Diablo Canyon, to run concurrently with Diablo Canyon&#8217;s current operating licenses. The Utility will be required to obtain an additional lease extension from the State Lands Commission to cover the period of time necessary to decommission the facility. The State Lands Commission and California Coastal Commission will evaluate appropriate environmental mitigation and development conditions associated with the decommissioning project, the c osts of which could be substantial. 
The Utility also has an obligation to decommission its electricity generation facilities, including its nuclear facilities, as well as gas transmission system assets, at the end of their useful lives. &#160; (See Note 2: Sum mary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8211; Asset Retirement Obligations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement in Item 8.) &#160; The CPUC authorizes the Utility to recover its estimated costs to decommission its nuclear facilities through nuclear d ecommissioning charges that are collected from customers and held in nuclear decommissioning trusts to be used for the eventual decommissioning of each nuclear unit. &#160; If the Utility&#8217;s actual decommissioning costs, including the amounts held in the nuclear decommissioning trusts, exceed estimated costs, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected. 
Risks Related to Environmental Factors 
The Utility&#8217;s operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and changes i n or liabilities under these laws could adversely affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results. 
The Utility&#8217;s operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws, regulations, orders, relating to air quality, water quality and usage, remediation of hazardous wastes, and the protection and conservation of natural resources and wildlife. The Utility incurs significant capital, operating, and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental statute s, rules, and regulations. The Utility has been in the past, and may be in the future, required to pay for environmental remediation costs at sites where it is identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws. Alth ough the Utility has recorded liabilities for known environmental obligations, these costs can be difficult to estimate due to uncertainties about the extent of contamination, remediation alternatives, the applicable remediation levels, and the financial a bility of other pote ntially responsible parties. (For more information, s ee Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) 
Environmental remediation costs could increase in the future as a result of new legislation, the curren t trend toward more stringent standards, and stricter and more expansive application of existing environmental regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or failure to comply with the terms of licenses or permits issued by environment al or regulatory agencies, could expose the Utility to claims by third parties or the imposition of civil or criminal fines or other sanctions. 
The CPUC has authorized the Utility to recover its environmental remediation costs for certain sites through various ratemaking mechanisms. One of these mechanisms allows the Utility rate recovery for 90% of its hazardous substance remediation costs for certain approved sites without a reasonableness review. The CPUC may discontinue or change these ratemaking m echanisms in the future or the Utility may incur environmental costs that exceed amounts the CPUC has authorized the Utility to recover in rates. 
Some of the Utility&#8217;s environmental costs, such as the remediation costs associated with the Hinkley natural gas compressor site, are not recoverable through rates or insurance . (See &#8220;Environmental Regulation&#8221; in Item 1.) The Utility&#8217;s costs to remediate groundwater contamination near the Hinkley natural gas compressor site and to abate the effects of the contamination have had, and may continue to have, a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results. Their financial results also can be materially affected by changes in estimated costs and by the extent to which actual remediation costs differ from recorded liabilities. 
The Utility&#8217;s future operations may be affected by climate change that may have a material impact on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
The Utility has been studying the potential effects of climate change (increased temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, rising sea levels) on the Utility &#8217;s operations and is developing contingency plans to adapt to those events and conditions that the Utility believes are most significant. Scientists project that climate change will increase electricity demand due to more extreme, persistent and hot weath er. While snowpack in the Sierra Nevada Mountains has been at higher than normal levels this winter, California has experienced ongoing drought in the past. If temperatures and the levels of precipitation in the Utility&#8217;s service territory continue to ch ange, that could impact the levels of snowpack in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. As a result, the Utility&#8217;s hydroelectric generation could change and the Utility would need to consider managing or acquiring additional generation. &#160; 
If the Utility increases i ts reliance on conventional generation resources to replace hydroelectric generation and to meet increased customer demand, it may become more costly for the Utility to comply with GHG emissions limits. In addition, increasing temperatures and lower level s of precipitation could increase the occurrence of wildfires in the Utility&#8217;s service territory causing damage to the Utility&#8217;s facilities or the facilities of third parties on which the Utility relies to provide service, damage to third parties for loss of property, personal injury, or loss of life. In addition, flooding caused by rising sea levels could damage the Utility&#8217;s facilities, including hydroelectric assets such as dams and canals, and the electric transmission and distribution assets. The Uti lity could incur substantial costs to repair or replace facilities, restore service, compensate customers and other third parties for damages or injuries. The Utility anticipates that the increased costs would be recovered through rates, but as rate press ures increase, the likelihood of disallowance or non-recovery may increase. 
Events or conditions caused by climate change could have a greater impact on the Utility&#8217;s operations than the Utility&#8217;s studies suggest and could result in lower revenues or in creased expenses, or both. If the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility&#8217;s rates to reflect the impact of events or conditions caused by climate change, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be mat erially affected. 
Other Risk Factors
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected as a result of political and legislative developments. 
The Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected as a result of the recent change in federal a dministration from President Barack Obama to Preside nt Donald Trump. For example, the new administration has indicated tax reform as a priority. Tax reform outli nes produced by both President Trum p and the Tax Reform Task Force include proposals related to federal tax rate s , deductions for state income taxes (and potentially property tax), interest expense deduction, capital expenditure deduction, and expensing plant. It is unclear what tax reform may be ultimately adopted. It is generally expected that a tax reform bill will be introduced in early 2017. &#160; 
The Utility may be required to incur substantial costs in order to obtain or renew licenses and permits needed to operate the Utility&#8217;s business and the Utility may be subject to fines and penalties for failure to comply or obtain license renewal. 
The Utility must comply with the terms of various governmental permits, authorizations, and licenses, including those issued by the FERC for the continued operation of the Utility&#8217;s hydroelectric generation facilities, and those issued by environmental and other federal, state and local governmental agencies. Many of the Utility&#8217;s capital investment proj ects, and some maintenance activities, often require the Utility to obtain land use, construction, environmental, or other governmental permits. These permits, authorizations, and licenses may be difficult to obtain on a timely basis, causing work delays. &#160; Further, existing permits and licenses could be revoked or modified by the agencies that granted them if facts develop that differ significantly from the facts assumed when they were issued. In addition, the Utility often seeks periodic renewal of a lic ense or permit, such as a waste discharge permit or a FERC operating license for a hydroelectric generation facility. If a license or permit is not renewed for a particular facility and the Utility is required to cease operations at that facility, the Uti lity could incur an impairment charge or other costs. Before renewing a permit or license, the issuing agency may impose additional requirements that may increase the Utility&#8217;s compliance costs. In particular, in connection with a license renewal for one or more of the Utility&#8217;s hydroelectric generation facilities or assets, the FERC may impose new license conditions that could, among other things, require increased expenditures or result in reduced electricity output and/or capacity at the facility. In addition, local governments may attempt to assert jurisdiction over various utility operations by requiring permits or other approvals that the Utility has not been previously required to obtain. &#160; 
The Utility may incur penalties and sanctions for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of licenses and permits which could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. If the Utility cannot obtain, renew, or comply with nec essary governmental permits, authorizations, licenses, ordinances, or other requirements, or if the Utility cannot recover the increase in associated compliance and other costs in a timely manner, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results coul d be materially affected. 
Poor investment performance or other factors could require PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility to make significant unplanned contributions to its pension plan, other postretirement benefits plans, and nuclear decommissioning trust s. 
PG&#38; E Corporation and the Utility provide defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits for eligible employees and retirees. The Utility also maintains three trusts for the purposes of providing funds to decommission its nuclear facilities. The performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of plan assets and trust assets. A decline in the market value may increase the funding requirements for these plans and trusts. The cost of providing pension and other postretirement bene fits is also affected by other factors, including interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels, the rate of return on plan assets, employee demographics, discount rates used in determining future benefit obligations, rates of increase in health care costs, future government regulation, and prior contributions to the plans. Similarly, funding requirements for the nuclear decommissioning trusts are affected by the rates of return on trust assets, changes in the laws or regulations regar ding nuclear decommissioning or decommissioning funding requirements as well as changes in assumptions or forecasts related to decommissioning dates, technology and the cost of labor, materials and equipment. (See Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) If the Utility is required to make significant unplanned contributions to fund the pension and postretirement plans or if actual nuclear decommissioning costs exceed the amount of nuclear decommissioning trust funds and the Utility is unable to recover the contributions or additional costs in rates, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected . 
The Utility&#8217;s success depends on the availabili ty of the services of a qualified workforce and its ability to maintain satisfactory collective bargaining agreements which cover a substantial number of employees. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s results may suffer if the Utility is unable to attrac t and retain qualified personnel and senior management talent, or if prolonged labor disruptions occur. 
The Utility&#8217;s workforce is aging and many employees are or will become eligible to retire within the next few years. Although the Utility has underta ken efforts to recruit and train new field service personnel, the Utility may be faced with a shortage of experienced and qualified personnel. The majority of the Utility&#8217;s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with three unions. Labo r disruptions could occur depending on the outcome of negotiations to renew the terms of these agreements with the unions or if tentative new agreements are not ratified by their members. In addition, some of the remaining non-represented Utility employee s could join one of these unions in the future. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility also may face challenges in attracting and retaining senior management talent especially if they are unable to restore the reputational harm generated by the negative publi city stemming from the ongoing enforcement proceedings. Any such occurrences could negatively impact PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations.

PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results can be affected by many factors , including estimates and assumptions used in the critical accounting policies described in MD&#38;A, that can cause their actual financial results to differ materially from historical results or from anticipated future financial results . &#160; T he following discussion of key risk factors should be considered in evaluating an investment in PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility and should be read in conjunction with MD&#38;A and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this Form 10-K . Any of these factors , in whole or in part, could materially affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s business, results of operations , financial condition, a nd stock price. 
Risks Related to the Outcome of Enforcement Matters, Investigations, and Regulatory Proceedings 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s future financial results may be materially affected by the outcome of the federal criminal prosecution of the Utility. 
As discussed in MD&#38;A, the Utility is facing federal criminal charges alleging that the Utility knowingly and willfully violated minimum safety standards under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act and alleging t hat the Utility illegally obstructed the NTSB&#8217;s investigation into the cause of the San Bruno accident that occurred on September 9, 2010 . The maximum statutory fine for each felony count is $500,000, for potential total fines of $ 6.5 million. The federal prosecutor also seeks to impose an alternative fine which could total approximately $ 562 m illion , b ased on allegations that the Utility derived gross gains of approximately $281 million . The trial currently is scheduled to begin on March 22 , 2016. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility have not recorded any charges for potential criminal fines in their consolidated f inancial statements at December 31, 2015. If the Utility is convicted and a fine is imposed, PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility will record charges when required in accordance with GAAP. The Utility also could incur material costs, not recoverable through rates, to implement remedial measures that may be imposed by the court, such as a requirement that the Utility&#8217;s natural gas operations be supervised by a third-party monitor . The Utility could also be suspended or debarred from entering into federal procurement and non-procurement contracts and programs. 
If the Utility incurred material fines or costs following a conviction, PG&#38;E Corporation may need to issue common stock to raise funds to contribute to the Utility to maintain the required equity component of the Utility&#8217;s authorized capital structure as the Utility incur charges and costs. These issuances would be incremental to PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s current forecast of common stock issuances and could materially dilute PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s EPS. The trial and any negative publicity associated with it, as well as the Utility&#8217;s conviction and the imposition of a material fine, if incurred, also could affect the Utility&#8217;s and PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s credit ratings or outlooks and make it more difficult for PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility to access the capital markets.
The trial and the Utility&#8217;s conviction could harm the Utility&#8217;s relationships with regulators, legislators, communities, business partners, or other constituencies and make it more difficult to recruit qualified personnel and senior management. Further, they could negatively affect the outcome of future ratemaking and regulatory proceedings ; for example, by enabling parties to challenge the Utility&#8217;s request to recover costs that the parties allege are somehow related to the criminal charges . &#160; 
In addition, the Utility&#8217;s conviction could result in increased regulatory or legislative pressure to require the separation of the Utility&#8217;s electric and natural gas businesses, restructure the corporate relationship between PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility, or undergo some other fundamental corporate restructuring. As discussed under the heading &#8220;Regulatory Matters&#8221; in MD&#38;A, the SED will evaluate PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s organizational structure in the CPUC&#8217;s pending investigation to examine the Utility&#8217;s safety culture. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s future financial results may be materially affected by the outcome s of the CPUC&#8217;s investigative enforcement proceedings against the Utility, other known enforcement matters, and other ongoing state and federal investigations. The Utility also could incur material costs and fines in connection with future investigations, citations, audits, or enforcement actions. 
The Utility could incur material charges, including fines and other penalties, in connection with the CPUC&#8217;s investigation s of the Utility&#8217;s compliance with natural gas distribution record-keeping practices and th e Utility&#8217;s compliance with the CPUC&#8217;s rules regarding ex parte communications . In addition, there are several other investigations by f ederal and state law enforcement authorities . The Utility was informed that the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office was investigating a natural gas explosion that occurred in Carmel, California on March 3, 2014. The U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office in San Francisco also continues to investigate matters relating to the indicted case discussed above. Federal and state law enforcement authorities also have been investigating matters related to allegedly improper communication between the Utility and CPUC personnel. If these investigations result in enforcement action against the Utility, the Utility could incur additional fines or penalties or suffer negative consequences described above in the immediately preceding risk factor . &#160; In addition , a &#160; negative outcome in any of these investigations or future enforcement actions may negatively affe c t the outcom e of fut u re rat e making and regul a to ry proceeding s; for example, by enabling parties to challenge the Utility&#8217;s request to recover costs that the parties allege are somehow related to the Utility&#8217;s violations. 
The SED also could impose material fines on the Utility based on the Utility&#8217;s self-reports submitted in accordance with the SED&#8217;s safety citation program and the Utility&#8217;s efforts to identify and remove encroachments from transmission pipeline rights of way. &#160; The Penalty Decision r equires the SED to review the Utility&#8217;s gas transmission operations (including t he Utility&#8217;s compliance with the remedies ordered by the Penalty Decision) and to perform annual audits of the Utility&#8217;s record-keeping practices for a minimum of ten years. T he SED could impose f ines on the Utility or require the Utility to incur unrecoverable costs, or both, based on the outcome of the se future audits . In addition, although PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility do not currently face the possibility of fines or penalties in the first phase of the CPUC&#8217;s pending investigation into the Utility&#8217;s safety culture since it has been categorized as rate setting, it is uncertain how the next phase will be categorized. (See the discussion under the heading &#8220;Regulatory Matters&#8221; in MD&#38;A.) 
The Utility could be subject to additional regulatory or governmental enforcement action in the future with respect to compliance with federal, state or local laws, regulations or orders that could result in additional fines, penalties or customer refunds, including those regarding renewable energy and resource adequacy requirements; customer billing; customer service; affiliate transactions; vegetation management; design, construction, operating and maintenance practices; safety and inspection practices; and federal electric reliability standards . The SED could impose fines on the Utility in the future in accordance with its authority under the gas and electric safety citation programs. The amount of such fines, penalties, or customer refunds could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results. &#160; 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s future financial results could be materially affected by the extent to which its natural gas transmission costs exceed authorized revenues as the Utility complies with the Penalty Decision a nd incurs other natural gas transmission costs that are unrecoverable or that the Utility has not sought to recover. 
The Utility&#8217;s ability to recover its natural gas transmission and storage costs and earn its authorized ROE could be materially affected by the amount of revenues the CPUC ultimately authorizes the Utility to collect in the 2015 GT&#38;S rate case proceeding and future GT&#38;S rate cases. (See &#8220;R egulatory Matters &#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A.) The Utility continues to incur material unrecoverable costs to meet the Penalty Decision&#8217;s requirement to fund safety-related projects and programs to be identified by the CPUC in the 2015 GT&#38;S rate case. Depending on how the CPUC designates pipeline safety-related projects and programs the Utility is required to fund, and how the Utility&#8217;s associated costs are counted toward meeting the $850 million maximum disallowance imposed by the Penalty Decision , the ultimate amount of unrecoverable pipeline-related costs the Utility incurs may be higher than current forecasts. In addition, the Penalty Decision requires the Utility to implement various remedial measures which the CPUC estimated would cost $50 million. Actual costs to implement the remedies could be higher. 
In addition, the Utility plans to incur unrecoverable costs to continue performing certain work to complete projects under the PSEP and to identify and remove encroachments from gas transmission pipeline rights-of-way. Actual costs to perform this work could exceed forecasts . 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results primarily depend on the outcomes of regulatory and ratemaking proceedings and the Utility&#8217;s ability to manage its operating expenses and capital expenditures so that it is able to earn its authorized rate of return in a timely manner. 
As a regulated entity, the Utility&#8217;s rates are set by the CPUC or the FERC on a prospective basis and are generally designed to allow the Utility to collect sufficient revenues to recover the costs of providing service, including a return on its capital investments. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected if the CPUC or the FERC does not authorize sufficient revenues for the Utility to safely and reliably serve its customers and earn its authorized ROE. &#160; The outcome of the Utility&#8217;s ratemaking proceedings can be affected by many factors, including the Utility&#8217;s reputation (especially if the Utility is convicted of the federal criminal charges discussed above), the level of opposition by intervening parties; potential rate impacts; increasing levels of regulatory review; changes in the political, regulatory, or legislative environments; and the opinions of the Utility&#8217;s regulators, consumer and other stakeholder organizations, and customers, about the Utility&#8217;s ability to provide safe, reliable, and afford able electric and gas services. 
The Utility also is required to incur costs to comply with legislative and regulatory requirements and initiatives, such as those relating to the development of a state-wide electric vehicle charging infrastructure, the deployment of distributed energy resources, implementation of demand response and customer energy efficiency programs, energy storage and renewable energy targets, and the construction of the California high-speed rail project. The Utility&#8217;s ability to recover costs , including its investment s , associated with these and other legislative and regulatory initiatives will, in large part, depend on the final form of legislative or regulatory requirements, and whether the associated ratemaking mechanisms can be timely adjusted to reflect changes in customer demand for the Utility&#8217;s electricity and natural gas service s . &#160; 
In addition to the amount of authorized revenues, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected if the Utility&#8217;s actual costs to safely and reliably serve its customers differ from authorized or forecast costs. The Utility may incur additional costs for many reasons including changing market circumstances, unanticipated events (such as storms, accidents, catastrophic or other events affecting the Utility&#8217;s operations), or compliance with new state laws or policies. Although the Utility may be allowed to recover some or all of the additional costs, there may be a substantial time lag between when the Utility incurs the costs and when the Utility is authorized to collect revenues to recover such costs. Alternatively, the CPUC or the FERC may disallow costs that they determine were not reasonably or prudently incurred by the Utility. 
The Utility&#8217;s ability to recover its costs also may be affected by the economy and its impact on the Utility&#8217;s customers. For example, a sustained downturn or sluggishness in the economy could reduce the Utility&#8217;s sales to industrial and commercial customers or the level of uncollectible bills could increase. Although the Utility generally recovers its costs through rates, regardless of sales volume, rate pressures increase when the costs are borne by a smaller sales base. 
Changes in commodity prices also may have an adverse effect on the Utility&#8217;s ability to timely recover its operating costs and earn its authorized ROE. &#160; Although the Utility generally recovers its electricity and natural gas procurement costs from customers as &#8220;pass-through&#8221; costs, a significant and sustained rise in commodity prices could create overall rate pressures that make it more difficult for the Utility to recover its costs that are not categorized as &#8220;pass-through&#8221; costs. &#160; To relieve some of this upward rate pressure, the CPUC could authorize lower revenues than the Utility requested or disallow full cost recovery. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results depend upon the Utility&#8217;s continuing ability to recover &#8220;pass-through&#8221; costs, including electricity and natural gas procurement costs, from customers in a timely manner. The CPUC may disallow procurement costs for a variety of reasons. In addition, the Utility&#8217;s ability to recover these costs could be affected by the loss of Utility customers and decreased new customer growth , if the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility&#8217;s rates to reflect such events. 
The Utility meets customer demand for electricity from a variety of sources, including electricity generated from the Utility&#8217;s own generation facilities, electricity provided by third parties under power purchase agreements, and purchases on the wholesale electricity market. &#160; The Utility must manage these sources using the commercial and CPUC regulatory principles of &#8220;least cost dispatch&#8221; and prudent administration of power purchase agreements in compliance with its CPUC-approved long-term procurement plan. The CPUC could disallow procurement costs incurred by the Utility if the CPUC determines that the Utility did not comply with these principles or if the Utility did not comply with its procurement plan. 
Further, the contractual prices for electricity under the Utility&#8217;s current or future power purchase agreements could become uneconomic in the future for a variety of reasons, including developments in alternative energy technology, increased self-generation by customers, an increase in distributed generation, and lower customer demand due to adverse economic conditions or the loss of the Utility&#8217;s customers to other retail providers. &#160; In particular, the Utility will incur additional costs to procure renewable energy to meet the higher targets established by California SB 350 that became effective on January 1, 2016. Despite the CPUC &#8217;s current approval of the contracts, the CPUC could disallow contract costs in the future if it determines that the costs are unreasonably above market. 
The Utility&#8217;s ability to recover the costs it incurs in the wholesale electricity market may be affected by the whether the CAISO wholesale electricity market continues to function effectively. Although market mechanisms are designed to limit excessive prices, these market mechanisms could fail, or the related systems and software on which the market mechanisms rely may not perform as intended which could result in excessive market prices. &#160; The CPUC could prohibit the Utility from passing through the higher costs of electricity to customers. For example, during the 2000 and 2001 energy crisis, the market mechanism flaws in California&#8217;s then-newly established wholesale electricity market led to dramatically high market prices for electricity that the Utility was unable to recover through customer rates, ultimately causing the Utility to file a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
Further, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be affected by the loss of Utility customers and decreased new customer growth that occurs through municipalization of the Utility&#8217;s facilities, an increase in the number of CCAs who provide electricity to their residents, and an increase in the number of consumers who become direct access customers of alternative generation providers. (See &#8220;Competition in the Electric ity Industry&#8221; in Item 1.) As the number of bundled customers (i.e., those primarily residential customers who receive electricity and distribution service from the Utility) declines, the rates for remaining customers could increase as the Utility would have a smaller customer base from which to recover certain procurement costs. Although the Utility is permitted to collect non-bypassable charges for generation-related costs incurred on behalf of former customers, the charges may not be sufficient for the Utility to fully recover the se costs. In addition, the Utility&#8217;s ability to collect non-bypassable charges has been, and may continue to be, challenged by certain customer groups. Furthermore, if the former customers return to receiving electricity supply from the Utility, the Utility could incur costs to meet their electricity needs that it may not be able to timely recover through rates or that it may not be able to recover at all. 
In addition, increasing levels of self-generation of electricity by customers (primarily solar installations) and the use of customer net energy metering (&#8220;NEM&#8221;), which allows self-generating customers to receive bill credits for surplus power at the full retail rate, puts upward rate pressure on remaining customers. &#160; In January 2016, the CPUC adopted new NEM rules and rates. &#160; The new rules and rates are expected t o become effective for new NEM customers of the Utility later in 2016. &#160; New NEM customers will be required to pay an interconnection fee, will go on time of use rates, and will be required to pay some non-bypassable charges to help fund some of the costs of low income, energy efficiency, and other programs that other customers pay. &#160; However, the resulting rules will still put upward rate pressure on remaining customers, and remove the cap on the number of NEM customers. &#160; Significantly higher rates for remaining customers may result in a decline of the number of such customers as they may seek alternative energy providers. The CPUC states that it intends to revisit these rules in 2019. 
A confluence of technology-related cost declines and sustained federal or state subsidies could make a combination of distributed generation and energy storage a viable, cost-effective alternative to the Utility&#8217;s bundled electric service which could further threaten the Utility&#8217;s ability to recover its generation, transmission, and distribution investments. If the number of the Utility&#8217;s customers decreases or grows at a slower rate than anticipated, the Utility&#8217;s level of capital investment would likely decline as well, in turn leading to a slower growth in rate base and earnings. Reduced energy demand or significantly slowed growth in demand due to customer migration to other energy providers, adoption of energy efficient technology, conservation, increasing levels of distributed generation and self-generation, unless substantially offset through regulatory cost allocations, could adversely impact PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results. 
The CPUC has begun to implement rate reform to allow residential electric rates to more closely reflect the utilities&#8217; actual costs of providing service and decrease cost-subsidization among customer classes. Many aspects of rate reform are not yet finalized, including time-of-use rates and whether the utilities can impose a fixed charge on certain customers. I f the Utility is unable to recover a material portion of its procurement costs and/or if the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility&#8217;s rates to reflect the impact of changing loads, the wide deployment of distributed generation, and the development of new electricity generation and energy storage technologies , PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected . &#160; 
Risks Related to Liquidity and Capital Requirements
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results will be affected by their ability to continue accessing the capital markets and by the terms of debt and equity financings. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility will continue to seek funds in the capital and credit markets to enable the Utility to make capital investments, pay fines that may be imposed in the future, and incur costs to meet the Penalty Decision&#8217;s requirement to incur costs of up to $850 million for safety-related projects and programs to be identified by the CPUC in the 2015 GT&#38;S rate case. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to access the capital and credit markets and the costs and terms of available financing depend primarily on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s credit ratings and outlook. &#160; Their credit ratings and outlook can be affected by man y factors, including the outcome s of the on-going criminal prosecution, the pending CPUC investigations, and ratemaking proceedings. If PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s or the Utility&#8217;s credit ratings were downgraded to below investment grade, their ability to access the capital and credit markets would be negatively affected and could result in higher borrowing costs, fewer financing options, including reduced , or lack of, access to the commercial paper market, additional collateral posting requirements, which in turn could affect liquidity and lead to an increased financing need. Other factors can affect the availability and terms of debt and equity financing, including changes in the federal or state regulatory environment affecting energy companies generally or PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility in particular, the overall health of the energy industry, volatility in electricity or natural gas prices, an increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve Bank, and general economic and financial market conditions. 
The reputations of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility continue to suffer from the negative publicity about matters discussed under &#8220;Enforcement and Litigation Matters&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A. &#160; The negative publicity and the uncertainty about the outcomes of these matters may undermine investors&#8217; confidence in management&#8217;s ability to execute its business strategy and restore a constructive regulatory environment. As a result, investors may be less willing to buy shares of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock resulting in a lower stock price. Further, the market price of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock could decline materially after the outcomes are determined. The amount and timing of future share issuances also could affect the stock price. 
If the Utility were unable to access the capital markets, it could be required to decrease or suspend dividends to PG&#38;E Corporation and PG&#38;E Corporation could be required to contribute capital to the Utility to enable the Utility to fulfill its obligation to serve. To maintain PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s dividend level in these circumstances, PG&#38;E Corporation would be further required to access the capital or credit markets. PG&#38;E Corporation may need to decrease or discontinue its common stock dividend if it is unable to access the capital or credit markets on reasonable terms. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s ability to meet its debt service and other financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the Utility&#8217;s earnings and cash flows. 
PG&#38;E Corporation is a holding company with no revenue generating operations of its own. The Utility must use its resources to satisfy its own obligations, including its obligation to serve customers, to pay principal and interest on outstanding debt, to pay preferred stock dividends, and meet its obligations to employees and creditors, before it can distribute cash to PG&#38;E Corporation. Under the CPUC&#8217;s rules applicable to utility holding companies, the Utility&#8217;s dividend policy must be established by the Utility's Board of Directors as though the Utility were a stand-alone utility company and PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s Board of Directors give &#8220;first priority&#8221; to the Utility&#8217;s capital requirements, as determined to be necessary and prudent to meet the Utility&#8217;s obligation to serve or to operate the Utility in a prudent and efficient manner. The CPUC has interpreted this &#8220;first priority&#8221; obligation to include the requirement that PG&#38;E Corporation &#8220;infuse the Utility with all types of capital necessary for the Utility to fulfill its obligation to serve.&#8221; I n addition, before the Utility can pay common stock dividends to PG&#38;E Corporation, the Utility must maintain its authorized capital structure with an average 52% equity component. 
If the Utility were required to pay a material amount of fines or incur material unrecoverable costs due to a conviction in the on-going criminal prosecution, the pending CPUC investigations , or other enforcement matters , it would require equity contributions from PG&#38;E Corporation to restore its capital structure. PG&#38;E Corporation common stock issuances used to fund such equity contributions could materially dilute EPS . (See &#8220;Liquidity and Financial Resources&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A.) Further, if PG&#38;E Corporation were required to infuse the Utility with significant capital or if the Utility was unable to distribute cash to PG&#38;E Corporation, or both, PG&#38;E Corporation may be unable to pay principal and interest on its outstanding debt, pay its common stock dividend , or meet other obligations. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to pay dividends also could be affected by financial covenants contained in their respective credit agreements that require each company to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ca pitalization of at most 65%. 
Risks Related to Operations and Information Technology
The Utility&#8217;s electricity and natural gas operations are inherently hazardous and involve significant risks which, if they materialize, can adversely affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results . T he Utility&#8217;s insurance may not be sufficient to cover losses caused by an operating failure or catastrophic event. 
The Utility owns and operates extensive electricity and natural gas facilities, including two nuclear generation units and an extensive hydroelectric generating system . (See &#8220; Electric Utility Operations &#8221; and &#8220; Natural Gas Utility Operations &#8221; in Item 1. Business.) The Utility&#8217;s ability to earn its authorized ROE depends on its ability to efficiently maintain, operate, and protect its facilities, and provide electricity and natural gas services safely and reliably. The Utility undertakes substantial capital investment projects to construct, replace, and improve its electricity and natural gas facilities. In addition, the Utility is obligated to decommission its electricity generation facilities at the end of their useful operating lives. The Utility&#8217;s ability to safely and reliably operate, maintain, construct and decommission its facilities is subject to numerous risks, many of which are beyond the Utility&#8217;s control, including those that arise from: 
the breakdown or failure of equipment, electric transmission or distribution lines, or natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines, that can cause explosions, fires, or other catastrophic events;
an overpressure event occurring on natural gas facilities due to e quipment f ailure , i ncorrect o peratin g procedures or failure to follow correct operating procedure s , or we lding or f abrication- r elated d efect s, that results in the failure of downstream transmi ssion pipelines or distribution assets and uncontained natural gas flow; 
f ailure to maintain adequate capacity to meet customer demand on the gas system that result s in customer curtailments, controlled/uncontrolled gas outages, gas surges back into homes, serious personal injury or loss of life; 
a prolonged statewide electrical black-out that result s in damage to the Utility&#8217;s equipment or damage to property owned by customers or other third parties; 
the failure to fully identify, evaluate, and control workplace hazards that result in serious injury or loss of life for employees or the public, environment al damage , or reputational damage; 
the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity, natural disaster, or terrorist act ; 
the failure of a large dam or other major hydroelectric facility, or the failure of one or more levees that protect land on which the Utility&#8217;s assets are built;
the failure to take expeditious or sufficient action to mitigate operating conditions, facilities, or equipment, that the Utility has identified, or reasonably should have identified, as unsafe, which failure then leads to a catastrophic event (such as a wild land fire or natural gas explosion) , and the failure to respond effectively to a catastrophic event; 
inadequate emergency preparedness plans and the failure to r espo nd effectively to a catastrophic event that can lead to public or employee harm or exte nded outages; 
severe weather events such as storms, tornadoes, floods, drought, earthquakes, tsunamis, wild land and other fires, pandemics, solar events, electromagnetic events, or other natural disasters;
operator or other human error;
an ineffective records management program that results in the failure to construct, operate and maintain a utility system safely and prudent ly; 
construc tion performed by third parties that damage the Utility&#8217;s underground or overhead facilities , including, for example, ground excavations or &#8220;dig-ins&#8221; that damage the Utility&#8217;s underground pipelines ; 
the release of hazardous or toxic substances into the air, water , or soil, including, for example, gas leaks from natural gas storage facilities ; flaking lead paint from the Utility's facilities, and leaking or spilled insulating fluid from electrical equipment; and 
attacks by third parties, including cyber-attacks , acts of terrorism, vandalism, or war . 
The occurrence of any of these events could interrupt fuel supplies; affect demand for electricity or natural gas; cause unplanned outages or reduce generating output; damage the Utility&#8217;s assets or operations; damage the assets or operations of third parties on which the Utility relies; damage property owned by customers or others; and cause personal injury or death. As a result, the Utility could incur costs to purchase replacement power, to repair assets and restore service, and to compensate third parties . In particula r, the Utility may incur material liability in connection with a wildfire (known as the &#8220;Butte fire&#8221;) that ignited and spread in Amador and Calaveras c ounties i n Northern California in September 2015 depending on the outcome of the investigations into the cause of the fire . If insurance recoveries are unavailable or insufficient to cover such costs , PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition or results of operations could be materially affected. The Utility also could incur material fines, penalties or disallowances , as a result of enforcement actions taken by the CPUC or other law enforcement agencies . 
Further, although the Utility often enters into agreements for third-party contractors to perform work, such as patrolling and inspection of facilities or the construction or demolition or facilities, the Utility may retain liability for the quality and completion of the contractor&#8217;s work and can be subject to penalties or other enforcement action if the contractor violates applicable laws, rules, regulations, or orders. The Utility may also be subject to liability, penalties or other enforcement action as a result of personal injury or death caused by third-party contractor actions. Insurance, equipment warranties, or other contractual indemnification requirements may not be sufficient or effective to provide full or even partial recovery under all circumstances or against all hazards or liabilities to which the Utility may become subject. An uninsured loss could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results. Future insurance coverage may not be available at rates and on terms as favorable as the Utility&#8217;s current insurance coverage or may not be available at all. 
The Utility&#8217;s operational and information technology systems could fail to function properly or be damaged by third parties (including cyber-attacks and acts of terrorism), severe weather, natural disasters, or other events. Any of these events could disrupt the Utility&#8217;s operations and cause the Utility to incur unanticipated losses and expense or liability to third parties. 
The operation of the Utility&#8217;s extensive electricity and natural gas systems rel ies on evolving and increasingly complex operational and information technology systems and network infrastructures that are interconnected with the systems and network infrastructure owned by third parties. The Utility&#8217;s business is highly dependent on its ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number of tasks and transactions . Despite implementation of security measures, all of the Utility&#8217;s technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism and other causes. The failure of the Utility&#8217;s operational and information technology systems and networks could significantly disrupt operations; cause harm to the public or employees; result in outages or reduced generating output; damage the Utility&#8217;s assets or operations or those of third parties; and subject the Utility to claims by customers or third parties, any of which could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results. 
The Utility&#8217;s systems, including its financial information, operational systems, advanced metering, and billing systems, require ongoing maintenance, modification, and updating, which can be costly and increase the risk of errors and malfunction. &#160; The Utility often relies on third-party vendors to maintain, modify, and update its systems and these third-party vendors could cease to exist. Any disruptions or deficiencies in existing systems, or disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the modification or implementation of new systems, could result in increased costs, the inability to track or collect revenues, the diversion of management&#8217;s and employees&#8217; attention and resources, and could negatively affect the Utility&#8217;s ability to maintain effective financial control s , and/or the Utility&#8217;s ability to timely file required regulatory reports. &#160; The Utility also could be subject to patent infringement claims arising from the use of third-party technology by the Utility or by a third-party vendor. 
In addition, the Utility&#8217;s information systems contain confidential information, including information about customers and employees. The theft, damage, or improper disclosure of confidential information can subject the Utility to penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, subject the Utility to claims from third parties, reduce the value of proprietary information, and harm the Utility&#8217;s reputation.
The operation and decommissioning of the Utility&#8217;s nuclear power plants expose it to potentially significant liabilities and the Utility may not be able to fully recover its costs if regulatory requirements change or the plant ceases operations before the licenses expire . 
The operation of the Utility&#8217;s nuclear generation facilities exposes it to potentially significant liabilities from environmental, health and financial risks, such as risks relating to the storage, handling and disposal of spent nuclear fuel, and the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity, natural disaster, or terrorist act. &#160; If the Utility incurs losses that are either not covered by insurance or exceed the amount of insurance available, such losses could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results. &#160; In addition, the Utility may be required under federal law to pay up to $255 million of liabilities arising out of each nuclear incident occurring not only at the Utility&#8217;s Diablo Canyon facility but at any other nuclear power plant in the United States. &#160; (See Note 1 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) &#160; &#160; 
In addition, the Utility continues to face public concern about the safety of nuclear generation and nuclear fuel. &#160; Some of these nuclear opposition groups regularly file petitions at the NRC and in other forums challenging the actions of the NRC and urging governmental entities to adopt laws or policies in opposition to nuclear power . &#160; Although an action in opposition may ultimately fail, regulatory proceedings may take longer to conclude and be more costly to complete. &#160; It is also possible that public pressure could grow leading to adverse changes in legislation, regulations, orders, or their interpretation . As a result, operations at the Utility&#8217;s two nuclear generation units at Diablo Canyon could cease before the licenses expire in 2024 and 2025 . &#160; In such an instance, the Utility could be required to record a charge for the remaining amount of its unrecovered investment and such charge could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility&#8217;s financial result s. 
The Utility has incurred, and may continue to incur, substantial costs to comply with NRC regulations and orders. &#160; (See &#8220;Regulatory Environment&#8221; in Item 1. Business.) &#160; If the Utility were unable to recover these costs, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected. &#160; The Utility may determine that it cannot comply with the new regulations or orders in a feasible and economic manner and voluntarily cease operations; alternatively, the NRC may order the Utility to cease operations until the Utility can comply with new regulations, orders, or decisions. &#160; T he Utility may incur a material charge if it ceases operations at Diablo Canyon before the licenses expire in 2024 and 2025 . &#160; At December 31, 2015, the Utility&#8217;s unrecovered investment in Diablo Canyon was $2.3 billion. 
A t the state level, the California Water Board has adopted a policy on once-through cooling that generally requires the installation of cooling towers or other significant measures to reduce the impact on marine life from existing power generation facilities in California by at least 85%. &#160; If the California Water Board requires the installation of cooling towers that the Utility believes are not technically or economically feasible, the Utility may be forced to cease operations at Diablo Canyon and may incur a material charge. &#160; Even if the Utility is not required to install cooling towers, it could incur significant costs to comply with alternative compliances measures or to make payments to support various environmental mitigation projects. &#160; 
Further, the Utility&#8217;s leases of coastal land occupied by the water intake and discharge structures for the nuclear generation units at Diablo Canyon expire in 2018 and 2019. The Utility has requested that the California State Lands Commission renew the leases until 2024 and 2025 when the NRC licenses expire. The C alifornia State Lands Commission has deferred acting on the application until later in 2016. It is uncertain what level of environmental review, if any, will be required before the leases can be extended. If the leases are not extended or if the Utility determines that it cannot comply with any new environmental conditions in a feasible and economic manner , then operations at Diablo Canyon would cease and the Utility could incur a material charge for the remaining amount of its unrecovered investment. &#160; 
The Utility also has an obligation to decommission its electricity generation facilities, including its nuclear facilities, as well as gas transmission system assets, at the end of their useful lives. &#160; (See Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8211; Asset Retirement Obligations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement in Item 8.) &#160; The CPUC authorizes the Utility to recover its estimated costs to decommission its nuclear facilities through nuclear decommissioning charges that are collected from customers and held in nuclear decommissioning trusts to be used for the eventual decommissioning of each nuclear unit. &#160; If the Utility&#8217;s actual decommissioning costs, including the amounts held in the nuclear decommissioning trusts, exceed estimated costs, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected. 
Risks Related to Environmental Factors
The Utility&#8217;s operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and changes in or liabilities under these laws could adversely affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results.
The Utility&#8217;s operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws, regulations, orders, relating to air quality, water quality and usage, remediation of hazardous wastes, and the protection and conservation of natural resources and wildlife. The Utility incurs significant capital, operating, and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental statutes, rules, and regulations. The Utility has been in the past , and may be in the future , required to pay for environmental remediation costs at sites where it is identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws. Although the Utility has recorded liabilities for known environmental obligations, these costs can be difficult to estimate due to uncertainties about the extent of contamination, remediation alternatives, the applicable remediation levels, and the financial ability of other potentially responsible parties. (See Note 1 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for more information.) 
Environmental remediation costs could increase in the future as a result of new legislation, the current trend toward more stringent standards, and stricter and more expansive application of existing environmental regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or failure to comply with the terms of licenses or permits issued by environmental or regulatory agencies, could expose the Utility to claims by third parties or the imposition of civil or criminal fines or other sanctions. 
The CPUC has authorized the Utility to recover its environmental remediation costs for certain sites through various ratemaking mechanisms. One of these mechanisms allows the Utility rate recovery for 90% of its hazardous substance remediation costs for certain approved sites without a reasonableness review. The CPUC may discontinue or change these ratemaking mechanisms in the future or the Utility may incur environmental costs that exceed amounts the CPUC has authorized the Utility to recover in rates. 
Some of the Utility&#8217;s environmental costs, such as the remediation costs associated with the Hinkley natural gas compressor site, are not recoverable through rates or insurance . (See &#8220;Environmental Regulation&#8221; in Item 1.) The Utility&#8217;s costs to remediate groundwater contamination near the Hinkley natural gas compressor site and to abate the effects of the contamination have had, and may continue to have, a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results. Their financial results also can be materially affected by changes in estimated costs and by the extent to which actual remediation costs differ from recorded liabilities. 
The Utility&#8217;s future operations may be affected by climate change that may have a material impact on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
The Utility has been studying the potential effects of climate change (increased temperatures, changing precipitation patterns , rising sea levels) on the Utility&#8217;s operations and is developing contingency plans to adapt to those events and conditions that the Utility believes are most significant. Scientists project that climate change will increase electricity demand due to more extreme, persistent and hot weather. Increasing temperatu res and changing levels of precipitation in the Utility&#8217;s service territory would reduce snowpack in the Sierra Mountains. If the levels of snowpack were reduced, the Utility&#8217;s hydroelectric generation would decrease and the Utility would need to acquire additional generation from other sources at a greater cost. &#160; If the Utility increase s its reliance on conventional generation resources to replace hydroelectric generation and to meet increased customer demand, it may become more costly for the Utility to comply with GHG emissions limits. In addition, increasing temperatures and lower levels of precipitation could increase the occurrence of wildfires in the Utility&#8217;s service territory causing damage to the Utility&#8217;s facilities or the facilities of third parties on which the Utility relies to provide service , damage to third parties for loss of property, personal injury, or loss of life . In addition, flooding caused by rising sea levels could damage the Utility&#8217;s facilities, including hydroelectric assets such as dams and canals, and the electric transmission and distribution assets. The Utility could incur substantial costs to repair or replace facilities, restore service, compensate customers and other third parties for damages or injuries. The Utility anticipates that the increased costs would be recovered through rates, but as rate pressures increase, the likelihood of disallowance or non-recovery may increase. 
Events or conditions caused by climate change could have a greater impact on the Utility&#8217;s operations than the Utility&#8217;s studies suggest and could result in lower revenues or increased expenses, or both. If the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility&#8217;s rates to reflect the impact of events or conditions caused by climate change, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially affected.
Other Risk Factors
The Utility may be required to incur substantial costs in order to obtain or renew licenses and permits needed to operate the Utility&#8217;s business and the Utility may be subject to fines and penalties for failure to comply or obtain license renewal. 
The Utility must comply with the terms of various governmental permits, authorizations, and licenses, including those issued by the FERC for the continued operation of the Utility&#8217;s hydroelectric generation facilities, and those issued by environmental and other federal, state and local governmental agencies. Many of the Utility&#8217;s capital investment projects, and some maintenance activities, often require the Utility to obtain land use, construction, environmental, or other governmental permits. These permits, authorizations, and licenses may be difficult to obtain on a timely basis, causing work delays. Further, existing permits and licenses could be revoked or modified by the agencies that granted them if facts develop that differ significantly from the facts assumed when they were issued. In addition, the Utility often seeks periodic renewal of a license or permit, such as a waste discharge permit or a FERC operating license for a hydroelectric generation facility. If a license or permit is not renewed for a particular facility and the Utility is required to cease operations at that facility, the Utility could incur an impairment charge or other costs. Before renewing a permit or license, the issuing agency may impose additional requirements that may increase the Utility&#8217;s compliance costs. In particular, in connection with a license renewal for one or more of the Utility&#8217;s hydroelectric generation facilities or assets, the FERC may impose new license conditions that could, among other things, require increased expenditures or result in reduced electricity output and/or capacity at the facility. In addition, local governments may attempt to assert jurisdiction over various utility operations by requiring permits or other approvals that the Utility has not been previously required to obtain. &#160; 
The Utility may incur penalties and sanctions for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of licenses and permits which could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. If the Utility cannot obtain, renew, or comply with necessary governmental permits, authorizations, licenses, ordinances, or other requirements, or if the Utility cannot recover the increase in associated compliance and other costs in a timely manner, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected. 
Poor investment performance or other factors could require PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility to make significant unplanned contributions to its pension plan, other postretirement benefits plans, and nuclear decommissioning trusts. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility provide defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits for eligible employees and retirees. The Utility also maintains three trusts for the purposes of providing funds to decommission its nuclear facilities. The performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of plan assets and trust assets. A decline in the market value may increase the funding requirements for these plans and trusts. The cost of providing pension and other postretirement benefits is also affected by other factors, including interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels, the rate of return on plan assets, employee demographics, discount rates used in determining future benefit obligations, rates of increase in health care costs, future government regulation, and prior contributions to the plans. Similarly, funding requirements for the nuclear decommissioning trusts are affected by the rates of return on trust assets, changes in the laws or regulations regarding nuclear decommissioning or decommissioning funding requirements as well as changes in assumptions or forecasts related to decommissioning dates, technology and the cost of labor, materials and equipment. (See Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) If the Utility is required to make significant unplanned contributions to fund the pension and postretirement plans or if actual nuclear decommissioning costs exceed the amount of nuclear decommissioning trust funds and the Utility is unable to recover the contributions or additional costs in rates, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected . 
The Utility&#8217;s success depends on the availability of the services of a qualified workforce and its ability to maintain satisfactory collective bargaining agreements which cover a substantial number of employees. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s results may suffer if the Utility is unable to attract and retain qualified personnel and senior management talent, or if prolonged labor disruptions occur. 
The Utility&#8217;s workforce is aging and many employees are or will become eligible to retire within the next few years. Although the Utility has undertaken efforts to recruit and train new field service personnel, the Utility may be faced with a shortage of experienced and qualified personnel. The majority of the Utility&#8217;s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with three unions. Labor disruptions could occur depending on the outcome of negotiations to renew the terms of these agreements with the unions or if tentative new agreements are not ratified by their members . In addition, some of the remaining non-represented Utility employees could join one of these unions in the future. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility also may face challenges in attracting and retaining senior management talent especially if they are unable to restore the reputational harm generated by the negative publicity stemming from the ongoing enforcement proceedings. Any such occurrences could negatively impact PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations.

PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual results and are often beyond their control. (Also see Cautionary Language Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in Item 7. MD&#38;A.) In addition to other disclosures within this Form 10-K, including MD&#38;A in Item 7 and Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and other documents filed with the SEC from time to time, the following key risk factors should be considered in evaluating an investment in PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility. Such factors could affect actual results of operations and cause results to differ substantially from historical results or from results that are currently sought. 
Risks Related &#160; to the Outcome of Enforcement Matters, Investigations, and Regulatory Proceedings 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected by the outcomes of the CPUC investigative enforcement proceedings pending against the Utility, the federal criminal prosecution of the Utility, and the investigations and other potential enforcement matters discussed in Item 7. MD&#38;A. 
In September 2014, the CPUC ALJs overseeing the three investigative enforcement proceedings against the Utility issued a decision to impose total penalties of $1.4 billion on the Utility based on their findings that the Utility committed approximately 3,700 violations of natural gas regulations. The Utility and other parties have appealed these decisions. (See &#8220;Enforcement and Litigation Matters &#8211; Pending CPUC Investigations&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A.) The CPUC could issue a final decision that imposes a materially higher amount of penalties. The impact on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s consolidated financial statements will vary depending on the forms and amounts of penalties imposed. 
Further, if the Utility is convicted of the pending federal criminal charges, the Utility could be required to pay a material amount of fines. Based on the superseding indictment&#8217;s allegations, the maximum alternative fine would be approximately $1.13 billion. (See &#8220;Enforcement and Litigation Matters &#8211; Federal Criminal Indictment&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A.) The Utility also could incur a material amount of costs to comply with remedial measures that the CPUC or a federal judge may impose on the Utility, such as a requirement that the Utility&#8217;s natural gas operations be supervised by a third-party monitor. 
The CPUC could impose penalties or take other enforcement action with respect to communications that may have violated the CPUC&#8217;s rules regarding ex parte communications (See &#8220;Enforcement and Litigation Matters &#8211; Improper CPUC Communications&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A.) In response to the Utility&#8217;s violations of the CPUC&#8217;s rules regarding ex parte communications relating to the 2015 GT&#38;S rate case, the CPUC issued a decision to disallow up to the entire amount of incremental revenues that would have been collected from ratepayers over the five-month period between March 2015 and August 2015. The exact amount of the revenue disallowance will be determined in the CPUC&#8217;s final decision in the 2015 GT&#38;S rate case. See &#8220;Ratemaking and Other Regulatory Proceedings &#8211; 2015 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A. Federal and state law enforcement authorities have begun investigations in connection with these matters and they could take enforcement action in the future. The Utility could be subject to additional penalties or reputational harm if it fails to comply with the restrictions on communications between the Utility and the CPUC imposed by the CPUC in November 2014. 
In addition, the Utility could incur material charges, including fines and other penalties, in connection with the new CPUC investigation of the Utility&#8217;s compliance with natural gas distribution record-keeping practices, the self-reports the Utility has submitted to the CPUC in accordance with the SED&#8217;s gas safety citation program, the SED&#8217;s audit findings, the other matters discussed in &#8220;Enforcement and Litigation Matters&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A, and other self-reports the Utility may file under the gas safety program or under the new electric safety program. 
The Utility could be subject to additional regulatory or governmental enforcement action with respect to compliance with federal, state or local laws, regulations or orders that could result in additional fines, penalties or customer refunds, including those regarding renewable energy and resource adequacy requirements; customer billing; customer service; affiliate transactions; vegetation management; design, construction, operating and maintenance practices; safety and inspection practices; and federal electric reliability standards. The amount of such fines, penalties, or customer refunds could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results depend upon the amount of revenues the Utility is authorized to collect through rates and the Utility&#8217;s ability to manage its operating expenses so that it is able to earn its authorized rate of return in a timely manner. 
As a regulated entity, the Utility&#8217;s rates are set by the CPUC or the FERC on a prospective basis and are generally designed to allow the Utility to collect sufficient revenues to recover the costs of providing service, including a return on and of its capital investments. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected if the CPUC or the FERC does not authorize sufficient revenues for the Utility to safely and reliably serve its customers and earn its authorized ROE. The outcome of the Utility&#8217;s ratemaking proceedings can be affected by many factors, including the level of opposition by intervening parties; general economic conditions and potential rate impacts; increasing levels of regulatory review; changes in the political, regulatory, or legislative environments; and the opinions of the Utility&#8217;s regulators, consumer and other stakeholder organizations, and customers, about the Utility&#8217;s ability to provide safe, reliable, and affordable electric and gas services. As the Utility&#8217;s reputation continues to suffer from the negative media coverage of the ongoing enforcement proceedings, the risk of adverse regulatory outcomes may increase. In addition, the restrictions on communications between the Utility and the CPUC imposed by the CPUC in November 2014 prevent the Utility from fully participating in the regulatory process, which, in turn may affect regulatory outcomes. The Utility&#8217;s relationship with the CPUC also may be negatively affected depending on what, if any, future action may be taken, or negative media coverage that may be generated, in response to the release of approximately 65,000 emails between the Utility and the CPUC to the CPUC and the City of San Bruno. 
In addition to the amount of authorized revenues, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected if the Utility&#8217;s actual costs to safely and reliably serve its customers differ from authorized or forecast costs. The Utility may incur additional costs for many reasons including changing market circumstances, unanticipated events (such as storms, accidents, catastrophic or other events affecting the Utility&#8217;s operations), or compliance with new state laws or policies. Although the Utility may be allowed to recover some or all of the additional costs, there may be a substantial time lag between when the Utility incurs the costs and when the Utility is authorized to collect revenues to recover such costs. Alternatively, the CPUC or the FERC may disallow costs that they determine were not reasonably or prudently incurred by the Utility. 
The Utility&#8217;s ability to recover its costs also may be affected by the economy and the economy&#8217;s corresponding impact on the Utility&#8217;s customers. For example, a sustained downturn or sluggishness in the economy could reduce the Utility&#8217;s sales to industrial and commercial customers or the level of uncollectible bills could increase. Although the Utility generally recovers its costs through rates, regardless of sales volume, rate pressures increase when the costs are borne by a smaller sales base. 
Changes in commodity prices also may have an adverse effect on the Utility&#8217;s ability to timely recover its operating costs and earn its authorized ROE. Although the Utility generally recovers its electricity and natural gas procurement costs from customers as &#8220;pass-through&#8221; costs, a significant and sustained rise in commodity prices could create overall rate pressures that make it more difficult for the Utility to recover its costs that are not categorized as &#8220;pass-through&#8221; costs. To relieve some of this upward rate pressure, the CPUC could authorize lower revenues than the Utility requested or disallow full cost recovery. Further, should the deployment of new electricity generation and energy storage technologies spread and become more cost-effective, the Utility&#8217;s ability to recover its investments and earn its authorized ROE could be adversely affected unless rates are appropriately adjusted. Also, a confluence of technology-related cost declines and sustained federal or state subsidies could make a combination of distributed generation and energy storage a viable, cost-effective alternative to the Utility&#8217;s bundled electric service, which could further threaten the Utility&#8217;s ability to recover its generation, transmission, and distribution investments. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s future financial results could be materially affected by the extent to which its natural gas transmission costs exceed authorized revenues and whether the Utility is able to continue using regulatory accounting for its natural gas transmission business. 
The Utility&#8217;s ability to recover its natural gas transmission and storage costs in 2015, 2016, and 2017 and earn its authorized ROE will be materially affected by the amount of revenues the CPUC ultimately authorizes the Utility to collect in the 2015 GT&#38;S rate case proceeding. (See &#8220;Ratemaking and Other Regulatory Proceedings&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A.) In addition, the Utility plans to perform certain work during 2015 through 2017, including work to complete projects under the PSEP and to identify and remove encroachments from gas transmission pipeline rights-of-way. The Utility has not sought to recover the costs it incurs to perform this work. Actual costs to perform this work could materially exceed forecasts and negatively affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s results of operations. The Utility expects that it will continue to incur costs to respond to public opposition to the Utility&#8217;s work to remove trees and other encroachments. The media attention to the Utility&#8217;s encroachment work also may negatively affect the Utility&#8217;s reputation. 
If rates in the 2015 GT&#38;S rate case and future rate cases are not set at a level that allows the Utility to recover the cost of providing natural gas transmission service and a reasonable return on its investment in future periods, the Utility may be required to discontinue the application of regulatory accounting to its natural gas transmission business. (See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 as well as ""Critical Accounting Policies"" in Item 7. MD&#38;A.) If that occurs, the regulatory assets and liabilities that do not qualify for regulatory accounting treatment would be charged against income in the period in which that determination was made and these charges could have a material impact on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results. In addition, if regulatory accounting did not apply, the Utility&#8217;s future financial results could become more volatile as compared to historical financial results due to the differences in the timing of expense or gain recognition. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results depend upon the Utility&#8217;s continuing ability to recover &#8220;pass-through&#8221; costs, including electricity and natural gas procurement costs, from customers in a timely manner. The CPUC may disallow procurement costs for a variety of reasons. In addition, the Utility&#8217;s ability to recover these costs could be affected by the loss of Utility customers and decreased new customer growth, if the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility&#8217;s rates to reflect such events. 
The Utility meets customer demand for electricity from a variety of sources, including electricity generated from the Utility&#8217;s own generation facilities, electricity provided by third parties under power purchase agreements, and purchases on the wholesale electricity market. The Utility must manage these sources using the commercial and CPUC regulatory principles of &#8220;least cost dispatch&#8221; and prudent administration of power purchase agreements in compliance with its CPUC-approved long-term procurement plan. The CPUC could disallow procurement costs incurred by the Utility if the CPUC determines that the Utility did not comply with these principles or if the Utility did not comply with its procurement plan. Further, the contractual prices for electricity under the Utility&#8217;s power purchase agreements could become uneconomic in the future for a variety of reasons, including developments in alternative energy technology, increased self-generation by customers, an increase in distributed generation, and lower customer demand due to adverse economic conditions or the loss of the Utility&#8217;s customers to other generation providers. Despite original CPUC approval of the contracts, the CPUC could disallow contract costs if it determines that the costs are unreasonably above market. The Utility also could incur a CPUC disallowance and/or liability to the counterparties under its contracts to procure electricity from conventional and renewable generation resources if such resources are physically curtailed by the CAISO during periods of over-generation when generation resources scheduled with the CAISO exceed customer load. 
The Utility&#8217;s ability to recover the costs it incurs in the wholesale electricity market may be affected by the whether the wholesale electricity market in California continues to function effectively. Although market mechanisms are designed to limit excessive prices, these market mechanisms could fail, or the related systems and software on which the market mechanisms rely may not perform as intended which could result in excessive market prices. The CPUC could prohibit the Utility from passing through the higher costs of electricity to customers. For example, during the 2000 and 2001 energy crisis, the market mechanism flaws in California&#8217;s then-newly established wholesale electricity market led to dramatically high market prices for electricity that the Utility was unable to recover through customer rates, ultimately causing the Utility to file a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
Further, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be affected by the loss of Utility customers and decreased new customer growth that occurs through municipalization of the Utility&#8217;s facilities, an increase in the number of CCAs who provide electricity to their residents, and an increase in the number of consumers who become direct access customers of alternative generation providers. (See &#8220;Competition in the Electric Industry&#8221; in Item 1.) As the number of bundled customers (i.e., those primarily residential customers who receive electricity and distribution service from the Utility) declines, the rates for remaining customers could increase as the Utility would have a smaller customer base from which to recover its procurement costs. Although the Utility is permitted to collect non-bypassable charges for generation-related costs incurred on behalf of former customers, as well as charges for distribution, metering, or other services the Utility continues to provide to such customers, the charges may not be sufficient for the Utility to fully recover the costs to provide these services. In addition, the Utility&#8217;s ability to collect non-bypassable charges has been, and may continue to be, challenged by certain customer groups. Furthermore, if the former customers return to receiving electricity supply from the Utility, the Utility could incur costs to meet their electricity needs that it may not be able to timely recover through rates or that it may not be able to recover at all. 
In addition, increasing levels of self-generation of electricity by customers (primarily solar installations) and the use of customer net energy metering, which allows self-generating customers to receive bill credits for surplus power at the full retail rate, could put upward rate pressure on remaining customers. Also, a confluence of technology-related cost declines and sustained federal or state subsidies could make a combination of distributed generation and energy storage a viable, cost-effective alternative to the Utility&#8217;s bundled electric service which could further threaten the Utility&#8217;s ability to recover its generation, transmission, and distribution investments. If the number of the Utility&#8217;s customers decreases or grows at a slower rate than anticipated, the Utility&#8217;s level of capital investment would likely decline as well, in turn leading to a slower growth in rate base and earnings. Reduced energy demand or significantly slowed growth in demand due to customer migration to other energy providers, adoption of energy efficient technology, conservation, increasing levels of distributed generation and self-generation, unless substantially offset through regulatory cost allocations, could adversely impact PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected if the Utility is unable to recover a material portion of its procurement costs and/or if the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility&#8217;s rates to reflect the impact of changing loads, the wide deployment of distributed generation, and the development of new electricity generation and energy storage technologies. 
Risks Related to Liquidity and Capital Requirements 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results will be affected by their ability to continue accessing the capital markets and by the terms of debt and equity financings. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to access the capital and credit markets and the costs and terms of available financing depend on many factors, including the ultimate outcome of the matters discussed under &#8220;Enforcement and Litigation Matters&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A., the ultimate amount of costs the Utility incurs but does not recover through rates, and the outcome of pending and future ratemaking proceedings. These outcomes in turn can affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s credit ratings and outlook. If PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s or the Utility&#8217;s credit ratings were downgraded to below investment grade, their ability to access the capital and credit markets would be negatively affected and could result in higher borrowing costs, fewer financing options, including reduced access to the commercial paper market, additional collateral posting requirements, which in turn could affect liquidity and lead to an increased financing need. Other factors can affect the availability and terms of debt and equity financing, including changes in the federal or state regulatory environment affecting energy companies generally or PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility in particular, the overall health of the energy industry, volatility in electricity or natural gas prices, and general economic and financial market conditions. 
The reputations of PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility continue to suffer from the negative publicity about the CPUC investigations, the criminal investigations, the criminal prosecution, and the other pending enforcement matters. Their negative reputations and continuing uncertainty surrounding the outcomes of these matters may undermine investors&#8217; confidence in management&#8217;s ability to execute its business strategy and restore a constructive regulatory environment. As a result, investors may be less willing to buy shares of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock resulting in a lower stock price. Further, the market price of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock could decline materially after the outcomes are determined. The amount and timing of future share issuances also could affect the stock price. Declines in the stock price would increase the dilutive effect of future stock issuances and make it more difficult or expensive for PG&#38;E Corporation to complete future equity offerings. 
If the Utility were unable to access the capital markets, it could be required to decrease or suspend dividends to PG&#38;E Corporation and PG&#38;E Corporation could be required to contribute capital to the Utility to enable the Utility to fulfill its obligation to serve. To maintain PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s dividend level in these circumstances, PG&#38;E Corporation would be further required to access the capital or credit markets. PG&#38;E Corporation may need to decrease or discontinue its common stock dividend if it is unable to access the capital or credit markets on reasonable terms. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s ability to meet its debt service and other financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the Utility&#8217;s earnings and cash flows. 
PG&#38;E Corporation is a holding company with no revenue generating operations of its own. The Utility must use its resources to satisfy its own obligations, including its obligation to serve customers, to pay principal and interest on outstanding debt, to pay preferred stock dividends, and meet its obligations to employees and creditors, before it can distribute cash to PG&#38;E Corporation. Under the CPUC&#8217;s rules applicable to utility holding companies, the Utility&#8217;s dividend policy must be established by the Utility's Board of Directors as though the Utility were a stand-alone utility company and PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s Board of Directors give &#8220;first priority&#8221; to the Utility&#8217;s capital requirements, as determined to be necessary and prudent to meet the Utility&#8217;s obligation to serve or to operate the Utility in a prudent and efficient manner. The CPUC has interpreted this &#8220;first priority&#8221; obligation to include the requirement that PG&#38;E Corporation &#8220;infuse the Utility with all types of capital necessary for the Utility to fulfill its obligation to serve.&#8221; In addition, before the Utility can pay common stock dividends to PG&#38;E Corporation, the Utility must maintain its authorized capital structure with an average 52% equity component. 
Depending on the outcome of the CPUC investigations, criminal prosecution, and other enforcement matters pending against the Utility, future issuances of PG&#38;E Corporation common stock may materially dilute EPS. (See &#8220;Liquidity and Financial Resources&#8221; in Item 7. MD&#38;A.) Further, if PG&#38;E Corporation were required to infuse the Utility with significant capital or if the Utility was unable to distribute cash to PG&#38;E Corporation, or both, PG&#38;E Corporation may be unable to pay principal and interest on its outstanding debt, pay its common stock dividend or meet other obligations. 
PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s ability to pay dividends also could be affected by financial covenants contained in their respective credit agreements that require each company to maintain a ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated capitalization of at most 65%. 
Risks Related to Operations and Information Technology 
The operations of the Utility&#8217;s electricity and natural gas generation, transmission, and distribution facilities is inherently dangerous and involves significant risks which, if they materialize, can adversely affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results, and the Utility&#8217;s insurance may not be sufficient to cover losses caused by an operating failure or catastrophic event. 
The Utility owns and operates extensive electricity and natural gas facilities, including two nuclear generation units and an extensive &#160; hydroelectric generating system. (See &#8220;Utility Operations&#8221; in Item 1. Business.) The Utility&#8217;s ability to earn its authorized ROE depends on its ability to efficiently maintain, operate, and protect its facilities, and provide electricity and natural gas services safely and reliably. The Utility undertakes substantial capital investment projects to construct, replace, and improve its electricity and natural gas facilities. In addition, the Utility is obligated to decommission its electricity generation facilities at the end of their useful operating lives. The Utility&#8217;s ability to safely and reliably operate, maintain, construct and decommission its facilities is subject to numerous risks, many of which are beyond the Utility&#8217;s control, including those that arise from: 
the breakdown or failure of equipment, electric transmission or distribution lines, or natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines, that can cause explosions, fires, or other catastrophic events (such as the San Bruno accident discussed in Item 7. MD&#38;A.); 
the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity, natural disaster, or terrorist act; 
the failure of a large dam or other major hydroelectric facility, or the failure of one or more levees that protect land on which the Utility&#8217;s assets are built; 
the failure to take expeditious or sufficient action to mitigate operating conditions, facilities, or equipment, that the Utility has identified, or reasonably should have identified, as unsafe, which failure then leads to a catastrophic event (such as a wild land fire or natural gas explosion), and the failure to respond effectively to a catastrophic event; 
severe weather events such as storms, tornadoes, floods, drought, earthquakes, tsunamis, wild land and other fires, pandemics, solar events, electromagnetic events, or other natural disasters; 
operator or other human error; 
construction performed by third parties, such as ground excavation or &#8220;dig-ins&#8221; that damage the Utility&#8217;s underground facilities; 
the release of hazardous or toxic substances into the air, water, or soil; and 
attacks by third parties, including cyber-attacks, acts of terrorism, vandalism, or war. 
The occurrence of any of these events could interrupt fuel supplies; affect demand for electricity or natural gas; cause unplanned outages or reduce generating output; damage the Utility&#8217;s assets or operations; damage the assets or operations of third parties on which the Utility relies; damage property owned by customers or others; and cause personal injury or death. As a result, the Utility could incur costs to purchase replacement power, to repair assets and restore service, to compensate third parties, or to pay penalties or implement remedial measures. These costs may not be recoverable through rates or insurance and could have a material impact of PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s financial results and reputation. As an example, see the discussion in Item 7. MD&#38;A. of the Utility&#8217;s unrecovered pipeline-related costs incurred since the San Bruno accident. 
Further, although the Utility often enters into agreements for third-party contractors to perform work, such as patrolling and inspection of facilities or the construction or demolition or facilities, the Utility may retain liability for the quality and completion of the contractor&#8217;s work and can be subject to penalties or other enforcement action if the contractor violates applicable laws, rules, regulations, or orders. Insurance, equipment warranties, or other contractual indemnification requirements may not be sufficient or effective to provide full or even partial recovery under all circumstances or against all hazards or liabilities to which the Utility may become subject. An uninsured loss could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results. Future insurance coverage may not be available at rates and on terms as favorable as the Utility&#8217;s current insurance coverage or may not be available at all. 
The Utility&#8217;s operational and information technology systems could fail to function properly or be damaged by third parties (including cyber-attacks and acts of terrorism), severe weather, natural disasters, or other events. Any of these events could disrupt the Utility&#8217;s operations and cause the Utility to incur unanticipated losses and expense or liability to third parties. 
The operation of the Utility&#8217;s extensive electricity and natural gas systems rely on evolving information and operational technology systems and network infrastructures that are becoming more complex as new technologies and systems are implemented to modernize capabilities to safely and reliably deliver gas and electric services. The Utility&#8217;s ability to serve its customers requires the continued operation of complex information technology systems and network infrastructure that are interconnected with the systems and infrastructure owned by third parties. The Utility&#8217;s business is highly dependent on its ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number of tasks and transactions, many of which are highly complex. Despite implementation of security measures, all of the Utility&#8217;s technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism and other causes. The failure of the Utility&#8217;s information and operational systems and networks due to a physical attack, cyber-attack or other cause could significantly disrupt operations; cause harm to the public or employees; result in outages or reduced generating output; damage the Utility&#8217;s assets or operations or those of third parties; and subject the Utility to claims by customers or third parties, any of which could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results. 
The Utility&#8217;s systems, including its financial information, operational systems, advanced metering, and billing systems, require ongoing maintenance, modification, and updating, which can be costly and increase the risk of errors and malfunction. The Utility often relies on third-party vendors to maintain, modify, and update its systems and these third-party vendors could cease to exist. Any disruptions or deficiencies in existing systems, or disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the modification or implementation of new systems, could result in increased costs, the inability to track or collect revenues, the diversion of management&#8217;s and employees&#8217; attention and resources, and could negatively affect the effectiveness of the Utility&#8217;s control environment, and/or the Utility&#8217;s ability to timely file required regulatory reports. 
In addition, the Utility&#8217;s information systems contain confidential information, including information about customers and employees. The theft, damage, or improper disclosure of confidential information can subject the Utility to penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, subject the Utility to claims from third parties, reduce the value of proprietary information, and harm the Utility&#8217;s reputation. 
The operation and decommissioning of the Utility&#8217;s nuclear power plants expose it to potentially significant liabilities and the Utility may not be able to fully recover its costs if regulatory requirements change or the plant ceases operations before the licenses expire. 
The operation of the Utility&#8217;s nuclear generation facilities exposes it to potentially significant liabilities from environmental, health and financial risks, such as risks relating to the storage, handling and disposal of spent nuclear fuel, the release of radioactive materials caused by a nuclear accident, seismic activity, natural disaster, or terrorist act. The operation of the nuclear facilities also depends on the availability of adequate fuel supplies. If the Utility incurs losses that are either not covered by insurance or exceed the amount of insurance available, such losses could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results. In addition, the Utility may be required under federal law to pay up to $255 million of liabilities arising out of each nuclear incident occurring not only at the Utility&#8217;s Diablo Canyon facility but at any other nuclear power plant in the United States. (See Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) 
In addition, the Utility continues to face public concern about the safety of nuclear generation and nuclear fuel. Some of these nuclear opposition groups regularly file petitions at the NRC and in other forums challenging the actions of the NRC and urging governmental entities to adopt laws or policies in opposition to nuclear power. Although an action in opposition may ultimately fail, regulatory proceedings may take longer to conclude and be more costly to complete. It is also possible that public pressure could grow and that future changes in legislation, regulations, orders, or their interpretation, could result in the Utility ceasing operations at Diablo Canyon before the licenses expire. In such an instance, the Utility could be required to record a charge for the remaining amount of its unrecovered investment and such charge could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility&#8217;s financial results. 
The Utility has incurred, and may continue to incur, substantial costs to comply with NRC regulations and orders. (See &#8220;Regulatory Environment&#8221; in Item 1. Business.) If the Utility were unable to recover these costs, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected. The Utility may determine that it cannot comply with the new regulations or orders in a feasible and economic manner and voluntarily cease operations; alternatively, the NRC may order the Utility to cease operations until it can comply with new regulations, orders, or decisions. The Utility may incur a material charge if it ceases operations at Diablo Canyon before the licenses expire. 
At the state level, the California Water Board has adopted a policy on once-through cooling that generally requires the installation of cooling towers or other significant measures to reduce the impact on marine life from existing power generation facilities in California by at least 85%. If the California Water Board requires the installation of cooling towers that the Utility believes are not technically or economically feasible, the Utility may be forced to cease operations at Diablo Canyon and may incur a material charge. Even if the Utility is not required to install cooling towers, it could incur significant costs to comply with alternative compliances measures or to make payments to support various environmental mitigation projects. 
The Utility also has an obligation to decommission its electricity generation facilities, including its nuclear facilities, as well as gas transmission system assets, at the end of their useful lives. (See Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#8211; Asset Retirement Obligations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statement in Item 8.) The CPUC authorizes the Utility to recover its estimated costs to decommission its nuclear facilities through nuclear decommissioning charges that are collected from customers and held in nuclear decommissioning trusts to be used for the eventual decommissioning of each nuclear unit. If the Utility&#8217;s actual decommissioning costs, including the amounts held in the nuclear decommissioning trusts, exceed estimated costs, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected. 
Risks Related to Environmental Factors 
The Utility&#8217;s operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and changes in or liabilities under these laws could adversely affect PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results. 
The Utility&#8217;s operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws, regulations, orders, relating to air quality, water quality and usage, remediation of hazardous wastes, and the protection and conservation of natural resources and wildlife. The Utility incurs significant capital, operating, and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental statutes, rules, and regulations. The Utility has been, and may be, required to pay for environmental remediation costs at sites where it is identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws. Although the Utility has recorded liabilities for known environmental obligations, these costs can be difficult to estimate due to uncertainties about the extent of contamination, remediation alternatives, the applicable remediation levels, and the financial ability of other potentially responsible parties. (See Note 14 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for more information.) 
Environmental remediation costs could increase in the future as a result of new legislation, the current trend toward more stringent standards, and stricter and more expansive application of existing environmental regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or failure to comply with the terms of licenses or permits issued by environmental or regulatory agencies, could expose the Utility to claims by third parties or the imposition of civil or criminal fines or other sanctions. 
The CPUC has authorized the Utility to recover its environmental remediation costs for certain sites through various ratemaking mechanisms. One of these mechanisms allows the Utility rate recovery for 90% of its hazardous substance remediation costs for certain approved sites without a reasonableness review. The CPUC may discontinue or change these ratemaking mechanisms in the future or the Utility may incur environmental costs that exceed amounts the CPUC has authorized the Utility to recover in rates. 
Some of the Utility&#8217;s environmental costs, such as the remediation costs associated with the Hinkley natural gas compressor site, are not recoverable through rates or insurance. (See &#8220;Environmental Regulation&#8221; in Item 1.) The Utility&#8217;s costs to remediate groundwater contamination near the Hinkley natural gas compressor site and to abate the effects of the contamination have had, and may continue to have, a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results. Their financial results also can be materially affected by changes in estimated costs and by the extent to which actual remediation costs differ from recorded liabilities. 
The Utility&#8217;s future operations may be affected by climate change that may have a material impact on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
The Utility has been studying the potential effects of climate change (increased temperatures, reduced precipitation, rising sea levels) on the Utility&#8217;s operations and is developing contingency plans to adapt to those events and conditions that the Utility believes are most significant. Scientists project that climate change will increase electricity demand due to more extreme, persistent and hot weather. Increasing temperatures and lower levels of precipitation in the Utility&#8217;s service territory would reduce snowpack in the Sierra Mountains. If the levels of snowpack were reduced, the Utility&#8217;s hydroelectric generation would decrease and the Utility would need to acquire additional generation from other sources at a greater cost. Should the Utility increase reliance on conventional generation resources to replace hydroelectric generation and to meet increased customer demand, it may become more costly for the Utility to comply with GHG emissions limits. In addition, increasing temperatures and lower levels of precipitation could increase the occurrence of wildfires in the Utility&#8217;s service territory causing damage to the Utility&#8217;s facilities or the facilities of third parties on which the Utility relies to provide service. In addition, flooding caused by rising sea levels could damage the Utility&#8217;s facilities, including hydroelectric assets such as dams and canals, and the electric transmission assets that are located on levees throughout the Utility&#8217;s service territory. The Utility could incur substantial costs to repair or replace facilities, restore service, compensate customers and other third parties for damages or injuries. The Utility anticipates that the increased costs would be recovered through rates, but as rate pressures increase, the likelihood of disallowance or non-recovery may increase. 
Events or conditions caused by climate change could have a greater impact on the Utility&#8217;s operations than the Utility&#8217;s studies suggest and could result in lower revenues or increased expenses, or both. If the CPUC fails to adjust the Utility&#8217;s rates to reflect the impact of events or conditions caused by climate change, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially affected. 
Other Risk Factors 
The Utility may be required to incur substantial costs in order to obtain or renew licenses and permits needed to operate the Utility&#8217;s business and the Utility may be subject to fines and penalties for failure to comply or obtain license renewal. 
The Utility must comply with the terms of various governmental permits, authorizations, and licenses, including those issued by the FERC for the continued operation of the Utility&#8217;s hydroelectric generation facilities, and those issued by environmental and other federal, state and local governmental agencies. Many of the Utility&#8217;s capital investment projects, and some maintenance activities, often require the Utility to obtain land use, construction, environmental, or other governmental permits. These permits, authorizations, and licenses may be difficult to obtain on a timely basis, causing work delays. Further, existing permits and licenses could be revoked or modified by the agencies that granted them if facts develop that differ significantly from the facts assumed when they were issued. In addition, the Utility often seeks periodic renewal of a license or permit, such as a waste discharge permit or a FERC operating license for a hydroelectric generation facility. If a license or permit is not renewed for a particular facility and the Utility is required to cease operations at that facility, the Utility could incur an impairment charge or other costs. Before renewing a permit or license, the issuing agency may impose additional requirements that may increase the Utility&#8217;s compliance costs. In particular, in connection with a license renewal for one or more of the Utility&#8217;s hydroelectric generation facilities or assets, the FERC may impose new license conditions that could, among other things, require increased expenditures or result in reduced electricity output and/or capacity at the facility. In addition, local governments may attempt to assert jurisdiction over various utility operations by requiring permits or other approvals that the Utility has not been previously required to obtain. 
The Utility may incur penalties and sanctions for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of licenses and permits which could have a material effect on PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. If the Utility cannot obtain, renew, or comply with necessary governmental permits, authorizations, licenses, ordinances, or other requirements, or if the Utility cannot recover the increase in associated compliance and other costs in a timely manner, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected. 
Poor investment performance or other factors could require PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility to make significant unplanned contributions to its pension plan, other postretirement benefits plans, and nuclear decommissioning trusts. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility provide defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits for eligible employees and retirees. The Utility also maintains three trusts for the purposes of providing funds to decommission its nuclear facilities. The performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of plan assets and trust assets. A decline in the market value may increase the funding requirements for these plans and trusts. The cost of providing pension and other postretirement benefits is also affected by other factors, including interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels, the rate of return on plan assets, employee demographics, discount rates used in determining future benefit obligations, rates of increase in health care costs, future government regulation, and prior contributions to the plans. Similarly, funding requirements for the nuclear decommissioning trusts are affected by the rates of return on trust assets, changes in the laws or regulations regarding nuclear decommissioning or decommissioning funding requirements as well as changes in assumptions or forecasts related to decommissioning dates, technology and the cost of labor, materials and equipment. (See Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.) If the Utility is required to make significant unplanned contributions to fund the pension and postretirement plans or if actual nuclear decommissioning costs exceed the amount of nuclear decommissioning trust funds and the Utility is unable to recover the contributions or additional costs in rates, PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial results could be materially affected. 
The Utility&#8217;s success depends on the availability of the services of a qualified workforce and its ability to maintain satisfactory collective bargaining agreements which cover a substantial number of employees. PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s results may suffer if the Utility is unable to attract and retain qualified personnel and senior management talent, or if prolonged labor disruptions occur. 
The Utility&#8217;s workforce is aging and many employees are or will become eligible to retire within the next few years. Although the Utility has undertaken efforts to recruit and train new field service personnel, the Utility may be faced with a shortage of experienced and qualified personnel. The majority of the Utility&#8217;s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with three unions. Labor disruptions could occur depending on the outcome of negotiations to renew the terms of these agreements. In addition, some of the remaining non-represented Utility employees could join one of these unions in the future. 
PG&#38;E Corporation and the Utility also may face challenges in attracting and retaining senior management talent especially if they are unable to restore the reputational harm generated by the negative publicity stemming from the ongoing enforcement proceedings. Any such occurrences could negatively impact PG&#38;E Corporation&#8217;s and the Utility&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations.
