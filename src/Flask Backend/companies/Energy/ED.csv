CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2023 
Information in any item of this report as to which reference is made in this Item 1A is incorporated by reference herein. The use of such terms as &#8220;see&#8221; or &#8220;refer to&#8221; shall be deemed to incorporate at the place such term is used the information to which such reference is made. 
The Companies&#8217; businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, and that involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual operating results, cash flows and financial condition. 
The Companies have established an enterprise risk management program to identify, assess, manage and monitor its major business risks based on established criteria for the severity of an event, the likelihood of its occurrence, and the programs in place to control the event or reduce its impact. The Companies&#8217; major risks include: 
Regulatory/Compliance Risks: 
The Companies Are Extensively Regulated And Are Subject To Substantial Penalties. The Companies&#8217; operations require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental agencies. State utility regulators may seek to impose substantial penalties on the Utilities for violations of state utility laws, regulations or orders or limit the Utilities from recovering costs incurred above amounts set forth in their rate plans. See &#8220;Other Regulatory Matters&#8221; in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. The Utilities are also subject to recurring, independent, third-party audits with respect to these regulations and standards. In addition, the Utilities' rate plans usually include negative revenue adjustments for failing to meet certain operating and customer satisfaction standards. FERC has the authority to impose penalties on the Utilities and the projects that Con Edison Transmission invests in, which could be substantial, for violations of the Federal Power Act, the Natural Gas Act or related rules, including reliability and cybersecurity rules. Environmental agencies may seek penalties for failure to comply with laws, regulations or permits. The Companies may also be subject to penalties from other regulatory agencies. The Companies may be subject to new laws, regulations or other requirements or the revision or reinterpretation of such requirements, which could adversely affect them. See &#8220;Utility Regulation"", ""Competition"" and &#8220;Environmental Matters &#8211; Climate Change"" and ""Environmental Matters - Other Federal, State and Local Environmental Provisions&#8221; in Item 1, &#8220;Critical Accounting Estimates&#8221; in Item 7 and &#8220;Other Regulatory Matters&#8221; in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. 
The Utilities&#8217; Rate Plans May Not Provide A Reasonable Return. The Utilities have rate plans approved by state utility regulators that limit the rates they can charge their customers. The rates are generally designed for, but do not guarantee, the recovery of the Utilities&#8217; cost of providing service (including a return on equity). See &#8220;Utility Regulation &#8211; State Utility Regulation &#8211; Rate Plans&#8221; in Item 1 and &#8220;Rate Plans&#8221; in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. Rates usually may not be changed during the specified terms of the rate plans other than to recover energy costs and limited other exceptions. The Utilities&#8217; actual costs may exceed levels provided for such costs in the rate plans. State utility regulators can initiate proceedings to prohibit the Utilities from recovering from their customers the cost of service (including energy costs and storm restoration costs) that the regulators determine to have been imprudently incurred. The Utilities have from time to time entered into settlement agreements to resolve various prudence proceedings. 
The Companies May Be Adversely Affected By Changes To The Utilities&#8217; Rate Plans. The Utilities&#8217; rate plans typically require action by regulators at their expiration dates, which may include approval of new plans with different provisions. The need to recover from customers increasing commodity or other costs, taxes or state-mandated assessments or surcharges could adversely affect the Utilities&#8217; opportunity to obtain new rate plans that provide a reasonable rate of return and continue important provisions of current rate plans. The Utilities&#8217; current New York electric and gas rate plans include revenue decoupling mechanisms, CECONY&#8217;s current steam rate plan includes a weather normalization adjustment and the Utilities' New York electric, gas and steam rate plans include provisions for the recovery of energy costs and reconciliation of the actual amount of pension and other postretirement, environmental and certain other costs to amounts reflected in rates. Accounting credits for pension and other postretirement benefit plans could lead to a reduction in cash received from the Utilities&#8217; revenue requirement. See &#8220;Rate Plans&#8221; in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. 
Operations Risks: 
The Failure Of, Or Damage To, The Companies&#8217; Facilities Could Adversely Affect The Companies. The Utilities provide electricity, gas and steam service using energy facilities, many of which are located either in, or close to, densely populated public places. See the description of the Utilities&#8217; facilities in Item 1. A failure of, or damage to, these facilities, or an error in the operation or maintenance of these facilities, could result in bodily injury or death, property damage, the release of hazardous substances or extended service interruptions. Impacts of climate change, such as sea level rise, coastal storm surge, inland flooding from intense rainfall, hurricane-strength winds and extreme heat or cold could impact or damage facilities or result in large-scale outages and the Utilities may experience more severe consequences from attempting to operate during and after such events. The Utilities&#8217; response to such events may be perceived to be below customer expectations. The Utilities' successful implementation of their maintenance programs reduces, but does not fully protect against, damage to their facilities for which they will be held responsible and which may hinder their restoration efforts. The Utilities could be required to pay substantial amounts that may not be covered by the Utilities&#8217; insurance policies to repair or replace their facilities, compensate others for injury or death or other damage and settle any proceedings initiated by state utility regulators or other regulatory agencies. The occurrence of such events could also adversely affect the cost and availability of insurance. Changes to laws, regulations or judicial doctrines could further expand the Utilities&#8217; liability for service interruptions. See &#8220;Utility Regulation &#8211; State Utility Regulation&#8221; and ""Environmental Matters &#8211; Climate Change"" in Item 1. 
A Cyber Attack Could Adversely Affect The Companies. The Companies and other operators of critical energy infrastructure and energy market participants face a heightened risk of cyber attack and the Companies&#8217; businesses require the continued operation of information systems and network infrastructure. See Item 1 for a description of the businesses of the Utilities and Con Edison Transmission. Cyber attacks may include hacking, viruses, malware, denial of service attacks, ransomware, exploited vulnerabilities or other security breaches, including loss of data and communications. Cyber threats in general, and in particular to critical infrastructure, are increasing in sophistication, magnitude and frequency and the techniques used in cyberattacks change rapidly, including from emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence. Interconnectivity with customers, independent system operators, energy traders and other energy market participants, suppliers, contractors and others also exposes the Companies&#8217; information systems and network infrastructure to an increased risk of cyber incidents, including attacks. Such interconnectivity increases the risk that a cyber incident or attack on the Companies could affect others and that a cyber incident or attack on others could affect the Companies. In the event of a cyber incident or attack that the Companies were unable to defend against or mitigate, the Companies could have their operations and the operations of their customers and others disrupted. The Companies could also have their financial and other information systems and network infrastructure impaired, property damaged, and customer and employee information stolen; experience substantial loss of revenues, response costs and other financial loss; and be subject to increased regulation, litigation, penalties and damage to their reputation. In October 2023, threat actors exploited a vulnerability in Citrix NetScaler that was remediated and reported to the relevant regulatory authorities by the Companies. Also during 2023, the Companies experienced increases in malicious attempts to disrupt traffic to their websites and in attacks against third-party vendors employed by the Companies. The Companies have experienced cyber incidents and attacks in the past and expect to experience them in the future. Although none of these incidents has had a material impact on the Companies, the scope and impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. In the event of a cybersecurity incident or attack that the Companies were unable to defend against or mitigate, the Companies&#8217; business strategy, results of operations or financial condition are reasonably likely to be materially affected. 
The Failure of Processes and Systems, the Failure to Retain and Attract Employees and Contractors, and Their Negative Performance Could Adversely Affect The Companies. The Companies have developed business processes and use information and communication systems and enterprise platforms for operations, customer service, legal compliance, personnel, accounting, planning and other matters. In October 2023, CECONY and O&#38;R replaced their separate existing customer billing and information systems with a single new customer billing and information system to further automate the processes by which the Utilities bill their customers and enhance payment, credit and collections activities. Failures in successfully implementing the new customer billing and information system could adversely affect the Utilities&#8217; billing and revenue collection processes and cash flow and could result in higher costs. Many services, including certain information technology services and certain work on the Utilities&#8217; electric and gas systems and CECONY&#8217;s steam system, are provided to the Companies by third-party contractors. The failure of the Companies&#8217; or its contractors' business processes or information and communication systems or the failure by the Companies&#8217; employees or contractors to follow procedures, their unsafe actions, errors or intentional misconduct, cyber incidents or attacks, or work stoppages could adversely affect the Companies&#8217; operations and liquidity and could result in substantial liability, higher costs, increased regulatory requirements and substantial penalties. The violation of laws or regulations by employees or contractors for personal gain may result from contract and procurement fraud, extortion, bribe acceptance, fraudulent related-party transactions and serious breaches of corporate policy or standards of business conduct. Competition for 
CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2023 
employee and contractor talent may result in operating challenges and increased costs to attract and retain talent. If the Companies are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, their results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be negatively affected. See &#8220;Human Capital&#8221; in Item 1. 
Environmental Risks: 
The Companies Are Exposed To Risks From The Environmental Consequences Of Their Operations. The Companies are exposed to risks relating to climate change and related matters. In 2023, CECONY and O&#38;R each completed a climate change vulnerability study that evaluated their respective future climate change adaptation strategies and each developed a climate change resilience plan to address projected physical climate risks and outline resilience investments. CECONY may be impacted by environmental regulations regarding emissions reductions such as New York&#8217;s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act and New York City&#8217;s Climate Mobilization Act. In addition, the Utilities are responsible for hazardous substances, such as oil, asbestos, PCBs and coal tar, that have been used or produced in the course of the Utilities&#8217; operations and are present on properties or in facilities and equipment currently or previously owned by them. The Companies could be adversely affected if a causal relationship between electric and magnetic fields and adverse health effects were to be established. The Companies may also be adversely affected by developments to legal or public policy doctrines regarding cable that contains lead. See &#8220;Environmental Matters&#8221; in Item 1 and Note G to the financial statements in Item 8. 
Financial and Market Risks: 
Con Edison&#8217;s Ability To Pay Dividends Or Interest Depends On Dividends From Its Subsidiaries. Con Edison&#8217;s ability to pay dividends on its common shares or interest on its external borrowings depends primarily on the dividends and other distributions it receives from its subsidiaries. The dividends that the Utilities may pay to Con Edison are limited by the NYSPSC to not more than 100 percent of their respective income available for dividends calculated on a two-year rolling average basis, with certain exceptions. See &#8220;Dividends&#8221; in Note C and Note U to the financial statements in Item 8. 
Changes To Tax Laws Could Adversely Affect the Companies. Changes to tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof could have a material adverse impact on the Companies. Depending on the extent of these changes, the changes could also adversely impact the Companies&#8217; credit ratings and liquidity. See &#8220;Capital Requirements and Resources &#8211; Capital Resources&#8221; in Item 1, &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources &#8211; Cash Flows from Operating Activities&#8221; in Item 7, ""Rate Plans"" and ""Other Regulatory Matters"" in Note B and Note L to the financial statements in Item 8. 
The Companies Require Access To Capital Markets To Satisfy Funding Requirements. The Utilities estimate that their construction expenditures will exceed $27,700 million over the next five years. The Utilities use internally-generated funds, equity contributions from Con Edison, if any, and external borrowings to fund construction expenditures. Con Edison expects to finance its capital requirements primarily through internally generated funds, the sale of its common shares or external borrowings. Changes in financial market conditions or in the Companies&#8217; credit ratings could adversely affect their ability to raise new capital and the cost thereof. See &#8220;Capital Requirements and Resources&#8221; in Item 1. 
A Disruption In The Wholesale Energy Markets, Increased Commodity Costs Or Failure By An Energy Supplier or Customer Could Adversely Affect The Companies. &#160; Almost all the electricity and gas the Utilities sell to their full-service customers is purchased through the wholesale energy markets or pursuant to contracts with energy suppliers. See the description of the Utilities&#8217; energy supply in Item 1. A disruption in the wholesale energy markets or a failure on the part of the Utilities&#8217; energy suppliers or operators of energy delivery systems that connect to the Utilities&#8217; energy facilities could adversely affect their ability to meet their customers&#8217; energy needs and adversely affect the Companies. The Utilities' ability to gain access to additional energy supplies, if needed, depends on effective markets and siting approvals for developer projects, which the Utilities do not control. An extreme cold weather event in December 2022 (Winter Storm Elliott) negatively impacted energy infrastructure in the northeastern United States, including the interstate natural gas system. During Winter Storm Elliott, CECONY faced low pressures on the interstate natural gas pipelines that it relies upon to deliver gas to its customers. Although CECONY maintained system pressure, the low pressure could have resulted in unprecedented large-scale gas outages within CECONY&#8217;s territory. CECONY estimates that, in the worst case, restoring gas service could have taken months in the event of a complete loss of the system. In the event of a large-scale outage, the Utilities could be required to pay substantial amounts to restore service, compensate others for injury or death or other damages and settle any proceedings initiated by regulatory agencies. In November 2023, FERC, NERC and other regional entities issued recommendations to prevent a recurrence of the effects of Winter Storm Elliott, including establishing and monitoring cold weather reliability standards for interstate natural gas pipelines. Although the Utilities&#8217; rate plans provide for recovery of purchased power costs, increases in electric and gas commodity prices may contribute to a slower recovery of cash from outstanding customer accounts receivable balances. See &#8220;Financial and Commodity Market Risks &#8211; Commodity Price Risk&#8221; in Item 7. 
Other Risks: 
The Companies Face Risks Related To Health Epidemics And Other Outbreaks. &#160; Pandemic illness could disrupt the Utilities' employees and contractors from providing essential utility services and adversely impact the Companies' liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 
The Companies&#8217; Strategies May Not Be Effective To Address Changes In The External Business Environment. The failure to identify, plan and execute strategies to address changes in the external business environment could have a material adverse impact on the Companies. Con Edison seeks to provide shareholder value through continued dividend growth, supported by earnings growth in regulated utilities and contracted electric assets. Changes to the competitive landscape, public policy, laws or regulations (or interpretations thereof), customer behavior or technology could significantly impact the value of the Utilities&#8217; energy delivery facilities and Con Edison Transmission's investment in electric and gas transmission projects. Such changes could also affect the Companies&#8217; opportunities to make additional investments in such assets and the potential return on the investments. The Utilities' gas delivery customers and CECONY's steam delivery customers have alternatives, such as electricity and oil. Distributed energy resources, and demand reduction and energy efficiency investments, provide ways for the energy consumers within the Utilities&#8217; service areas to manage their energy usage. The Companies expect distributed energy resources and electric alternatives to gas and steam to increase, and for gas and steam usage to decrease, as the CLCPA and the Climate Mobilization Act continue to be implemented. See ""Con Edison Transmission,"" ""Environmental Matters - Clean Energy Future"" and ""Environmental Matters - Climate Change,"" &#8220;Competition&#8221; and ""CECONY - Gas Peak Demand"" in Item 1. 
The Companies Face Risks Related To Supply Chain Disruptions And Inflation. The Companies have been impacted, and expect to continue to be impacted by, global and U.S. supply chain disruptions and shortages of materials, equipment, labor and other resources that are critical to the Companies&#8217; business operations, primarily the Utilities&#8217; electric and central operations. Such disruptions and shortages have resulted in increased prices and lead times for critical orders of materials and equipment needed by the Companies in their operations, such as certain raw materials, microprocessors, semiconductors, microchips, vehicles and transformers. Long lead times for replacement parts could restrict the availability and delay the construction, maintenance or repair of items that are needed to support the Utilities' normal operations and may result in prolonged customer outages, which could in turn lead to unrecovered costs for such service interruptions. Demand for electric equipment is increasing due to utilities&#8217; efforts to meet clean energy goals and in order to prepare for more frequent extreme weather events at a time when manufacturing capacity and supply are decreasing. Geopolitical conflicts have also caused supply chain distributions and shortages. Prices of materials, equipment, transportation and other resources have increased as a result of these supply chain disruptions and shortages and may continue to increase as a result of inflation. Increases in inflation may raise the Companies &#8217; costs in excess of the costs reflected in the Utilities&#8217; rate plans and could also increase the amount of capital that needs to be raised by the Companies and the costs of such capital. 
The Companies Also Face Other Risks That Are Beyond Their Control. The Companies&#8217; results of operations can be affected by circumstances or events that are beyond their control. Weather and energy efficiency efforts directly influence the demand for electricity, gas and steam service, and can affect the price of energy commodities. Terrorist or other physical attacks or acts of war could damage the Companies' facilities. Economic conditions can affect customers&#8217; demand and ability to pay for service, which could adversely affect the Companies.

The Companies&#8217; businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, and that involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual operating results, cash flows and financial condition. 
The Companies have established an enterprise risk management program to identify, assess, manage and monitor its major business risks based on established criteria for the severity of an event, the likelihood of its occurrence, and the programs in place to control the event or reduce its impact. The Companies&#8217; major risks include:

FERC has the authority to impose penalties on the Utilities, the Clean Energy Businesses and the projects that Con Edison Transmission invests in, which could be substantial, for violations of the Federal Power Act, the Natural Gas Act or related rules, including reliability and cyber security rules. Environmental agencies may seek penalties for failure to comply with laws, regulations or permits. The Companies may also be subject to penalties from other regulatory agencies. The Companies may be subject to new laws, regulations or other requirements or the revision or reinterpretation of such requirements, which could adversely affect them. See &#8220;Utility Regulation"", ""Competition"" and &#8220;Environmental Matters &#8211; Climate Change"" and ""Environmental Matters - Other Federal, State and Local Environmental Provisions&#8221; in Item 1, &#8220;Critical Accounting Estimates&#8221; in Item 7 and &#8220;COVID-19 Regulatory Matters&#8221; and &#8220;Other Regulatory Matters&#8221; in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8.

The rates are generally designed for, but do not guarantee, the recovery of the Utilities&#8217; cost of providing service (including a return on equity). See &#8220;Utility Regulation &#8211; State Utility Regulation &#8211; Rate Plans&#8221; in Item 1 and &#8220;Rate Plans&#8221; in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. Rates usually may not be changed during the specified terms of the rate plans other than to recover energy costs and limited other exceptions. The Utilities&#8217; actual costs may exceed levels provided for such costs in 
CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2022 ##TABLE_END
the rate plans (see &#8220;COVID-19 Regulatory Matters&#8221; in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8). State utility regulators can initiate proceedings to prohibit the Utilities from recovering from their customers the cost of service (including energy costs and storm restoration costs) that the regulators determine to have been imprudently incurred (see ""Other Regulatory Matters"" in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8). The Utilities have from time to time entered into settlement agreements to resolve various prudence proceedings. 
The Companies May Be Adversely Affected By Changes To The Utilities&#8217; Rate Plans. The Utilities&#8217; rate plans typically require action by regulators at their expiration dates, which may include approval of new plans with different provisions. The need to recover from customers increasing commodity or other costs, taxes or state-mandated assessments or surcharges could adversely affect the Utilities&#8217; opportunity to obtain new rate plans that provide a reasonable rate of return and continue important provisions of current rate plans. The Utilities&#8217; current NY electric and gas rate plans include revenue decoupling mechanisms and their NY electric, gas and steam rate plans include provisions for the recovery of energy costs and reconciliation of the actual amount of pension and other postretirement, environmental and certain other costs to amounts reflected in rates. See &#8220;Rate Plans&#8221; in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. 
Operations Risks: 
The Failure Of, Or Damage To, The Companies&#8217; Facilities Could Adversely Affect The Companies. The Utilities provide electricity, gas and steam service using energy facilities, many of which are located either in, or close to, densely populated public places. See the description of the Utilities&#8217; facilities in Item 1. A failure of, or damage to, these facilities, or an error in the operation or maintenance of these facilities, could result in bodily injury or death, property damage, the release of hazardous substances or extended service interruptions. Impacts of climate change, such as sea level rise, coastal storm surge, inland flooding from intense rainfall, hurricane-strength winds and extreme heat could damage facilities and the Utilities may experience more severe consequences from attempting to operate during and after such events. The Utilities&#8217; response to such events may be perceived to be below customer expectations. The Utilities' successful implementation of their maintenance programs reduces, but does not fully protect against, damage to their facilities for which they will be held responsible and which may hinder their restoration efforts. The Utilities could be required to pay substantial amounts that may not be covered by the Utilities&#8217; insurance policies to repair or replace their facilities, compensate others for injury or death or other damage and settle any proceedings initiated by state utility regulators or other regulatory agencies. The occurrence of such events could also adversely affect the cost and availability of insurance. See &#8220;Other Regulatory Matters&#8221; in Note B and &#8220;Manhattan Explosion and Fire&#8221; in Note H to the financial statements in Item 8. Changes to laws, regulations or judicial doctrines could further expand the Utilities&#8217; liability for service interruptions. See &#8220;Utility Regulation &#8211; State Utility Regulation&#8221; and ""Environmental Matters &#8211; Climate Change"" in Item 1. 
A Cyber Attack Could Adversely Affect The Companies. The Companies and other operators of critical energy infrastructure and energy market participants face a heightened risk of cyber attack and the Companies&#8217; businesses require the continued operation of information systems and network infr astructure. See Item 1 for a description of the businesses of the Utilities, the Clean Energy Businesses and Con Edison Transmission. Cyber attacks may include hacking, viruses, malware, denial of service attacks, ransomware, exploited vulnerabilities or other security breac hes, including loss of data and communications. Cyber threats in general, and in particular to critical infrastructure, are increasing in sophistication, magnitude and frequency. Interconnectivity with customers, independent system operators, energy traders and other energy market participants, suppliers, contractors and others also exposes the Companies&#8217; information systems and network infrastructure to an increased risk of cyber incidents, including attacks. Such interconnectivity increases the risk that a cyber incident or attack on the Companies could affect others and that a cyber incident or attack on others could affect the Companies. In the event of a cyber incident or attack that the Companies were unable to defend against or mitigate, the Companies could have their operations and the operations of their customers and others disrupted. The Companies could also have their financial and other information systems and network infrastructure impaired, property damaged, and customer and employee information stolen; experience substantial loss of revenues, response costs and other financial loss; and be subject to increased regulation, litigation, penalties and damage to their reputation. The Companies have experienced cyber incidents and attacks, although none of the incidents or attacks had a material impact. 
The Failure Of Processes and Systems And The Performance And Failure to Retain and Attract Employees And Contractors Could Adversely Affect The Companies. The Companies have developed business processes and use information and communication systems and enterprise platforms for operations, customer service, legal compliance, personnel, accounting, planning and other matters. The Utilities are replacing their existing customer billing and information systems. Failures in successfully implementing the new customer billing and information system could adversely affect the Utilities&#8217; billing and revenue collection processes and cash flow and could result in higher costs. The Companies have completed a multi-year, phased transition of certain information technology services, including application maintenance and support and infrastructure and operations services, to a contractor. The failure of the Companies&#8217; or its contractors' business processes or information and 
communication systems or the failure by the Companies&#8217; employees or contractors to follow procedures, their unsafe actions, errors or intentional misconduct, cyber incidents or attacks, or work stoppages could adversely affect the Companies&#8217; operations and liquidity and result in substantial liability, higher costs and increased regulatory requirements. The violation of laws or regulations by employees or contractors for personal gain may result from contract and procurement fraud, extortion, bribe acceptance, fraudulent related-party transactions and serious breaches of corporate policy or standards of business conduct. Competition for employee and contractor talent may result in operating challenges and increased costs to attract and retain talent. If the Companies are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, their results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be negatively affected. See &#8220;Human Capital&#8221; in Item 1. 
Environmental Risks: 
The Companies Are Exposed To Risks From The Environmental Consequences Of Their Operations. The Companies are exposed to risks relating to climate change and related matters. In 2019, CECONY completed a climate change vulnerability study and during 2020, CECONY further evaluated its future climate change adaptation strategies and developed a climate change implementation plan. NY State enacted the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act and New York City enacted the Climate Mobilization Act . See &#8220;Environmental Matters &#8211; Clean Energy Future&#8221; in Item 1. CECONY may also be impacted by regulations requiring reductions in air emissions. See &#8220;Environmental Matters &#8211; Other Federal, State and Local Environmental Provisions &#8211; Air Quality&#8221; in Item 1. In addition, the Utilities are responsible for hazardous substances, such as oil, asbestos, PCBs and coal tar, that have been used or produced in the course of the Utilities&#8217; operations and are present on properties or in facilities and equipment currently or previously owned by them. See &#8220;Environmental Matters&#8221; in Item 1 and Note G to the financial statements in Item 8. The Companies could be adversely affected if a causal relationship between electric and magnetic fields and adverse health effects were to be established. 
Financial and Market Risks: 
Con Edison&#8217;s Ability To Pay Dividends Or Interest Depends On Dividends From Its Subsidiaries. Con Edison&#8217;s ability to pay dividends on its common shares or interest on its external borrowings depends primarily on the dividends and other distributions it receives from its subsidiaries. The dividends that the Utilities may pay to Con Edison are limited by the NYSPSC to not more than 100 percent of their respective income available for dividends calculated on a two-year rolling average basis, with certain exceptions. See &#8220;Dividends&#8221; in Note C and Note U to the financial statements in Item 8. 
Changes To Tax Laws Could Adversely Affect the Companies. Changes to tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof could have a material adverse impact on the Companies. Depending on the extent of these changes, the changes could also adversely impact the Companies&#8217; credit ratings and liquidity. See &#8220;Capital Requirements and Resources &#8211; Capital Resources&#8221; in Item 1, &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources &#8211; Cash Flows from Operating Activities&#8221; in Item 7, ""Rate Plans"" and ""Other Regulatory Matters"" in Note B and Note L to the financial statements in Item 8. 
The Companies Require Access To Capital Markets To Satisfy Funding Requirements. The Utilities estimate that their construction expenditures will exceed $14,600 million over the next three years. The Utilities use internally-generated funds, equity contributions from Con Edison, if any, and external borrowings to fund the construction expenditures. Con Edison expects to finance its capital requirements primarily through internally generated funds, proceeds from the anticipated sale of the Clean Energy Businesses, the sale of its common shares or external borrowings. Changes in financial market conditions or in the Companies&#8217; credit ratings could adversely affect their ability to raise new capital and the cost thereof. See &#8220;Capital Requirements and Resources&#8221; in Item 1. 
A Disruption In The Wholesale Energy Markets, Increased Commodity Costs Or Failure By An Energy Supplier or Customer Could Adversely Affect The Companies. &#160; Almost all the electricity and gas the Utilities sell to their full-service customers is purchased through the wholesale energy markets or pursuant to contracts with energy suppliers. See the description of the Utilities&#8217; energy supply in Item 1. A disruption in the wholesale energy markets or a failure on the part of the Utilities&#8217; energy suppliers or operators of energy delivery systems that connect to the Utilities&#8217; energy facilities could adversely affect their ability to meet their customers&#8217; energy needs and adversely affect the Companies. The Utilities' ability to gain access to additional energy supplies, if needed, depends on effective markets and siting approvals for developer projects, which the Utilities do not control. See &#8220;CECONY - Gas Peak Demand&#8221; in Item 1. Increases in electric and gas commodity prices may contribute to a slower recovery of cash from outstanding customer accounts receivable balances and increases to the allowance for uncollectible accounts, and may result in increases to write-offs of customer accounts receivable balances. See &#8220;Financial and Commodity Market Risks &#8211; Commodity Price Risk&#8221; in Item 7. The Clean Energy Businesses sell the output of their renewable electric projects under long-term power purchase agreements with utilities and municipalities, and a failure of the production projects could adversely affect Con Edison. 
CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2022 ##TABLE_END
The Companies May Have Substantial Unfunded Pension And Other Postretirement Benefit Liabilities. The Utilities may have substantial unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities. Significant declines in the market values of the investments held to fund pension and other postretirement benefits could trigger substantial funding requirements under governmental regulations. See &#8220;Critical Accounting Estimates &#8211; Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits&#8221; and &#8220;Financial and Commodity Market Risks&#8221; in Item 7 and Notes E and F to the financial statements in Item 8. 
Other Risks: 
The Companies Face Risks Related To Health Epidemics And Other Outbreaks, Including The COVID-19 Pandemic. Pandemic illness could potentially disrupt the Utilities' employees and contractors from providing essential utility services and the Companies' liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and continues to impact, countries, communities, supply chains and markets. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an economic slowdown in the Companies&#8217; service territories and changes in governmental and regulatory policy. The decline in business activity in the Companies&#8217; service territories has resulted in a slower recovery of cash from outstanding customer accounts receivable balances, material increases in customer accounts receivable balances, increases to the allowance for uncollectible accounts, and may result in increases to write-offs of customer accounts. Although the Utilities&#8217; NY electric and gas businesses have largely effective revenue decoupling mechanisms in place, higher unpaid accounts have impacted and could continue to impact the Companies&#8217; liquidity. See &#8220;Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Impacts&#8221; in Item 7 and &#8220;COVID-19 Regulatory Matters&#8221; in Note B. 
The Companies&#8217; Strategies May Not Be Effective To Address Changes In The External Business Environment. The failure to identify, plan and execute strategies to address changes in the external business environment could have a material adverse impact on the Companies. Con Edison seeks to provide shareholder value through continued dividend growth, supported by earnings growth in regulated utilities and contracted electric and gas assets. Changes to the competitive landscape, public policy, laws or regulations (or interpretations thereof), customer behavior or technology could significantly impact the value of the Utilities&#8217; energy delivery facilities and Con Edison Transmission's investment in electric and gas transmission projects. Such changes could also affect the Companies&#8217; opportunities to make additional investments in such assets and the potential return on the investments. The Utilities' gas delivery customers and CECONY's steam delivery customers have alternatives, such as electricity and oil. Distributed energy resources, and demand reduction and energy efficiency investments, provide ways for the energy consumers within the Utilities&#8217; service areas to manage their energy usage. The Companies expect distributed energy resources and electric alternatives to gas and steam to increase, and for gas and steam usage to decrease, as the CLCPA and the Climate Mobilization Act continue to be implemented. CECONY established a gas moratorium in March 2019 on new gas service in most of Westchester County. CECONY filed a gas planning analysis with the NYSPSC in July 2020 stating the moratorium could be lifted when increased pipeline capacity is achieved or peak demand is reduced to a level that would enable the company to lift the moratorium and that it is monitoring gas supply constraint in the New York City portion of its service territory. See ""Clean Energy Businesses,"" ""Con Edison Transmission,"" ""Environmental Matters - Clean Energy Future"" and ""Environmental Matters - Climate Change,"" &#8220;Competition&#8221; and ""CECONY - Gas Peak Demand"" in Item 1. 
The Companies Face Risks Related To Supply Chain Disruptions And Inflation. The Companies have been impacted, and expect to continue to be impacted by, global and U.S. supply chain disruptions and shortages of materials, equipment, labor and other resources that are critical to the Companies&#8217; business operations, primarily the Utilities&#8217; electric and central operations. Such disruptions and shortages have resulted in increased prices and lead times for critical orders of materials and equipment needed by the Companies in their operations, such as certain raw materials, microprocessors, semiconductors, microchips, vehicles and transformers. Long lead times for replacement parts could restrict the availability and delay the construction, maintenance or repair of items that are needed to support the Utilities' normal operations and may result in prolonged customer outages, which could in turn lead to unrecovered costs for such service interruptions. Demand for electric equipment is increasing due to utilities&#8217; efforts to meet clean energy goals and in order to prepare for more frequent extreme weather events at a time when manufacturing capacity and supply are decreasing. Prices of materials, equipment, transportation and other resources have increased as a result of these supply chain disruptions and shortages and may continue to increase as a result of inflation. Increases in inflation raise the Companies&#8217; costs for operating and capital costs and employee and retiree benefit costs in excess of the costs reflected in the Utilities&#8217; rate plans and could also increase the amount of capital that needs to be raised by the Companies and the costs of such capital. 
The Companies Also Face Other Risks That Are Beyond Their Control. The Companies&#8217; results of operations can be affected by circumstances or events that are beyond their control. Weather and energy efficiency efforts directly influence the demand for electricity, gas and steam service, and can affect the price of energy commodities. 
Terrorist or other physical attacks or acts of war could damage the Companies' facilities. Economic conditions can affect customers&#8217; demand and ability to pay for service, which could adversely affect the Companies.

Information in any item of this report as to which reference is made in this Item 1A is incorporated by reference herein. The use of such terms as &#8220;see&#8221; or &#8220;refer to&#8221; shall be deemed to incorporate at the place such term is used the information to which such reference is made. 
The Companies&#8217; businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, and that involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual operating results, cash flows and financial condition. 
The Companies have established an enterprise risk management program to identify, assess, manage and monitor its major business risks based on established criteria for the severity of an event, the likelihood of its occurrence, and the programs in place to control the event or reduce the impact. The Companies&#8217; major risks include: 
Regulatory/Compliance Risks: 
The Companies Are Extensively Regulated And Are Subject To Substantial Penalties. The Companies&#8217; operations require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental agencies. State utility regulators may seek to impose substantial penalties on the Utilities for violations of state utility laws, regulations or orders. The Utilities are also subject to recurring, independent, third-party audits with respect to these regulations and standards. In addition, the Utilities' rate plans usually include negative revenue adjustments for failing to meet certain operating and customer satisfaction standards. FERC has the authority to impose penalties on the Utilities, the Clean Energy Businesses and the projects that Con Edison Transmission invests in, which could be substantial, for violations of the Federal Power Act, the Natural Gas Act or related rules, including reliability and cyber security rules. Environmental agencies may seek penalties for failure to comply with laws, regulations or permits. The Companies may also be subject to penalties from other regulatory agencies. The Companies may be subject to new laws, regulations or other requirements or the revision or reinterpretation of such requirements, which could adversely affect them. See &#8220;Utility Regulation"", ""Competition"" and &#8220;Environmental Matters &#8211; Climate Change"" and ""Environmental Matters - Other Federal, State and Local Environmental Provisions&#8221; in Item 1, &#8220;Critical Accounting Estimates&#8221; in Item 7 and &#8220;COVID-19 Regulatory Matters&#8221; and &#8220;Other Regulatory Matters&#8221; in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. 
The Utilities&#8217; Rate Plans May Not Provide A Reasonable Return. The Utilities have rate plans approved by state utility regulators that limit the rates they can charge their customers. The rates are generally designed for, but do not guarantee, the recovery of the Utilities&#8217; cost of service (including a return on equity). See &#8220;Utility Regulation &#8211; State Utility Regulation &#8211; Rate Plans&#8221; in Item 1 and &#8220;Rate Plans&#8221; in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. Rates usually may not be changed during the specified terms of the rate plans other than to recover energy costs and limited other exceptions. The Utilities&#8217; actual costs may exceed levels provided for such costs in the rate plans (see &#8220;COVID-19 Regulatory Matters&#8221; in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8). State utility regulators can initiate proceedings to prohibit the Utilities from recovering from their customers the cost of service (including energy costs and storm restoration costs) that the regulators determine to have been imprudently incurred (see ""Other Regulatory Matters"" in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8). The Utilities have from time to time entered into settlement agreements to resolve various prudence proceedings. 
The Companies May Be Adversely Affected By Changes To The Utilities&#8217; Rate Plans. The Utilities&#8217; rate plans typically require action by regulators at their expiration dates, which may include approval of new plans with different provisions. The need to recover from customers increasing costs, taxes or state-mandated assessments or surcharges could adversely affect the Utilities&#8217; opportunity to obtain new rate plans that provide a reasonable rate of return and continue important provisions of current rate plans. The Utilities&#8217; current NY electric and gas rate plans include revenue decoupling mechanisms and their NY electric, gas and steam rate plans include provisions for the recovery of energy costs and reconciliation of the actual amount of pension and other postretirement, environmental and certain other costs to amounts reflected in rates. See &#8220;Rate Plans&#8221; in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. 
CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2021 ##TABLE_END
Operations Risks: 
The Failure Of, Or Damage To, The Companies&#8217; Facilities Could Adversely Affect The Companies. The Utilities provide electricity, gas and steam service using energy facilities, many of which are located either in, or close to, densely populated public places. See the description of the Utilities&#8217; facilities in Item 1. A failure of, or damage to, these facilities, or an error in the operation or maintenance of these facilities, could result in bodily injury or death, property damage, the release of hazardous substances or extended service interruptions. Impacts of climate change, such as sea level rise, coastal storm surge, inland flooding from intense rainfall, hurricane-strength winds and extreme heat could damage facilities and the Utilities may experience more severe consequences from attempting to operate during and after such events. The Utilities&#8217; response to such events may be perceived to be below customer expectations. The Utilities' successful implementation of their maintenance programs reduces, but does not fully protect against, damage to their facilities for which they will be held responsible and which may hinder their restoration efforts. The Utilities could be required to pay substantial amounts that may not be covered by the Utilities&#8217; insurance policies to repair or replace their facilities, compensate others for injury or death or other damage and settle any proceedings initiated by state utility regulators or other regulatory agencies. The occurrence of such events could also adversely affect the cost and availability of insurance. See &#8220;Other Regulatory Matters&#8221; in Note B and &#8220;Manhattan Explosion and Fire&#8221; in Note H to the financial statements in Item 8. Changes to laws, regulations or judicial doctrines could further expand the Utilities&#8217; liability for service interruptions. See &#8220;Utility Regulation &#8211; State Utility Regulation&#8221; and ""Environmental Matters &#8211; Climate Change"" in Item 1. 
A Cyber Attack Could Adversely Affect The Companies. The Companies and other operators of critical energy infrastructure and energy market participants face a heightened risk of cyber attack and the Companies&#8217; businesses require the continued operation of information systems and network infr astructure. See Item 1 for a description of the businesses of the Utilities, the Clean Energy Businesses and Con Edison Transmission. Cyber attacks may include hacking, viruses, malware, denial of service attacks, ransomware, exploited vulnerabilities or other security breac hes, including loss of data and communications. Cyber threats to the electric and gas systems are increasing in sophistication, magnitude and frequency. Interconnectivity with customers, independent system operators, energy traders and other energy market participants, suppliers, contractors and others also exposes the Companies&#8217; information systems and network infrastructure to an increased risk of cyber incidents, including attacks. Such interconnectivity increases the risk that a cyber incident or attack on the Companies could affect others and that a cyber incident or attack on others could affect the Companies. In the event of a cyber incident or attack that the Companies were unable to defend against or mitigate, the Companies could have their operations and the operations of their customers and others disrupted. The Companies could also have their financial and other information systems and network infrastructure impaired, property damaged, and customer and employee information stolen; experience substantial loss of revenues, response costs and other financial loss; and be subject to increased regulation, litigation, penalties and damage to their reputation. The Companies address vulnerabilities as they are identified, including the Log4j vulnerability common to web applications that was announced in December 2021. The Companies have experienced cyber incidents and attacks, although none of the incidents or attacks had a material impact. 
The Failure Of Processes and Systems And The Performance Of Employees And Contractors Could Adversely Affect The Companies. The Companies have developed business processes and use information and communication systems and enterprise platforms for operations, customer service, legal compliance, personnel, accounting, planning and other matters. The Companies have completed a multi-year, phased transition of certain information technology services, including application maintenance and support and infrastructure and operations services, to a contractor. The failure of the Companies&#8217; or its contractors' business processes or information and communication systems or the failure by the Companies&#8217; employees or contractors to follow procedures, their unsafe actions, errors or intentional misconduct, cyber incidents or attacks, or work stoppages could adversely affect the Companies&#8217; operations and liquidity and result in substantial liability, higher costs and increased regulatory requirements. The violation of laws or regulations by employees or contractors for personal gain may result from contract and procurement fraud, extortion, bribe acceptance, fraudulent related-party transactions and serious breaches of corporate policy or standards of business conduct. See &#8220;Human Capital&#8221; in Item 1. 
Environmental Risks: 
The Companies Are Exposed To Risks From The Environmental Consequences Of Their Operations. The Companies are exposed to risks relating to climate change and related matters. In 2019, CECONY completed a climate change vulnerability study and during 2020, CECONY further evaluated its future climate change adaptation strategies and developed a climate change implementation plan. NY State enacted the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act and New York City enacted the Climate Mobilization Act . See &#8220;Environmental Matters &#8211; Clean Energy Future&#8221; in Item 1. CECONY may also be impacted by regulations requiring reductions in air emissions. See &#8220;Environmental Matters &#8211; Other Federal, State and Local Environmental Provisions &#8211; Air Quality&#8221; in Item 1. In addition, the Utilities are responsible for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, PCBs and coal tar, that have been used or produced in the course of the Utilities&#8217; operations and are present on properties or in facilities 
and equipment currently or previously owned by them. See &#8220;Environmental Matters&#8221; in Item 1 and Note G to the financial statements in Item 8. The Companies could be adversely affected if a causal relationship between electric and magnetic fields and adverse health effects were to be established. 
Financial and Market Risks: 
Con Edison&#8217;s Ability To Pay Dividends Or Interest Depends On Dividends From Its Subsidiaries. Con Edison&#8217;s ability to pay dividends on its common shares or interest on its external borrowings depends primarily on the dividends and other distributions it receives from its subsidiaries. The dividends that the Utilities may pay to Con Edison are limited by the NYSPSC to not more than 100 percent of their respective income available for dividends calculated on a two-year rolling average basis, with certain exceptions. See &#8220;Dividends&#8221; in Note C and Note U to the financial statements in Item 8. 
Changes To Tax Laws Could Adversely Affect the Companies. Changes to tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof could have a material adverse impact on the Companies. Depending on the extent of these changes, the changes could also adversely impact the Companies&#8217; credit ratings and liquidity. The reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate to 21 percent under the TCJA resulted in decreased cash flows from operating activities, and requires increased cash flows from financing activities, for the Utilities. See &#8220;Capital Requirements and Resources &#8211; Capital Resources&#8221; in Item 1, &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources &#8211; Cash Flows from Operating Activities&#8221; in Item 7, ""Rate Plans"" and ""Other Regulatory Matters"" in Note B and Note L to the financial statements in Item 8. 
The Companies Require Access To Capital Markets To Satisfy Funding Requirements. The Utilities estimate that their construction expenditures will exceed $14,300 million over the next three years. The Utilities use internally-generated funds, equity contributions from Con Edison, if any, and external borrowings to fund the construction expenditures. The Clean Energy Businesses are investing in renewable generation and sustainable energy infrastructure projects that require funds in excess of those produced in the businesses. Con Edison expects to finance its capital requirements primarily through internally generated funds, the sale of its common shares or external borrowings. Changes in financial market conditions or in the Companies&#8217; credit ratings could adversely affect their ability to raise new capital and the cost thereof. See &#8220;Capital Requirements and Resources&#8221; in Item 1. 
A Disruption In The Wholesale Energy Markets Or Failure By An Energy Supplier or Customer Could Adversely Affect The Companies. &#160; Almost all the electricity and gas the Utilities sell to their full-service customers is purchased through the wholesale energy markets or pursuant to contracts with energy suppliers. See the description of the Utilities&#8217; energy supply in Item 1. A disruption in the wholesale energy markets or a failure on the part of the Utilities&#8217; energy suppliers or operators of energy delivery systems that connect to the Utilities&#8217; energy facilities could adversely affect their ability to meet their customers&#8217; energy needs and adversely affect the Companies. The Utilities' ability to gain access to additional energy supplies, if needed, depends on effective markets and siting approvals for developer projects, which the Utilities do not control. See &#8220;CECONY - Gas Peak Demand&#8221; in Item 1. The Clean Energy Businesses sell the output of their renewable electric projects under long-term power purchase agreements with utilities and municipalities, and a failure of the production projects could adversely affect Con Edison. 
The Companies Have Substantial Unfunded Pension And Other Postretirement Benefit Liabilities. The Utilities have substantial unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities. The Utilities expect to make significant contributions to their pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Significant declines in the market values of the investments held to fund pension and other postretirement benefits could trigger substantial funding requirements under governmental regulations. See &#8220;Critical Accounting Estimates &#8211; Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits&#8221; and &#8220;Financial and Commodity Market Risks&#8221; in Item 7 and Notes E and F to the financial statements in Item 8. 
CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2021 ##TABLE_END
Other Risks: 
The Companies Face Risks Related To Health Epidemics And Other Outbreaks, Including The COVID-19 Pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and continues to impact, countries, communities, supply chains and markets. During 2020, the Companies&#8217; service territories included some of the most severely impacted counties in the United States. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an economic slowdown in the Companies&#8217; service territories, decreased demand for the services that they provide and changes in governmental and regulatory policy. The decline in business activity in the Companies&#8217; service territories has resulted in a slower recovery of cash from outstanding customer accounts receivable balances, material increases in customer accounts receivable balances, increases to the allowance for uncollectible accounts, and may result in increases to write-offs of customer accounts. Although the Utilities&#8217; NY electric and gas businesses have largely effective revenue decoupling mechanisms in place, higher unpaid accounts have impacted and could continue to impact the Companies&#8217; liquidity. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Utilities have been impacted, and may continue to be impacted by, global and U.S. supply chain disruptions causing shortages of, and increased pricing pressure on, among other things, certain raw materials, labor, microprocessors and microchips. Such disruptions have resulted in increased prices and lead times for certain orders of materials and equipment needed by the Utilities in their operations. The Companies will continue to monitor developments relating to the COVID-19 pandemic; however, the Companies cannot predict the extent to which, COVID-19 may have a material impact on liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. The situation is changing rapidly and future impacts may materialize that are not yet known. Accordingly, the extent to which COVID-19 may impact these matters will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the success of vaccination efforts, the emergence of new variants and the severity thereof, actions that federal, state and local governmental or regulatory agencies may continue to take in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and other actions taken to contain it or treat its impact, among others. See &#8220;Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Impacts&#8221; in Item 7 and &#8220;COVID-19 Regulatory Matters&#8221; in Note B. 
The Companies&#8217; Strategies May Not Be Effective To Address Changes In The External Business Environment. The failure to identify, plan and execute strategies to address changes in the external business environment could have a material adverse impact on the Companies. Con Edison seeks to provide shareholder value through continued dividend growth, supported by earnings growth in regulated utilities and contracted electric and gas assets. Changes to public policy, laws or regulations (or interpretations thereof), customer behavior or technology could significantly impact the value of the Utilities&#8217; energy delivery facilities, the Clean Energy Businesses&#8217; renewable and sustainable energy infrastructure projects and Con Edison Transmission's investment in electric and gas transmission projects. Such changes could also affect the Companies&#8217; opportunities to make additional investments in such assets and the potential return on the investments. The Utilities' gas delivery customers and CECONY's steam delivery customers have alternatives, such as electricity and oil. Distributed energy resources, and demand reduction and energy efficiency investments, provide ways for the energy consumers within the Utilities&#8217; service areas to manage their energy usage. The Companies expect distributed energy resources and electric alternatives to gas and steam to increase, and for gas and steam usage to decrease, as the CLCPA and the Climate Mobilization Act continue to be implemented. CECONY established a gas moratorium in March 2019 on new gas service in most of Westchester County. CECONY filed a gas planning analysis with the NYSPSC in July 2020 stating the moratorium could be lifted when increased pipeline capacity is achieved or peak demand is reduced to a level that would enable the company to lift the moratorium and that it is monitoring gas supply constraint in the New York City portion of its service territory. See ""Clean Energy Businesses,"" ""Con Edison Transmission,"" ""Environmental Matters - Clean Energy Future"" and ""Environmental Matters - Climate Change,"" &#8220;Competition&#8221; and ""CECONY - Gas Peak Demand"" in Item 1. 
The Companies Also Face Other Risks That Are Beyond Their Control. The Companies&#8217; results of operations can be affected by circumstances or events that are beyond their control. Weather and energy efficiency efforts directly influence the demand for electricity, gas and steam service, and can affect the price of energy commodities. Terrorist or other physical attacks or acts of war could damage the Companies' facilities. Economic conditions can affect customers&#8217; demand and ability to pay for service, which could adversely affect the Companies. An inflationary economy could increase certain operating and capital costs and employee and retiree benefit costs in excess of the costs reflected in the Utilities&#8217; rate plans and could also increase the amount of capital that needs to be raised by the Companies and the costs of such capital. Supply chain disruptions can cause shortages of materials needed by the Companies in their business activities and can result in increased prices and lead times .

Information in any item of this report as to which reference is made in this Item 1A is incorporated by reference herein. The use of such terms as &#8220;see&#8221; or &#8220;refer to&#8221; shall be deemed to incorporate at the place such term is used the information to which such reference is made. 
The Companies&#8217; businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, and that involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual operating results, cash flows and financial condition. 
The Companies have established an enterprise risk management program to identify, assess, manage and monitor its major business risks based on established criteria for the severity of an event, the likelihood of its occurrence, and the programs in place to control the event or reduce the impact. The Companies&#8217; major risks include: 
Regulatory/Compliance Risks: 
The Companies Are Extensively Regulated And Are Subject To Substantial Penalties. The Companies&#8217; operations require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental agencies. State utility regulators may seek to impose substantial penalties on the Utilities for violations of state utility laws, regulations or orders. In addition, the Utilities' rate plans usually include negative revenue adjustments for failing to meet certain operating and customer satisfaction standards. In January 2021, Governor Cuomo proposed legislation that, if enacted, would establish an automatic moratorium on disconnections of residential and small business customers by the Utilities during certain states of emergency. In November 2020, the NYSPSC issued orders to show cause why substantial penalties should not be imposed on the Utilities regarding their preparation for and response to Tropical Storm Isaias and on CECONY regarding its actions and/or omissions prior to, during, and after the July 2019 power outages on the west side of Manhattan and in the Flatbush area of Brooklyn. The orders further indicated that should the NYSPSC confirm that certain alleged violations demonstrate a failure by the Utilities to continue to provide safe and adequate service, the NYSPSC would be authorized to commence a proceeding to revoke or modify the Utilities&#8217; operating certificates. See Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. FERC has the authority to impose penalties on the Utilities, the Clean Energy Businesses and the projects that Con Edison Transmission invests in, which could be substantial, for violations of the Federal Power Act, the Natural Gas Act or related rules, including reliability and cyber security rules. Environmental agencies may seek penalties for failure to comply with laws, regulations or permits. The Companies may also be subject to penalties from other regulatory agencies. The Companies may be subject to new laws, regulations or other requirements or the revision or reinterpretation of such requirements, which could adversely affect them. See &#8220;Utility Regulation"", ""Competition"" and &#8220;Environmental Matters &#8211; Climate Change"" and ""Environmental Matters - Other Federal, State and Local Environmental Provisions&#8221; in Item 1, &#8220;Application of Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; in Item 7 and &#8220;COVID-19 Regulatory Matters&#8221; and &#8220;Other Regulatory Matters&#8221; in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. 
The Utilities&#8217; Rate Plans May Not Provide A Reasonable Return. The Utilities have rate plans approved by state utility regulators that limit the rates they can charge their customers. The rates are generally designed for, but do not guarantee, the recovery of the Utilities&#8217; cost of service (including a return on equity). See &#8220;Utility Regulation &#8211; State Utility Regulation &#8211; Rate Plans&#8221; in Item 1 and &#8220;Rate Plans&#8221; in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. Rates usually may not be changed during the specified terms of the rate plans other than to recover energy costs and limited other exceptions. The Utilities&#8217; actual costs may exceed levels provided for such costs in the rate plans (see &#8220;COVID-19 Regulatory Matters&#8221; in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8). State utility regulators can initiate proceedings to prohibit the Utilities from recovering from their customers the cost of service (including energy costs and storm restoration costs) that the regulators determine to have been imprudently incurred (see ""Other Regulatory Matters"" in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8). The Utilities have from time to time entered into settlement agreements to resolve various prudence proceedings. 
The Companies May Be Adversely Affected By Changes To The Utilities&#8217; Rate Plans. The Utilities&#8217; rate plans typically require action by regulators at their expiration dates, which may include approval of new plans with different provisions. The need to recover from customers increasing costs, taxes or state-mandated assessments or surcharges could adversely affect the Utilities&#8217; opportunity to obtain new rate plans that provide a reasonable rate of return and continue important provisions of current rate plans. The Utilities&#8217; current New York electric and gas rate plans include revenue decoupling mechanisms and their New York electric, gas and steam rate plans include provisions for the recovery of energy costs and reconciliation of the actual amount of pension and other postretirement, environmental and certain other costs to amounts reflected in rates. See &#8220;Rate Plans&#8221; in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. 
CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2020 ##TABLE_END
Operations Risks: 
The Failure Of, Or Damage To, The Companies&#8217; Facilities Could Adversely Affect The Companies. The Utilities provide electricity, gas and steam service using energy facilities, many of which are located either in, or close to, densely populated public places. See the description of the Utilities&#8217; facilities in Item 1. A failure of, or damage to, these facilities, or an error in the operation or maintenance of these facilities, could result in bodily injury or death, property damage, the release of hazardous substances or extended service interruptions. Impacts of climate change, such as sea level rise, coastal storm surge, inland flooding from intense rainfall, hurricane-strength winds and extreme heat could damage facilities and the Utilities may experience more severe consequences from attempting to operate during and after such events. The Utilities&#8217; response to such events may be perceived to be below customer expectations. The Utilities could be required to pay substantial amounts that may not be covered by the Utilities&#8217; insurance policies to repair or replace their facilities, compensate others for injury or death or other damage and settle any proceedings initiated by state utility regulators or other regulatory agencies. The occurrence of such events could also adversely affect the cost and availability of insurance. See &#8220;Other Regulatory Matters&#8221; in Note B and &#8220;Manhattan Explosion and Fire&#8221; in Note H to the financial statements in Item 8. Changes to laws, regulations or judicial doctrines could further expand the Utilities&#8217; liability for service interruptions. See &#8220;Utility Regulation &#8211; State Utility Regulation&#8221; and ""Environmental Matters &#8211; Climate Change"" in Item 1. 
A Cyber Attack Could Adversely Affect The Companies. The Companies and other operators of critical energy infrastructure and energy market participants face a heightened risk of cyber attack and the Companies&#8217; businesses require the continued operation of information systems and network infrastructure. See Item 1 for a description of the businesses of the Utilities, the Clean Energy Businesses and Con Edison Transmission. Cyber attacks may include hacking, viruses, malware, denial of service attacks, ransomware or other security breaches, including loss of data. Cyber threats to the electric and gas systems are increasing in sophistication, magnitude and frequency. There has been a growing use of COVID-19 related themes by malicious cyber actors and the significant increase in employees working remotely has increased the attack surface area for the Companies as well as their contractors and vendors .Interconnectivity with customers through advanced metering infrastructure, independent system operators, energy traders and other energy market participants, suppliers, contractors and others also exposes the Companies&#8217; information systems and network infrastructure to an increased risk of cyber incidents, including attacks, and increases the risk that a cyber incident or attack on the Companies could affect others. In the event of a cyber incident or attack that the Companies were unable to defend against or mitigate, the Companies could have their operations and the operations of their customers and others disrupted. The Companies could also have their financial and other information systems and network infrastructure impaired, property damaged, and customer and employee information stolen; experience substantial loss of revenues, response costs and other financial loss; and be subject to increased regulation, litigation, penalties and damage to their reputation. In December 2020, it was announced that updates from SolarWinds, a network monitoring tool used by CECONY, O&#38;R and the Clean Energy Businesses, was compromised and facilitated a cyberattack against multiple private and public sector entities. The Companies have experienced cyber incidents and attacks, including the recent SolarWinds attack, although none of the incidents or attacks had a material impact. 
The Failure Of Processes and Systems And The Performance Of Employees And Contractors Could Adversely Affect The Companies. The Companies have developed business processes and use information and communication systems for operations, customer service, legal compliance, personnel, accounting, planning and other matters. The Companies have completed a multi-year, phased transition of information technology services, including application maintenance and support and infrastructure and operations services, to a contractor. The failure of the Companies&#8217; or its contractors' business processes or information and communication systems or the failure by the Companies&#8217; employees or contractors to follow procedures, their unsafe actions, errors or intentional misconduct, cyber incidents or attacks, or work stoppages could adversely affect the Companies&#8217; operations and liquidity and result in substantial liability, higher costs and increased regulatory requirements. The violation of laws or regulations by employees or contractors for personal gain may result from contract and procurement fraud, extortion, bribe acceptance, fraudulent related-party transactions and serious breaches of corporate policy or standards of business conduct. See &#8220;Human Capital&#8221; in Item 1. 
Environmental Risks: 
The Companies Are Exposed To Risks From The Environmental Consequences Of Their Operations. The Companies are exposed to risks relating to climate change and related matters. In 2019, CECONY completed a climate change vulnerability study and during 2020, CECONY further evaluated its future climate change adaptation strategies and developed a climate change implementation plan. New York State enacted the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act and New York City enacted the Climate Mobilization Act . See &#8220;Environmental Matters &#8211; Clean Energy Future&#8221; in Item 1. CECONY may also be impacted by regulations requiring reductions in air emissions. See &#8220;Environmental Matters &#8211; Other Federal, State and Local Environmental Provisions &#8211; Air Quality&#8221; in Item 1. In addition, the Utilities are responsible for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, PCBs and coal tar, that 
have been used or produced in the course of the Utilities&#8217; operations and are present on properties or in facilities and equipment currently or previously owned by them. See &#8220;Environmental Matters&#8221; in Item 1 and Note G to the financial statements in Item 8. The Companies could be adversely affected if a causal relationship between electric and magnetic fields and adverse health effects were to be established. 
Financial and Market Risks: 
A Disruption In The Wholesale Energy Markets Or Failure By An Energy Supplier or Customer Could Adversely Affect The Companies. &#160; Almost all the electricity and gas the Utilities sell to their full-service customers is purchased through the wholesale energy markets or pursuant to contracts with energy suppliers. See the description of the Utilities&#8217; energy supply in Item 1. A disruption in the wholesale energy markets or a failure on the part of the Utilities&#8217; energy suppliers or operators of energy delivery systems that connect to the Utilities&#8217; energy facilities could adversely affect their ability to meet their customers&#8217; energy needs and adversely affect the Companies. The Utilities' ability to gain access to additional energy supplies, if needed, depends on effective markets and siting approvals for developer projects, which the Utilities do not control. See &#8220;CECONY - Gas Peak Demand&#8221; in Item 1. The Clean Energy Businesses sell the output of their renewable electric production projects under long-term power purchase agreements with utilities and municipalities, and a failure of the production projects could adversely affect Con Edison. 
The Companies Have Substantial Unfunded Pension And Other Postretirement Benefit Liabilities. The Utilities have substantial unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities. The Utilities expect to make substantial contributions to their pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Significant declines in the market values of the investments held to fund pension and other postretirement benefits could trigger substantial funding requirements under governmental regulations. See &#8220;Application of Critical Accounting Policies &#8211; Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits&#8221; and &#8220;Financial and Commodity Market Risks&#8221; in Item 7 and Notes E and F to the financial statements in Item 8. 
Con Edison&#8217;s Ability To Pay Dividends Or Interest Depends On Dividends From Its Subsidiaries. Con Edison&#8217;s ability to pay dividends on its common stock or interest on its external borrowings depends primarily on the dividends and other distributions it receives from its subsidiaries. The dividends that the Utilities may pay to Con Edison are limited by the NYSPSC to not more than 100 percent of their respective income available for dividends calculated on a two-year rolling average basis, with certain exceptions. See &#8220;Dividends&#8221; in Note C and Note T to the financial statements in Item 8. 
The Companies Require Access To Capital Markets To Satisfy Funding Requirements. The Utilities estimate that their construction expenditures will exceed $10,800 million over the next three years. The Utilities use internally-generated funds, equity contributions from Con Edison, if any, and external borrowings to fund the construction expenditures. The Clean Energy Businesses are investing in renewable generation and sustainable energy infrastructure projects that require funds in excess of those produced in the businesses. Con Edison expects to finance its capital requirements primarily through internally generated funds, the sale of its common shares or external borrowings. Changes in financial market conditions or in the Companies&#8217; credit ratings could adversely affect their ability to raise new capital and the cost thereof. See &#8220;Capital Requirements and Resources&#8221; in Item 1. 
Changes To Tax Laws Could Adversely Affect the Companies. Changes to tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof could have a material adverse impact on the Companies. Depending on the extent of these changes, the changes could also adversely impact the Companies&#8217; credit ratings and liquidity. The reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate to 21 percent under the TCJA resulted in decreased cash flows from operating activities, and requires increased cash flows from financing activities, for the Utilities. See &#8220;Capital Requirements and Resources &#8211; Capital Resources&#8221; in Item 1, &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources &#8211; Cash Flows from Operating Activities&#8221; in Item 7, ""Rate Plans"" and ""Other Regulatory Matters"" in Note B and Note L to the financial statements in Item 8.

Other Risks: 
The Companies Face Risks Related To Health Epidemics And Other Outbreaks, Including The COVID-19 Pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and continues to impact, countries, communities, supply chains and markets. During 2020, the Companies&#8217; service territories included some of the most severely impacted counties in the United States. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an economic slowdown in the Companies&#8217; service territories, decreased demand for the services that they provide and changes in governmental and regulatory policy. The decline in business activity in the Companies&#8217; service territories has resulted in lower billed sales revenues and increased difficulty of customers to pay bills. Although the Utilities&#8217; New York electric and gas businesses have largely effective revenue decoupling mechanisms in place, lower billed sales revenues and higher uncollectible accounts have impacted and could continue to impact the Companies&#8217; liquidity. The Utilities have also suspended service disconnections, new late payment charges and certain other fees for customers, which may result in a further increase to bad debt expense. The Companies will continue to monitor developments relating to the COVID-19 pandemic; however, the Companies cannot predict the extent to which, COVID-19 may have a material impact on liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. The situation is changing rapidly and future impacts may materialize that are not yet known. Accordingly, the extent to which COVID-19 may impact these matters will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the success of vaccination efforts, actions that federal, state and local governmental or regulatory agencies may continue to take in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and other actions taken to contain it or treat its impact, among others. See &#8220;Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Impacts&#8221; in Item 7 and &#8220;COVID-19 Regulatory Matters&#8221; in Note B. 
The Companies&#8217; Strategies May Not Be Effective To Address Changes In The External Business Environment. The failure to identify, plan and execute strategies to address changes in the external business environment could have a material adverse impact on the Companies. Con Edison seeks to provide shareholder value through continued dividend growth, supported by earnings growth in regulated utilities and contracted electric and gas assets. Changes to public policy, laws or regulations (or interpretations thereof), customer behavior or technology could significantly impact the value of the Utilities&#8217; energy delivery facilities, the Clean Energy Businesses&#8217; renewable and sustainable energy infrastructure projects and Con Edison Transmission's investment in electric and gas transmission projects. Such changes could also affect the Companies&#8217; opportunities to make additional investments in such assets and the potential return on the investments. The Utilities' gas delivery customers and CECONY's steam delivery customers have alternatives, such as electricity and oil. Distributed energy resources, and demand reduction and energy efficiency investments, provide ways for the energy consumers within the Utilities&#8217; service areas to manage their energy usage. The Companies expect distributed energy resources and electric alternatives to gas and steam to increase, and for gas and steam usage to decrease, as the CLCPA and the Climate Mobilization Act continue to be implemented. CECONY established a gas moratorium in March 2019 on new gas service in most of Westchester County. CECONY filed a gas planning analysis with the NYSPSC in July 2020 stating the moratorium could be lifted when increased pipeline capacity is achieved or peak demand is reduced to a level that would enable the company to lift the moratorium and that it is monitoring gas supply constraint in the New York City portion of its service territory. See ""Clean Energy Businesses,"" ""Con Edison Transmission,"" ""Environmental Matters - Clean Energy Future"" and ""Environmental Matters - Climate Change,"" &#8220;Competition&#8221; and ""CECONY - Gas Peak Demand"" in Item 1. 
The Companies Also Face Other Risks That Are Beyond Their Control. The Companies&#8217; results of operations can be affected by circumstances or events that are beyond their control. Weather and energy efficiency efforts directly influence the demand for electricity, gas and steam service, and can affect the price of energy commodities. Terrorist or other physical attacks or acts of war could damage the Companies' facilities. Economic conditions can affect customers&#8217; demand and ability to pay for service, which could adversely affect the Companies.

Information in any item of this report as to which reference is made in this Item 1A is incorporated by reference herein. The use of such terms as &#8220;see&#8221; or &#8220;refer to&#8221; shall be deemed to incorporate at the place such term is used the information to which such reference is made. 
The Companies&#8217; businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, and that involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual operating results, cash flows and financial condition. 
The Companies have established an enterprise risk management program to identify, assess, manage and monitor its major business risks based on established criteria for the severity of an event, the likelihood of its occurrence, and the programs in place to control the event or reduce the impact. The Companies&#8217; major risks include: 
Regulatory/Compliance Risks: 
The Companies Are Extensively Regulated And Are Subject To Penalties. The Companies&#8217; operations require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental agencies. State utility regulators may seek to impose substantial penalties on the Utilities for violations of state utility laws, regulations or orders. In addition, the Utilities' rate plans usually include negative revenue adjustments for failing to meet certain operating and customer satisfaction standards. See Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. FERC has the authority to impose penalties on the Utilities, the Clean Energy Businesses and the projects that Con Edison Transmission invests in, which could be substantial, for violations of the Federal Power Act, the Natural Gas Act or related rules, including reliability and cyber security rules. Environmental agencies may seek penalties for failure to comply with laws, regulations or permits. The Companies may also be subject to penalties from other regulatory agencies. The Companies may be subject to new laws, regulations or other requirements or the revision or reinterpretation of such requirements, which could adversely affect them. The NYSPSC has an ongoing REV proceeding to improve system efficiency and reliability, encourage renewable energy resources, support distributed energy resources and empower customer choice. See &#8220;Utility Regulation"", ""Competition"" and &#8220;Environmental Matters &#8211; Climate Change"" and ""Environmental Matters - Other Federal, State and Local Environmental Provisions&#8221; in Item 1 and &#8220;Application of Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; in Item 7. 
The Utilities&#8217; Rate Plans May Not Provide A Reasonable Return. The Utilities have rate plans approved by state utility regulators that limit the rates they can charge their customers. The rates are generally designed for, but do not guarantee, the recovery of the Utilities&#8217; cost of service (including a return on equity). See &#8220;Utility Regulation &#8211; State Utility Regulation &#8211; Rate Plans&#8221; in Item 1 and &#8220;Rate Plans&#8221; in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. Rates usually may not be changed during the specified terms of the rate plans other than to recover energy costs and limited other exceptions. The Utilities&#8217; actual costs may exceed levels provided for such costs in the rate plans. State utility regulators can initiate proceedings to prohibit the Utilities from recovering from their customers the cost of service (including energy costs) that the regulators determine to have been imprudently incurred (see ""Other 
CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2019 
Regulatory Matters"" in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8). The Utilities have from time to time entered into settlement agreements to resolve various prudence proceedings. 
The Companies May Be Adversely Affected By Changes To The Utilities&#8217; Rate Plans. The Utilities&#8217; rate plans typically require action by regulators at their expiration dates, which may include approval of new plans with different provisions. The need to recover from customers increasing costs, taxes or state-mandated assessments or surcharges could adversely affect the Utilities&#8217; opportunity to obtain new rate plans that provide a reasonable rate of return and continue important provisions of current rate plans. The Utilities&#8217; current New York electric and gas rate plans include revenue decoupling mechanisms and their New York electric, gas and steam rate plans include provisions for the recovery of energy costs and reconciliation of the actual amount of pension and other postretirement, environmental and certain other costs to amounts reflected in rates. See &#8220;Rate Plans&#8221; in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. 
Operations Risks: 
The Failure of, or Damage to, the Companies&#8217; Facilities Could Adversely Affect the Companies. The Utilities provide electricity, gas and steam service using energy facilities, many of which are located either in, or close to, densely populated public places. See the description of the Utilities&#8217; facilities in Item 1. A failure of, or damage to, these facilities, or an error in the operation or maintenance of these facilities, could result in bodily injury or death, property damage, the release of hazardous substances or extended service interruptions. Impacts of climate change, such as sea level rise, coastal storm surge, inland flooding from intense rainfall, hurricane-strength winds and extreme heat could damage facilities and the Utilities may experience more severe consequences from attempting to operate during and after such events. The Utilities&#8217; response to such events may be perceived to be below customer expectations. The Utilities could be required to pay substantial amounts that may not be covered by the Utilities&#8217; insurance policies to repair or replace their facilities, compensate others for injury or death or other damage and settle any proceedings initiated by state utility regulators or other regulatory agencies. The occurrence of such events could also adversely affect the cost and availability of insurance. See &#8220;Other Regulatory Matters&#8221; in Note B and &#8220;Manhattan Explosion and Fire&#8221; in Note H to the financial statements in Item 8. Changes to laws, regulations or judicial doctrines could further expand the Utilities&#8217; liability for service interruptions. See &#8220;Utility Regulation &#8211; State Utility Regulation&#8221; and ""Environmental Matters &#8211; Climate Change"" in Item 1. 
A Cyber Attack Could Adversely Affect the Companies. The Companies and other operators of critical energy infrastructure and energy market participants face a heightened risk of cyber attack. Cyber attacks may include hacking, viruses, malware, denial of service attacks, ransomware or other data security breaches. The U.S. Department of Energy's Quadrennial Energy Review, issued in January 2017, indicated that cyber threats to the electricity system are increasing in sophistication, magnitude and frequency. The Companies&#8217; businesses require the continued operation of information systems and network infrastructure. See Item 1 for a description of the businesses of the Utilities, the Clean Energy Businesses and Con Edison Transmission. Interconnectivity with customers through advanced metering infrastructure, independent system operators, energy traders and other energy market participants, suppliers, contractors and others exposes the Companies&#8217; information systems and network infrastructure to an increased risk of cyber attack and increases the risk that a cyber attack on the Companies could affect others. In 2019, the NYSPSC issued an order requiring third parties that access customer and utility system data to meet the utilities' minimum cyber requirements and to protect customer information. In the event of a cyber attack that the Companies were unable to defend against or mitigate, the Companies could have their operations and the operations of their customers and others disrupted. The Companies could also have their financial and other information systems and network infrastructure impaired, property damaged and customer and employee information stolen; experience substantial loss of revenues, response costs and other financial loss; and be subject to increased regulation, litigation, penalties and damage to their reputation. The Companies have experienced cyber attacks, although none of the attacks had a material impact. 
The Failure of Processes and Systems and the Performance of Employees and Contractors Could Adversely Affect the Companies. The Companies have developed business processes and use information and communication systems for operations, customer service, legal compliance, personnel, accounting, planning and other matters. The Companies have commenced a multi-year, phased transition of information technology services, including application maintenance and support and infrastructure and operations services, to a contractor. The failure of the Companies&#8217; or its contractors' business processes or information and communication systems or the failure by the Companies&#8217; employees or contractors to follow procedures, their unsafe actions, errors or intentional misconduct, or work stoppages could adversely affect the Companies&#8217; operations and liquidity and result in substantial liability, higher costs and increased regulatory requirements. The violation of laws or regulations by employees or contractors for personal gain may result from contract and procurement fraud, extortion, bribe acceptance, fraudulent related-party transactions and serious breaches of corporate policy or standards of business conduct. See &#8220;Employees&#8221; in Item 1. 
Environmental Risks: 
The Companies Are Exposed to Risks From The Environmental Consequences Of Their Operations. The Companies are exposed to risks relating to climate change and related matters. In 2019, CECONY completed a climate change vulnerability study. New York State enacted the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act and New York City enacted the Climate Mobilization Act . See &#8220;Environmental Matters &#8211; Climate Change&#8221; in Item 1. CECONY may also be impacted by regulations requiring reductions in air emissions. See &#8220;Environmental Matters &#8211; Other Federal, State and Local Environmental Provisions &#8211; Air Quality&#8221; in Item 1. In addition, the Utilities are responsible for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, PCBs and coal tar, that have been used or produced in the course of the Utilities&#8217; operations and are present on properties or in facilities and equipment currently or previously owned by them. See &#8220;Environmental Matters&#8221; in Item 1 and Note G to the financial statements in Item 8. The Companies could be adversely affected if a causal relationship between electric and magnetic fields and adverse health effects were to be established. 
Financial and Market Risks: 
A Disruption In The Wholesale Energy Markets Or Failure By An Energy Supplier or Customer Could Adversely Affect The Companies. &#160; Almost all the electricity and gas the Utilities sell to their full-service customers is purchased through the wholesale energy markets or pursuant to contracts with energy suppliers. See the description of the Utilities&#8217; energy supply in Item 1. A disruption in the wholesale energy markets or a failure on the part of the Utilities&#8217; energy suppliers or operators of energy delivery systems that connect to the Utilities&#8217; energy facilities could adversely affect their ability to meet their customers&#8217; energy needs and adversely affect the Companies. The Utilities' ability to gain access to additional energy supplies, if needed, depends on effective markets and siting approvals for developer projects, which the Utilities do not control. See &#8220;CECONY - Gas Peak Demand&#8221; in Item 1. The Clean Energy Businesses sell the output of their renewable electric production projects under long-term power purchase agreements with utilities and municipalities, and a failure of the production projects could adversely affect Con Edison. In January 2019, PG&#38;E filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The output of certain of the Clean Energy Businesses' renewable electric production projects with an aggregate generating capacity of 680 MW (AC) is sold under long-term contracts to PG&#38;E. See &#8220;Clean Energy Businesses - Renewable Electric Generation,&#8221; in Item 1 and &#8220;Long-Lived and Intangible Assets&#8221; in Note A and ""Long-term Debt"" in Note C to the financial statements in Item 8. 
The Companies Have Substantial Unfunded Pension And Other Postretirement Benefit Liabilities. The Utilities have substantial unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities. The Utilities expect to make substantial contributions to their pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Significant declines in the market values of the investments held to fund pension and other postretirement benefits could trigger substantial funding requirements under governmental regulations. See &#8220;Application of Critical Accounting Policies &#8211; Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits&#8221; and &#8220;Financial and Commodity Market Risks&#8221; in Item 7 and Notes E and F to the financial statements in Item 8. 
Con Edison&#8217;s Ability To Pay Dividends Or Interest Depends On Dividends From Its Subsidiaries. Con Edison&#8217;s ability to pay dividends on its common stock or interest on its external borrowings depends primarily on the dividends and other distributions it receives from its subsidiaries. The dividends that the Utilities may pay to Con Edison are limited by the NYSPSC to not more than 100 percent of their respective income available for dividends calculated on a two-year rolling average basis, with certain exceptions. See &#8220;Dividends&#8221; in Note C and Note S to the financial statements in Item 8. 
The Companies Require Access To Capital Markets To Satisfy Funding Requirements. The Utilities estimate that their construction expenditures will exceed $ 10,300 million over the next three years. The Utilities use internally-generated funds, equity contributions from Con Edison, if any, and external borrowings to fund the construction expenditures. The Clean Energy Businesses are investing in renewable generation and energy infrastructure projects that require funds in excess of those produced in the businesses. Con Edison expects to finance its capital requirements primarily through internally generated funds, the sale of its common shares or external borrowings. Changes in financial market conditions or in the Companies&#8217; credit ratings could adversely affect their ability to raise new capital and the cost thereof. See &#8220;Capital Requirements and Resources&#8221; in Item 1. 
Changes To Tax Laws Could Adversely Affect the Companies. Changes to tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof could have a material adverse impact on the Companies. Depending on the extent of these changes, the changes could also adversely impact the Companies&#8217; credit ratings. The reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate to 21 percent under the TCJA has resulted in decreased cash flows from operating activities, and requires increased cash flows from financing activities, for the Utilities. See &#8220;Capital Requirements and Resources &#8211; Capital Resources&#8221; in Item 1, &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources &#8211; Cash Flows from Operating 
CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2019 
Activities&#8221; in Item 7, ""Rate Plans"" and ""Other Regulatory Matters"" in Note B and Note L to the financial statements in Item 8. 
Other Risks: 
The Companies&#8217; Strategies May Not Be Effective To Address Changes In The External Business Environment. The failure to identify, plan and execute strategies to address changes in the external business environment could have a material adverse impact on the Companies. Con Edison seeks to provide shareholder value through continued dividend growth, supported by earnings growth in regulated utilities and contracted electric and gas assets. Changes to public policy, laws or regulations (or interpretations thereof), customer behavior or technology could significantly impact the value of the Utilities&#8217; energy delivery facilities, the Clean Energy Businesses&#8217; renewable and energy infrastructure projects and Con Edison Transmission's investment in electric and gas transmission projects. Such changes could also affect the Companies&#8217; opportunities to make additional investments in such assets and the potential return on the investments. See &#8220;Utility Regulation &#8211; State Utility Regulation &#8211; New York Utility Industry &#8211; Reforming the Energy Vision,&#8221; ""Clean Energy Businesses,"" ""Con Edison Transmission,"" ""Environmental Matters - Climate Change"" and &#8220;Competition&#8221; in Item 1. 
The Companies Also Face Other Risks That Are Beyond Their Control. The Companies&#8217; results of operations can be affected by circumstances or events that are beyond their control. Weather directly influences the demand for electricity, gas and steam service, and can affect the price of energy commodities. Terrorist or other physical attacks or acts of war could damage the Companies' facilities. Economic conditions can affect customers&#8217; demand and ability to pay for service, which could adversely affect the Companies.

Environmental agencies may seek penalties for failure to comply with laws, regulations or permits. The Companies may also be subject to penalties from other regulatory agencies. The Companies may be subject to new laws, regulations or other requirements or the revision or reinterpretation of such requirements, which could adversely affect them. In April 2014, the NYSPSC instituted its REV proceeding to improve system efficiency and reliability, encourage renewable energy resources, support distributed energy resources and empower customer choice. See &#8220;Utility Regulation&#8221; and &#8220;Environmental Matters &#8211; Climate Change and Other Federal, State and Local Environmental Provisions&#8221; in Item 1 and &#8220;Application of Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; in Item 7.

See &#8220;Rate Plans&#8221; and ""Other Regulatory Matters"" in Note B &#32;to the financial statements in Item 8. 
The Intentional Misconduct of Employees or Contractors Could Adversely Affect the Companies. The violation of laws or regulations by employees or contractors for personal gain may result from contract and procurement fraud, extortion, bribe acceptance, fraudulent related-party transactions and serious breaches of corporate policy or standards of business conduct. Such intentional misconduct by employees or contractors could result in substantial liability, higher costs and increased regulatory requirements. See &#8220;Employees&#8221; in Item 1.

Changes to laws, regulations or judicial doctrines could further expand the Utilities&#8217; liability for service interruptions. See &#8220;Utility Regulation &#8211; State Utility Regulation&#8221; and ""Environmental Matters"" in Item 1. 
A Cyber Attack Could Adversely Affect the Companies. The Companies and other operators of critical energy infrastructure and energy market participants face a heightened risk of cyber attack. Cyber attacks may include hacking, viruses, malware, denial of service attacks, ransomware or other data security breaches. The U.S. Department of Energy's Quadrennial Energy Review, issued in January 2017, indicated that cyber threats to the electricity system are increasing in sophistication, magnitude and frequency. The Companies&#8217; businesses require the continued operation of information systems and network infrastructure. See Item 1 for a description of the businesses of the Utilities, the Clean Energy Businesses and Con Edison Transmission. Interconnectivity with customers, independent system operators, energy traders and other energy market participants, suppliers, contractors and others exposes the Companies&#8217; information systems and network infrastructure to an increased risk of cyber attack and increases the risk that a cyber attack on the Companies could affect others. In the event of a cyber attack that the Companies were unable to defend against or mitigate, the Companies could have their operations and the operations of their customers and others disrupted. The Companies could also have their financial and other information systems and network infrastructure impaired, property damaged and customer and employee information stolen; experience substantial loss of revenues, response costs and other financial loss; and be subject to increased regulation, litigation, penalties and damage to their reputation. The Companies have experienced cyber attacks, although none of the attacks had a material impact. 
Environmental Risks: 
The Companies Are Exposed to Risks From The Environmental Consequences Of Their Operations. The Companies are exposed to risks relating to climate change and related matters. See &#8220;Environmental Matters &#8211; Climate Change&#8221; in Item 1. CECONY may also be impacted by regulations requiring reductions in air emissions. See &#8220;Environmental Matters &#8211; Other Federal, State and Local Environmental Provisions &#8211; Air Quality&#8221; in Item 1. In addition, the Utilities are responsible for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, PCBs and coal tar, that have been used or produced in the course of the Utilities&#8217; operations and are present on properties or in facilities and equipment currently or previously owned by them. See &#8220;Environmental Matters&#8221; in Item 1 and Note G &#32;to the financial statements in Item 8. The Companies could be adversely affected if a causal relationship between electric and magnetic fields and adverse health effects were to be established. 
Financial and Market Risks: 
A Disruption In The Wholesale Energy Markets Or Failure By An Energy Supplier or Customer Could Adversely Affect The Companies. &#160; Almost all the electricity and gas the Utilities sell to their full-service customers is purchased through the wholesale energy markets or pursuant to contracts with energy suppliers. See the description of the Utilities&#8217; energy supply in Item 1. A disruption in the wholesale energy markets or a failure on the part of the Utilities&#8217; energy suppliers or operators of energy delivery systems that connect to the Utilities&#8217; energy facilities could adversely affect their ability to meet their customers&#8217; energy needs and adversely affect the Companies. The Utilities' ability to gain access to additional energy supplies, if needed, is dependent on effective markets and siting approvals for developer projects, which the Utilities do not control. See &#8220;CECONY - Gas Peak Demand&#8221; in Item 1.The output of most of the Clean Energy Businesses&#8217; renewable electric production projects is sold under long-term power purchase agreements with utilities and municipalities, and a failure on their part could adversely affect Con Edison. In January 2019, PG&#38;E filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The output of Con Edison Development renewable electric production projects with an aggregate generating capacity of 680 MW (AC) is sold under PG&#38;E PPAs. See &#8220;Clean Energy Businesses - Con Edison Development,&#8221; in Item 1 and &#8220;Long-Lived and Intangible Assets&#8221; in Note A and ""Long-term Debt"" in Note C to the financial statements in Item 8. 
The Companies Have Substantial Unfunded Pension And Other Postretirement Benefit Liabilities. The Utilities have substantial unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities. The Utilities expect to make substantial contributions to their pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Significant declines in the market values of the investments held to fund pension and other postretirement benefits could trigger substantial funding requirements under governmental regulations. See &#8220;Application of Critical Accounting Policies &#8211; Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits&#8221; and &#8220;Financial and Commodity Market Risks&#8221; in Item 7 and Notes E &#32;and F &#32;to the financial statements in Item 8. 
Con Edison&#8217;s Ability To Pay Dividends Or Interest Depends On Dividends From Its Subsidiaries. Con Edison&#8217;s ability to pay dividends on its common stock or interest on its external borrowings depends primarily on the dividends and other distributions it receives from its subsidiaries. The dividends that the Utilities may pay to Con Edison are limited by the NYSPSC to not more than 100 percent of their respective income available for dividends calculated on a two-year rolling average basis, with certain exceptions. See &#8220;Dividends&#8221; in Note C and Note S to the financial statements in Item 8. 
CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2018 
The Companies Require Access To Capital Markets To Satisfy Funding Requirements. The Utilities estimate that their construction expenditures will exceed $ 10,800 million &#32;over the next three years. The Utilities use internally-generated funds, equity contributions from Con Edison, if any, and external borrowings to fund the construction expenditures. The Clean Energy Businesses and Con Edison Transmission are investing in renewable generation and energy infrastructure projects that require funds in excess of those produced in the businesses. Con Edison expects to finance its capital requirements primarily through internally generated funds, the sale of its common shares or external borrowings. Changes in financial market conditions or in the Companies&#8217; credit ratings could adversely affect their ability to raise new capital and the cost thereof. See &#8220;Capital Requirements and Resources&#8221; in Item 1. 
Changes To Tax Laws Could Adversely Affect the Companies. Changes to tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof could have a material adverse impact on the Companies. The reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate to 21 percent under the TCJA results in decreased cash flows from operating activities, and requires increased cash flows from financing activities, for the Utilities. Depending on the extent of these changes in cash flows, the changes could adversely impact the Companies&#8217; credit ratings. See &#8220;Capital Requirements and Resources &#8211; Capital Resources&#8221; in Item 1, &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources &#8211; Cash Flows from Operating Activities&#8221; in Item 7, ""Other Regulatory Matters"" in Note B and Note L to the financial statements in Item 8. 
Other Risks: 
The Companies&#8217; Strategies May Not Be Effective To Address Changes In The External Business Environment. The failure to identify, plan and execute strategies to address changes in the external business environment could have a material adverse impact on the Companies. Con Edison seeks to provide shareholder value through continued dividend growth, supported by earnings growth in regulated utilities and contracted assets. Changes to public policy, laws or regulations (or interpretations thereof), customer behavior or technology could significantly impact the value of the Utilities&#8217; energy delivery facilities, the Clean Energy Businesses&#8217; renewable and energy infrastructure projects and Con Edison Transmission's investment in electric and gas transmission projects. Such changes could also affect the Companies&#8217; opportunities to make additional investments in such assets and the potential return on the investments. See &#8220;Utility Regulation &#8211; State Utility Regulation &#8211; New York Utility Industry &#8211; Reforming the Energy Vision,&#8221; ""Environmental Matters - Climate Change"" and &#8220;Competition&#8221; in Item 1. 
The Companies Also Face Other Risks That Are Beyond Their Control. The Companies&#8217; results of operations can be affected by circumstances or events that are beyond their control. Weather directly influences the demand for electricity, gas and steam service, and can affect the price of energy commodities. Terrorist or other physical attacks or acts of war could damage the Companies' facilities. Economic conditions can affect customers&#8217; demand and ability to pay for service, which could adversely affect the Companies.

Information in any item of this report as to which reference is made in this Item 1A is incorporated by reference herein. The use of such terms as &#8220;see&#8221; or &#8220;refer to&#8221; shall be deemed to incorporate at the place such term is used the information to which such reference is made. 
The Companies&#8217; businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, and that involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual operating results, cash flows and financial condition. 
The Companies have established an enterprise risk management program to identify, assess, manage and monitor its major business risks based on established criteria for the severity of an event, the likelihood of its occurrence, and the programs in place to control the event or reduce the impact. The Companies&#8217; major risks include: 
CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2017 
Regulatory/Compliance Risks: 
The Companies Are Extensively Regulated And Are Subject To Penalties. The Companies&#8217; operations require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental agencies. State utility regulators may seek to impose substantial penalties on the Utilities for violations of state utility laws, regulations or orders. In addition, the Utilities' rate plans usually include penalties for failing to meet certain operating and customer satisfaction standards. See Note B &#32;to the financial statements in Item 8. FERC has the authority to impose penalties on the Utilities and the Clean Energy Businesses, which could be substantial, for violations of the Federal Power Act, the Natural Gas Act or related rules, including reliability and cyber security rules. Environmental agencies may seek penalties for failure to comply with laws, regulations or permits. The Companies may also be subject to penalties from other regulatory agencies. The Companies may be subject to new laws, regulations or other requirements or the revision or reinterpretation of such requirements, which could adversely affect them. In April 2014, the NYSPSC instituted its REV proceeding to improve system efficiency and reliability, encourage renewable energy resources, support distributed energy resources and empower customer choice. See &#8220;Utility Regulation&#8221; and &#8220;Environmental Matters &#8211; Climate Change and Other Federal, State and Local Environmental Provisions&#8221; in Item 1 and &#8220;Application of Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; in Item 7. 
The Utilities&#8217; Rate Plans May Not Provide A Reasonable Return. The Utilities have rate plans approved by state utility regulators that limit the rates they can charge their customers. The rates are generally designed for, but do not guarantee, the recovery of the Utilities&#8217; cost of service (including a return on equity). See &#8220;Utility Regulation &#8211; State Utility Regulation &#8211; Rate Plans&#8221; in Item 1 and &#8220;Rate Plans&#8221; in Note B &#32;to the financial statements in Item 8. Rates usually may not be changed during the specified terms of the rate plans other than to recover energy costs and limited other exceptions. The Utilities&#8217; actual costs may exceed levels provided for such costs in the rate plans. State utility regulators can initiate proceedings to prohibit the Utilities from recovering from their customers the cost of service (including energy costs) that the regulators determine to have been imprudently incurred (see ""Other Regulatory Matters"" in Note B &#32;to the financial statements in Item 8). The Utilities have from time to time entered into settlement agreements to resolve various prudence proceedings. 
The Companies May Be Adversely Affected By Changes To The Utilities&#8217; Rate Plans. The Utilities&#8217; rate plans typically require action by regulators at their expiration dates, which may include approval of new plans with different provisions. The need to recover from customers increasing costs, taxes or state-mandated assessments or surcharges could adversely affect the Utilities&#8217; opportunity to obtain new rate plans that provide a reasonable rate of return and continue important provisions of current rate plans. The Utilities&#8217; current New York electric and gas rate plans include revenue decoupling mechanisms and their New York electric, gas and steam rate plans include provisions for the recovery of energy costs and reconciliation of the actual amount of pension and other postretirement, environmental and certain other costs to amounts reflected in rates. See &#8220;Rate Plans&#8221; and ""Other Regulatory Matters"" in Note B &#32;to the financial statements in Item 8. 
The Intentional Misconduct of Employees or Contractors Could Adversely Affect the Companies. The violation of laws or regulations by employees or contractors for personal gain may result from contract and procurement fraud, extortion, bribe acceptance, fraudulent related-party transactions and serious breaches of corporate policy or standards of business conduct. Such intentional misconduct by employees or contractors could result in substantial liability, higher costs and increased regulatory requirements. See &#8220;Employees&#8221; in Item 1. 
Operations Risks: 
The Failure of, or Damage to, the Companies&#8217; Facilities Could Adversely Affect the Companies. The Utilities provide electricity, gas and steam service using energy facilities, many of which are located either in, or close to, densely populated public places. See the description of the Utilities&#8217; facilities in Item 1. A failure of, or damage to, these facilities, or an error in the operation or maintenance of these facilities, could result in bodily injury or death, property damage, the release of hazardous substances or extended service interruptions. A natural disaster such as a major storm, a heat wave or hurricane could damage facilities and the Utilities may experience more severe consequences from attempting to operate during and after such events. The Utilities&#8217; response to such events may be perceived to be below customer expectations. The Utilities could be required to pay substantial amounts that may not be covered by the Utilities&#8217; insurance policies to repair or replace their facilities, compensate others for injury or death or other damage and settle any proceedings initiated by state utility regulators or other regulatory agencies. The occurrence of such events could also adversely affect the cost and availability of insurance. See &#8220;Other Regulatory Matters&#8221; in Note B &#32;and &#8220;Manhattan Explosion and Fire&#8221; in Note H &#32;to the financial statements in Item 8. Changes to laws, regulations or judicial doctrines could further expand the Utilities&#8217; liability for service interruptions. See &#8220;Utility Regulation &#8211; State Utility Regulation&#8221; and ""Environmental Matters"" in Item 1. 
A Cyber Attack Could Adversely Affect the Companies. The Companies and other operators of critical energy infrastructure and energy market participants face a heightened risk of cyber attack. Cyber attacks may include hacking, viruses, malware, denial of service attacks, ransomware or other data security breaches. The U.S. Department of Energy's Quadrennial Energy Review, issued in January 2017, indicated that cyber threats to the electricity system are increasing in sophistication, magnitude and frequency. The Companies&#8217; businesses require the continued operation of information systems and network infrastructure. See Item 1 for a description of the businesses of the Utilities, the Clean Energy Businesses and Con Edison Transmission. Interconnectivity with customers, independent system operators, energy traders and other energy market participants, suppliers, contractors and others exposes the Companies&#8217; information systems and network infrastructure to an increased risk of cyber attack and increases the risk that a cyber attack on the Companies could affect others. In the event of a cyber attack that the Companies were unable to defend against or mitigate, the Companies could have their operations and the operations of their customers and others disrupted. The Companies could also have their financial and other information systems and network infrastructure impaired, property damaged and customer and employee information stolen; experience substantial loss of revenues, response costs and other financial loss; and be subject to increased regulation, litigation and damage to their reputation. The Companies have experienced cyber attacks, although none of the attacks had a material impact. 
Environmental Risks: 
The Companies Are Exposed to Risks From The Environmental Consequences Of Their Operations. The Companies are exposed to risks relating to climate change and related matters. See &#8220;Environmental Matters &#8211; Climate Change&#8221; in Item 1. CECONY may also be impacted by regulations requiring reductions in air emissions. See &#8220;Environmental Matters &#8211; Other Federal, State and Local Environmental Provisions &#8211; Air Quality&#8221; in Item 1. In addition, the Utilities are responsible for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, PCBs and coal tar, that have been used or produced in the course of the Utilities&#8217; operations and are present on properties or in facilities and equipment currently or previously owned by them. See &#8220;Environmental Matters&#8221; in Item 1 and Note G &#32;to the financial statements in Item 8. The Companies could be adversely affected if a causal relationship between electric and magnetic fields and adverse health effects were to be established. 
Financial and Market Risks: 
A Disruption In The Wholesale Energy Markets Or Failure By An Energy Supplier Could Adversely Affect The Companies. Almost all the electricity and gas the Utilities sell to their full-service customers is purchased through the wholesale energy markets or pursuant to contracts with energy suppliers. See the description of the Utilities&#8217; energy supply in Item 1. A disruption in the wholesale energy markets or a failure on the part of the Utilities&#8217; energy suppliers or operators of energy delivery systems that connect to the Utilities&#8217; energy facilities could adversely affect their ability to meet their customers&#8217; energy needs and adversely affect the Companies. In addition, see &#8220;Financial and Commodity Market Risks&#8221; in Item 7. 
The Companies Have Substantial Unfunded Pension And Other Postretirement Benefit Liabilities. The Utilities have substantial unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities. The Utilities expect to make substantial contributions to their pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Significant declines in the market values of the investments held to fund pension and other postretirement benefits could trigger substantial funding requirements under governmental regulations. See &#8220;Application of Critical Accounting Policies &#8211; Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits&#8221; and &#8220;Financial and Commodity Market Risks&#8221; in Item 7 and Notes E &#32;and F &#32;to the financial statements in Item 8. 
Con Edison&#8217;s Ability To Pay Dividends Or Interest Depends On Dividends From Its Subsidiaries. Con Edison&#8217;s ability to pay dividends on its common stock or interest on its external borrowings depends primarily on the dividends and other distributions it receives from its subsidiaries. The dividends that the Utilities may pay to Con Edison are limited by the NYSPSC to not more than 100 percent of their respective income available for dividends calculated on a two-year rolling average basis, with certain exceptions. See &#8220;Dividends&#8221; in Note C &#32;to the financial statements in Item 8. 
The Companies Require Access To Capital Markets To Satisfy Funding Requirements. The Utilities estimate that their construction expenditures will exceed $ 9,500 million &#32;over the next three years. The Utilities use internally-generated funds, equity contributions from Con Edison, if any, and external borrowings to fund the construction expenditures. The Clean Energy Businesses and Con Edison Transmission are investing in renewable generation and energy infrastructure projects that require funds in excess of those produced in the businesses. Con Edison expects to finance its capital requirements primarily through internally generated funds and the sale of its securities. Changes in financial market conditions or in the Companies&#8217; credit ratings could adversely affect their ability to raise new capital and the cost thereof. See &#8220;Capital Requirements and Resources&#8221; in Item 1. 
CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2017 
Changes To Tax Laws Could Adversely Affect the Companies. Changes to tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof could have a material adverse impact on the Companies. The reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate to 21 percent under the TCJA is expected to result in decreased cash flows from operating activities, and require increased cash flows from financing activities, for the Utilities as and when rates the Utilities charge their customers are adjusted to reflect the reduction. Depending on the extent of these changes in cash flows, the changes could adversely impact the Companies&#8217; credit ratings. See &#8220;Capital Requirements and Resources &#8211; Capital Resources&#8221; in Item 1, &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources &#8211; Cash Flows from Operating Activities&#8221; in Item 7, ""Other Regulatory Matters"" in Note B and Note L to the financial statements in Item 8. 
Other Risks: 
The Companies&#8217; Strategies May Not Be Effective To Address Changes In The External Business Environment. The failure to identify, plan and execute strategies to address changes in the external business environment could have a material adverse impact on the Companies. Con Edison seeks to provide shareholder value through continued dividend growth, supported by earnings growth in regulated utilities and contracted assets. Changes to public policy, laws or regulations (or interpretations thereof), customer behavior or technology could significantly impact the value of the Utilities&#8217; energy delivery facilities, the Clean Energy Businesses&#8217; renewable and energy infrastructure projects and Con Edison Transmission's investment in electric and gas transmission projects. Such changes could also affect the Companies&#8217; opportunities to make additional investments in such assets and the potential return on the investments. See &#8220;Utility Regulation &#8211; State Utility Regulation &#8211; New York Utility Industry &#8211; Reforming the Energy Vision,&#8221; and &#8220;Competition&#8221; in Item 1. 
The Companies Also Face Other Risks That Are Beyond Their Control. The Companies&#8217; results of operations can be affected by circumstances or events that are beyond their control. Weather directly influences the demand for electricity, gas and steam service, and can affect the price of energy commodities. Terrorist or other physical attacks or acts of war could damage Company facilities. Economic conditions can affect customers&#8217; demand and ability to pay for service, which could adversely affect the Companies.

Information in any item of this report as to which reference is made in this Item 1A is incorporated by reference herein. The use of such terms as &#8220;see&#8221; or &#8220;refer to&#8221; shall be deemed to incorporate at the place such term is used the information to which such reference is made. 
The Companies&#8217; businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, and that involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual operating results, cash flows and financial condition. 
The Companies have established an enterprise risk management program to identify, assess, manage and monitor its major business risks based on established criteria for the severity of an event, the likelihood of its occurrence, and the programs in place to control the event or reduce the impact. The Companies&#8217; major risks include: 
Regulatory/Compliance Risks: 
The Companies Are Extensively Regulated And Are Subject To Penalties. The Companies&#8217; operations require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental agencies. State utility regulators may seek to impose substantial penalties on the Utilities for violations of state utility laws, regulations or orders. In addition, the Utilities' rate plans usually include penalties for failing to meet certain operating and customer satisfaction standards. See Note B &#32;to the financial statements in Item 8.

Environmental agencies may seek penalties for failure to comply with laws, regulations or permits. The Companies may also be subject to penalties from other regulatory agencies. The Companies may be subject to new laws, regulations, or other requirements or the revision or reinterpretation of such requirements, which could adversely affect them. In April 2014, the NYSPSC instituted its REV proceeding to improve system efficiency and reliability, encourage renewable energy resources, support distributed energy resources and empower customer choice. See &#8220;Utility Regulation&#8221; and &#8220;Environmental Matters &#8211; Climate Change and Other Federal, State and Local Environmental Provisions&#8221; in Item 1 and &#8220;Application of Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; in Item 7. 
The Utilities&#8217; Rate Plans May Not Provide A Reasonable Return. The Utilities have rate plans approved by state utility regulators that limit the rates they can charge their customers. The rates are generally designed for, but do not guarantee, the recovery of the Utilities&#8217; cost of service (including a return on equity). See &#8220;Utility Regulation &#8211; State Utility Regulation, Rate Plans&#8221; in Item 1 and &#8220;Rate Plans&#8221; in Note B &#32;to the financial statements in Item 8. Rates usually may not be changed during the specified terms of the rate plans other than to recover energy costs and limited other exceptions. The Utilities&#8217; actual costs may exceed levels provided for such costs in the rate plans. State utility regulators can initiate proceedings to prohibit the Utilities from recovering from their customers the cost of service (including energy costs) that the regulators determine to have been imprudently incurred (see ""Other Regulatory Matters"" in Note B &#32;to the financial statements in Item 8). The Utilities have from time to time entered into settlement agreements to resolve various prudence proceedings. 
The Companies May Be Adversely Affected By Changes To The Utilities&#8217; Rate Plans. The Utilities&#8217; rate plans typically require action by regulators at their expiration dates, which may include approval of new plans with different provisions. The need to recover from customers increasing costs, taxes or state-mandated assessments or surcharges could adversely affect the Utilities&#8217; opportunity to obtain new rate plans that provide a reasonable rate of return and continue important provisions of current rate plans. The Utilities&#8217; current New York electric and gas rate plans include revenue decoupling mechanisms and their New York electric, gas and steam rate plans include provisions for the recovery of energy costs and reconciliation of the actual amount of pension and other postretirement, environmental and certain other costs to amounts reflected in rates. See &#8220;Rate Plans&#8221; in Note B &#32;to the financial statements in Item 8. 
The Intentional Misconduct of Employees or Contractors Could Adversely Affect the Companies. The violation of laws or regulations by employees or contractors for personal gain may result from contract and procurement fraud, extortion, bribe acceptance, fraudulent related-party transactions and serious breaches of corporate policy or standards of business conduct. Such intentional misconduct by employees or contractors could result in substantial liability, higher costs and increased regulatory requirements. See &#8220;Employees&#8221; in Item 1. 
Operations Risks: 
The Failure of, or Damage to, the Companies&#8217; Facilities Could Adversely Affect the Companies. The Utilities provide electricity, gas and steam service using energy facilities, many of which are located either in, or close to, densely populated public places. See the description of the Utilities&#8217; facilities in Item 1. A failure of, or damage to, these facilities, or an error in the operation or maintenance of these facilities, could result in bodily injury or death, property damage, the release of hazardous substances or extended service interruptions. A natural disaster such as a major storm, a heat wave or hurricane could damage facilities and the Utilities may experience more severe consequences from attempting to operate during and after such events. The Utilities&#8217; response to such events may be perceived to be below customer expectations. The Utilities could be required to pay substantial amounts that may not be covered by the Utilities&#8217; insurance policies to repair or replace their facilities, compensate others for injury or death or other damage, and settle any proceedings initiated by state utility regulators or other regulatory agencies. The occurrence of such events could also adversely affect the cost and availability of insurance. See &#8220;Other Regulatory Matters&#8221; in Note B &#32;and ""Manhattan Steam Main Rupture"" and &#8220;Manhattan Explosion and Fire&#8221; in Note H &#32;to the financial statements in Item 8. Changes to laws, regulations or judicial doctrines could further expand the Utilities&#8217; liability for service interruptions. See &#8220;Utility Regulation &#8211; State Utility Regulation&#8221; and ""Environmental Matters"" in Item 1. 
A Cyber Attack Could Adversely Affect the Companies. The Utilities and other operators of critical energy infrastructure face a heightened risk of cyber attack. The U.S. Department of Energy's Quadrennial Energy Review, issued in January 2017, indicated that cyber threats to the electricity system are increasing in sophistication, magnitude, and frequency. In the event of a cyber attack that the Companies were unable to defend against or mitigate, the Companies could have their operations disrupted, financial and other information systems impaired, property damaged and customer and employee information stolen; experience substantial loss of revenues, response costs and other financial loss; and be subject to increased regulation, litigation and damage to their reputation. The Companies have experienced cyber attacks, although none of the attacks had a material impact. 
Environmental Risks: 
The Companies Are Exposed to Risks From The Environmental Consequences Of Their Operations. The Companies are exposed to risks relating to climate change and related matters. See &#8220;Environmental Matters &#8211; Climate Change&#8221; in Item 1. CECONY may also be impacted by regulations requiring reductions in air emissions. See &#8220;Environmental Matters &#8211; Other Federal, State and Local Environmental Provisions, Air Quality&#8221; in Item 1. In addition, the Utilities are responsible for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, PCBs and coal tar, that have been used or produced in the course of the Utilities&#8217; operations and are present on properties or in facilities and equipment currently or previously owned by them. See &#8220;Environmental Matters&#8221; in Item 1 and Note G &#32;to the financial statements in Item 8. The Companies could be adversely affected if a causal relationship between electric and magnetic fields and adverse health effects were to be established. 
Financial and Market Risks: 
A Disruption In The Wholesale Energy Markets Or Failure By An Energy Supplier Could Adversely Affect The Companies. Almost all the electricity and gas the Utilities sell to their full-service customers is purchased through the wholesale energy markets or pursuant to contracts with energy suppliers. See the description of the Utilities&#8217; energy supply in Item 1. A disruption in the wholesale energy markets or a failure on the part of the Utilities&#8217; energy suppliers or operators of energy delivery systems that connect to the Utilities&#8217; energy facilities could adversely affect their ability to meet their customers&#8217; energy needs and adversely affect the Companies. In addition, see &#8220;Financial and Commodity Market Risks&#8221; in Item 7. 
The Companies Have Substantial Unfunded Pension And Other Postretirement Benefit Liabilities. The Utilities have substantial unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities. The Utilities expect to make substantial contributions to their pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Significant declines in the market values of the investments held to fund pension and other postretirement benefits could trigger substantial funding requirements under governmental regulations. See &#8220;Application of Critical Accounting Policies &#8211; Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits&#8221; and &#8220;Financial and Commodity Market Risks,&#8221; in Item 7 and Notes E &#32;and F &#32;to the financial statements in Item 8. 
Con Edison&#8217;s Ability To Pay Dividends Or Interest Depends On Dividends From Its Subsidiaries. Con Edison&#8217;s ability to pay dividends on its common stock or interest on its external borrowings depends primarily on the dividends and other distributions it receives from its subsidiaries. The dividends that the Utilities may pay to Con Edison are limited by the NYSPSC to not more than 100 percent of their respective income available for dividends calculated on a two-year rolling average basis, with certain exceptions. See &#8220;Dividends&#8221; in Note C &#32;to the financial statements in Item 8. 
The Companies Require Access To Capital Markets To Satisfy Funding Requirements. The Utilities estimate that their construction expenditures will exceed $9 billion &#32;over the next three years. The Utilities use internally-generated funds, equity contributions from Con Edison, if any, and external borrowings to fund the construction expenditures. The Clean Energy Businesses and Con Edison Transmission are investing in renewable generation and energy infrastructure projects that require funds in excess of those produced in the businesses. Con Edison expects to finance its capital requirements primarily through internally generated funds and the sale of its securities. Changes in financial market conditions or in the Companies&#8217; credit ratings could adversely affect their ability to raise new capital and the cost thereof. See &#8220;Capital Requirements and Resources&#8221; in Item 1. 
Changes To Tax Laws Could Adversely Affect the Companies. Changes to tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof could have a material adverse impact on the Companies. Changes to tax laws that would have the effect of reducing Con Edison&#8217;s taxable income could adversely affect the company&#8217;s ability to use its renewable energy tax credits. See Note L to the financial statements in Item 8. 
Other Risks: 
The Companies&#8217; Strategies May Not Be Effective To Address Changes In The External Business Environment. The failure to identify, plan and execute strategies to address changes in the external business environment could have a material adverse impact on the Companies. Con Edison seeks to provide shareholder value through continued dividend growth, supported by earnings growth in regulated utilities and contracted assets. Changes to public policy, laws or regulations (or interpretations thereof), customer behavior or technology could significantly impact the value of the Utilities&#8217; energy delivery facilities, the Clean Energy Businesses&#8217; renewable and energy infrastructure projects and Con Edison Transmission's investment in electric and gas transmission projects. Such changes could also affect the Companies&#8217; opportunities to make additional investments in such assets and the potential return on the investments. See &#8220;Utility Regulation &#8211; State Utility Regulation &#8211; New York Utility Industry &#8211; Reforming the Energy Vision,&#8221; and &#8220;Competition&#8221; in Item 1. 
The Companies Also Face Other Risks That Are Beyond Their Control. The Companies&#8217; results of operations can be affected by circumstances or events that are beyond their control. Weather directly influences the demand for electricity, gas and steam service, and can affect the price of energy commodities. Terrorist or other physical attacks or acts of war could damage Company facilities. Economic conditions can affect customers&#8217; demand and ability to pay for service, which could adversely affect the Companies.

Information in any item of this report as to which reference is made in this Item 1A is incorporated by reference herein. The use of such terms as &#8220;see&#8221; or &#8220;refer to&#8221; shall be deemed to incorporate at the place such term is used the information to which such reference is made. 
The Companies&#8217; businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, and that involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual operating results, cash flows and financial condition. 
The Companies have established an enterprise risk management program to identify, assess, manage and monitor its major business risks based on established criteria for the severity of an event, the likelihood of its occurrence, and the programs in place to control the event or reduce the impact. The Companies&#8217; major risks include: 
Regulatory/Compliance Risks: 
The Companies Are Extensively Regulated And Are Subject To Penalties. The Companies&#8217; operations require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental agencies. State utility regulators may seek to impose substantial penalties on the Utilities for violations of state utility laws, regulations or orders. In addition, the Utilities' rate plans usually include penalties for failing to meet certain operating and customer satisfaction standards. See Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. FERC has the authority to impose penalties on the Utilities and the competitive energy businesses, which could be substantial, for violations of the Federal Power Act, the Natural Gas Act or related rules, including reliability and cyber security rules. Environmental agencies may seek penalties for failure to comply with laws, regulations or permits. The Companies may also be subject to penalties from other regulatory agencies. The Companies may be subject to new laws, regulations, or other requirements or the revision or reinterpretation of such requirements, which could adversely affect the Companies. In April 2014, the NYSPSC instituted its REV proceeding to improve system efficiency and reliability, encourage renewable energy resources, support distributed energy resources and empower customer choice. See &#8220;Utility Regulation&#8221; and &#8220;Environmental Matters &#8211; Climate Change and Other Federal, State and Local Environmental Provisions&#8221; in Item 1 and &#8220;Application of Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; in Item 7. 
The Utilities&#8217; Rate Plans May Not Provide A Reasonable Return. The Utilities have rate plans approved by state utility regulators that limit the rates they can charge their customers. The rates are generally designed for, but do not guarantee, the recovery of the Utilities&#8217; cost of service (including a return on equity). See &#8220;Utility Regulation &#8211; State Utility Regulation, Rate Plans&#8221; in Item 1 and &#8220;Rate Plans&#8221; in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. Rates usually may not be changed during the specified terms of the rate plans other than to recover energy costs and limited other exceptions. The Utilities&#8217; actual costs may exceed levels provided for such costs in the rate plans. State utility regulators can initiate proceedings to prohibit the Utilities from recovering from their customers the cost of service (including energy costs) that the regulators determine to have been imprudently incurred (see &#8220;Other Regulatory Matters&#8221; in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8). The Utilities have from time to time entered into settlement agreements to resolve various prudence proceedings. 
The Companies May Be Adversely Affected By Changes To The Utilities&#8217; Rate Plans. The Utilities&#8217; rate plans typically require action by regulators at their expiration dates, which may include approval of new plans with different provisions. The need to recover from customers increasing costs, taxes or state-mandated assessments or surcharges could adversely affect the Utilities&#8217; opportunity to obtain new rate plans that provide a reasonable rate of return and continue important provisions of current rate plans. The Utilities&#8217; current New York electric and gas rate plans include revenue decoupling mechanisms and their New York electric, gas and steam rate plans include provisions for the recovery of energy costs and reconciliation of the actual amount of pension and other postretirement, environmental and certain other costs to amounts reflected in rates. In January 2016, CECONY submitted requests to the NYSPSC for new rate plans for electric and gas delivery service to take effect in January 2017. See &#8220;Rate Plans&#8221; in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. 
The Intentional Misconduct of Employees or Contractors Could Adversely Affect the Companies. The violation of laws or regulations by employees or contractors for personal gain may result from contract and procurement fraud, extortion, bribe acceptance, fraudulent related-party transactions and serious breaches of corporate policy or standards of business conduct. Such intentional misconduct by employees or contractors could result in substantial liability, higher costs and increased regulatory requirements. See &#8220;Employees&#8221; in Item 1 and &#8220;Other Regulatory Matters&#8221; in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. 
Operations Risks: 
The Failure of, or Damage to, the Companies&#8217; Facilities Could Adversely Affect the Companies. The Utilities provide electricity, gas and steam service using energy facilities, many of which are located either in, or close to, densely populated public places. See the description of the Utilities&#8217; facilities in Item 1. A failure of, or damage to, these facilities, or an error in the operation or maintenance of these facilities, could result in bodily injury or death, property damage, the release of hazardous substances or extended service interruptions. A natural disaster such as a major storm, a heat wave or hurricane could damage facilities and the Utilities may experience more severe consequences from attempting to operate during and after such events. The Utilities&#8217; response to such events may be perceived to be below customer expectations. The Utilities could be required to pay substantial amounts that may not be covered by the Utilities&#8217; insurance policies to repair or replace their facilities, compensate others for injury or death or other damage, and settle any proceedings initiated by state utility regulators or other regulatory agencies. The occurrence of such events could also adversely affect the cost and availability of insurance. See &#8220;Other Regulatory Matters&#8221; in Note B and &#8220;Manhattan Steam Main Rupture&#8221; and &#8220;Manhattan Explosion and Fire&#8221; in Note H to the financial statements in Item 8. Changes to laws, regulations or judicial doctrines could further expand the Utilities&#8217; liability for service interruptions. See &#8220;Utility Regulation &#8211; State Utility Regulation&#8221; in Item 1. 
A Cyber Attack Could Adversely Affect the Companies. The Utilities and other operators of critical energy infrastructure may face a heightened risk of cyber attack. In the event of a cyber attack that the Companies were unable to defend against or mitigate, the Companies could have their operations disrupted, financial and other information systems impaired, property damaged and customer and employee information stolen; experience substantial loss of revenues, response costs and other financial loss; and be subject to increased regulation, litigation and damage to their reputation. The Companies have experienced cyber attacks, although none of the attacks had a material impact. 
Environmental Risks: 
The Companies Are Exposed to Risks From The Environmental Consequences Of Their Operations. The Companies are exposed to risks relating to climate change and related matters. See &#8220;Environmental Matters &#8211; Climate Change&#8221; in Item 1. CECONY may also be impacted by regulations requiring reductions in air emissions. See &#8220;Environmental Matters &#8211; Other Federal, State and Local Environmental Provisions, Air Quality&#8221; in Item 1. In addition, the Utilities are responsible for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, PCBs and coal tar, that have been used or produced in the course of the Utilities&#8217; operations and are present on properties or in facilities and equipment currently or previously owned by them. See &#8220;Environmental Matters&#8221; in Item 1 and Note G to the financial statements in Item 8. The Companies could be adversely affected if a causal relationship between electric and magnetic fields and adverse health effects were to be established. 
Financial and Market Risks: 
A Disruption In The Wholesale Energy Markets Or Failure By An Energy Supplier Could Adversely Affect The Companies. Almost all the electricity and gas the Utilities sell to their full-service customers is purchased through the wholesale energy markets or pursuant to contracts with energy suppliers. See the description of the Utilities&#8217; energy supply in Item 1. Con Edison&#8217;s competitive energy businesses also depend on wholesale energy markets to supply electricity to their customers. See &#8220;Competitive Energy Businesses&#8221; in Item 1. A disruption in the wholesale energy markets or a failure on the part of the Companies&#8217; energy suppliers or operators of energy delivery systems that connect to the Utilities&#8217; energy facilities could adversely affect the Companies&#8217; ability to meet their customers&#8217; energy needs and adversely affect the Companies. In addition, see &#8220;Financial and Commodity Market Risks&#8221; in Item 7. 
The Companies Have Substantial Unfunded Pension And Other Postretirement Benefit Liabilities. The Utilities have substantial unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities. The Utilities expect to make substantial contributions to their pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Significant declines in the market values of the investments held to fund pension and other postretirement benefits could trigger substantial funding requirements under governmental regulations. See &#8220;Application of Critical Accounting Policies &#8211; Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits&#8221; and &#8220;Financial and Commodity Market Risks,&#8221; in Item 7 and Notes E and F to the financial statements in Item 8. 
Con Edison&#8217;s Ability To Pay Dividends Or Interest Depends On Dividends From Its Subsidiaries. Con Edison&#8217;s ability to pay dividends on its common stock or interest on its external borrowings depends primarily on the dividends and other distributions it receives from its subsidiaries. The dividends that the Utilities may pay to Con Edison are limited by the NYSPSC to not more than 100 percent of their respective income available for dividends calculated on a two-year rolling average basis, with certain exceptions. See &#8220;Dividends&#8221; in Note C to the financial statements in Item 8. 
The Companies Require Access To Capital Markets To Satisfy Funding Requirements. The Utilities estimate that their construction expenditures will exceed $9 billion &#32;over the next three years. The Utilities use internally-generated funds, equity contributions from Con Edison, if any, and external borrowings to fund the construction expenditures. The competitive energy businesses are investing in renewable generation and energy infrastructure projects that require funds in excess of those produced in the businesses. Con Edison expects to finance its capital requirements primarily through internally generated funds and the sale of its securities. Changes in financial market conditions or in the Companies&#8217; credit ratings could adversely affect their ability to raise new capital and the cost thereof. See &#8220;Capital Requirements and Resources&#8221; in Item 1. 
Other Risks: 
The Companies&#8217; Strategies May Not Be Effective To Address Changes In The External Business Environment. The failure to identify, plan and execute strategies to address changes in the external business environment could have a material adverse impact on the Companies. Con Edison seeks to provide shareholder value through continued dividend growth, supported by earnings growth in regulated utilities and contracted assets. Changes to public policy, regulation, tax policy, customer behavior or technology could significantly impact the value of the Utilities&#8217; energy delivery facilities, the competitive energy businesses&#8217; renewable and energy infrastructure projects and Con Edison Transmission's investment in electric and gas transmission projects. Such changes could 
also affect the Companies&#8217; opportunities to make additional investments in such assets and the potential return on the investments. See &#8220;Utility Regulation &#8211; State Utility Regulation &#8211; New York Utility Industry &#8211; Reforming the Energy Vision,&#8221; and &#8220;Competition&#8221; in Item 1. 
The Companies Also Face Other Risks That Are Beyond Their Control. The Companies&#8217; results of operations can be affected by circumstances or events that are beyond their control. Weather directly influences the demand for electricity, gas and steam service, and can affect the price of energy commodities. Terrorist or other physical attacks or acts of war could damage Company facilities. Economic conditions can affect customers&#8217; demand and ability to pay for service, which could adversely affect the Companies.

In February 2014, the NYSPSC adopted a Joint Proposal with respect to CECONY&#146;s rates for electric, gas and steam delivery service in 2014 and 2015 (and, for gas and steam delivery service, 2016). See &#147;Rate Plans&#148; in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. 
The Intentional Misconduct of Employees or Contractors Could Adversely Affect the Companies.

The Companies&#146; businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, and that involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual operating results, cash flows and financial condition. 
The Companies have established an enterprise risk management program to identify, assess, manage and monitor its major business risks based on established criteria for the severity of an event, the likelihood of its occurrence, and the programs in place to control the event or reduce the impact. The Companies also have financial and commodity market risks. See &#147;Financial and Commodity Market Risks&#148; in Item 7. 
The Companies&#146; major risks include: 
The Failure to Operate Energy Facilities Safely and Reliably Could Adversely Affect The Companies. The Utilities provide electricity, gas and steam service using energy facilities, many of which are located either in, or close to, densely populated public places. See the description of the Utilities&#146; facilities in Item 1. A failure of, or damage to, these facilities, or an error in the operation or maintenance of these facilities, could result in bodily injury or death, property damage, the release of hazardous substances or extended service interruptions. In such event, the Utilities could be required to pay substantial amounts, which may not be covered by the Utilities&#146; insurance policies, to repair or replace their facilities, compensate others for injury or death or other damage, and settle any proceedings initiated by state utility regulators or other regulatory agencies. In late October 2012, Superstorm Sandy caused extensive damage to the Utilities&#146; electric distribution system and interrupted service to approximately 1.4 million of the Utilities&#146; customers. See &#147;Other Regulatory Matters&#148; in Note B and &#147;Manhattan Steam Main Rupture&#148; in Note H to the financial statements in Item 8. The occurrence of such an event could also adversely affect the cost and availability of insurance. Changes to laws, regulations or judicial doctrines could further expand the Utilities&#146; liability for service interruptions. See &#147;Utility Regulation &#150; State Utility Regulation&#148; in Item 1. 
The Failure To Properly Complete Construction Projects Could Adversely Affect The Companies. The Utilities&#146; ongoing construction program includes large energy transmission, substation and distribution system projects. The failure to properly complete these projects timely and effectively could adversely affect the Utilities&#146; ability to meet their customers&#146; growing energy needs with the high level of safety and reliability 
that they currently provide, which would adversely affect the Companies. See &#147;Capital Requirements&#148;, &#147;New York Energy Highway&#148; and &#147;CECONY &#150; Electric Operations &#150; Electric Supply&#148; in Item 1. 
The Companies Are Extensively Regulated And Are Subject To Penalties. The Companies&#146; operations require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental agencies. State utility regulators may seek to impose substantial penalties on the Utilities for violations of state utility laws, regulations or orders. In addition, the Utilities rate plans usually include penalties for failing to meet certain operating standards. See Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. FERC has the authority to impose penalties on the Utilities and the competitive energy businesses, which could be substantial, for violations of the Federal Power Act, the Natural Gas Act or related rules, including reliability and cyber security rules. Environmental agencies may seek penalties for failure to comply with laws, regulations or permits. The Companies may also be subject to penalties from other regulatory agencies. The Companies may be subject to new laws, regulations, accounting standards or other requirements or the revision or reinterpretation of such requirements, which could adversely affect the Companies. In December 2013, the NYSPSC directed its staff to recommend, for commencement in the first quarter of 2014, a process that will result in timely decisions regarding the broad restructuring of distribution utility regulation. See &#147;Utility Regulation&#148; and &#147;Environmental Matters &#150; Climate Change and Other Federal, State and Local Environmental Provisions&#148; in Item 1 and &#147;Application of Critical Accounting Policies&#148; in Item 7. 
The Utilities&#146; Rate Plans May Not Provide A Reasonable Return. The Utilities have rate plans approved by state utility regulators that limit the rates they can charge their customers. The rates are generally designed for, but do not guarantee, the recovery of the Utilities&#146; cost of service (including a return on equity). The Utilities&#146; rate plans can involve complex accounting and other calculations, a mistake in which could have a substantial adverse affect on the Utilities. See &#147;Utility Regulation &#150; State Utility Regulation, Rate Plans&#148; in Item 1 and &#147;Rate Plans&#148; in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. Rates usually may not be changed during the specified terms of the rate plans other than to recover energy costs and limited other exceptions. The Utilities&#146; actual costs may exceed levels provided for such costs in the rate plans. The Utilities&#146; rate plans usually include penalties for failing to meet certain operating standards. State utility regulators can initiate proceedings to prohibit the Utilities from recovering from their customers the cost of service (including energy costs) that the regulators determine to have been imprudently incurred (see &#147;Other Regulatory Matters&#148; in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8). The Utilities have from time to time entered into settlement agreements to resolve various prudence proceedings. 
The Companies May Be Adversely Affected By Changes To The Utilities&#146; Rate Plans. The Utilities&#146; rate plans typically require action by regulators at their expiration dates, which may include approval of new plans with different provisions. The need to recover from customers increasing costs, taxes or state-mandated assessments or surcharges could adversely affect the Utilities&#146; opportunity to obtain new rate plans that provide a reasonable rate of return and continue important provisions of current rate plans. The Utilities&#146; current New York electric and gas rate plans include revenue decoupling mechanisms and their New York electric, gas and steam rate plans include provisions for the recovery of energy costs and reconciliation of the actual amount of pension and other postretirement, environmental and certain other costs to amounts reflected in rates. In February 2014, the NYSPSC adopted a Joint Proposal with respect to CECONY&#146;s rates for electric, gas and steam delivery service in 2014 and 2015 (and, for gas and steam delivery service, 2016). See &#147;Rate Plans&#148; in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. 
The Companies Are Exposed to Risks From The Environmental Consequences Of Their Operations. The Companies are exposed to risks relating to climate change and related matters. See &#147;Environmental Matters &#150; Climate Change&#148; in Item 1. CECONY may also be impacted by regulations requiring reductions in air emissions. See &#147;Environmental Matters &#150; Other Federal, State and Local Environmental Provisions, Air Quality&#148; in Item 1. In addition, the Utilities are responsible for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, PCBs and coal tar, that have been used or produced in the course of the Utilities&#146; operations and are present on properties or in facilities and equipment currently or previously owned by them. See &#147;Environmental Matters&#148; in Item 1 and Note G to the financial statements in Item 8. Electric and magnetic fields are found wherever electricity is used. The Companies could be adversely affected if a causal relationship between these fields and adverse health effects were to be established. Negative perceptions about electric and magnetic fields can make it more difficult to construct facilities needed for the Companies&#146; operations. 
The Companies Have Substantial Unfunded Pension And Other Postretirement Benefit Liabilities. The Utilities have substantial unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities. The Utilities expect to make substantial contributions to their pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Significant declines in the market values of the investments held to fund pension and other postretirement benefits could trigger substantial funding requirements under governmental regulations. See &#147;Application of Critical Accounting Policies &#150; Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits&#148; and &#147;Financial and Commodity Market Risks,&#148; in Item 7 and Notes E and F to the financial statements in Item 8. 
Con Edison&#146;s Ability To Pay Dividends Or Interest Depends On Dividends From Its Subsidiaries. Con Edison&#146;s ability to pay dividends on its common stock or interest on its external borrowings depends primarily on the dividends and other distributions it receives from its subsidiaries. The dividends that the Utilities may pay to Con Edison are limited by the NYSPSC to not more than 100 percent of their respective income available for dividends calculated on a two-year rolling average basis, with certain exceptions. See &#147;Dividends&#148; in Note C to the financial statements in Item 8. 
The Companies Require Access To Capital Markets To Satisfy Funding Requirements. The Utilities estimate that their construction expenditures will exceed $7 billion over the next three years. The Utilities use internally-generated funds, equity contributions from Con Edison, if any, and external borrowings to fund the construction expenditures. The competitive energy businesses are evaluating opportunities to invest in renewable generation and energy-related infrastructure projects that would require funds in excess of those produced in the businesses. Con Edison expects to finance its capital requirements primarily through internally generated funds and the sale of its securities. The company does not expect to need to issue common equity in 2014. Changes in financial market conditions or in the Companies&#146; credit ratings could adversely affect their ability to raise new capital and the cost thereof. See &#147;Capital Requirements and Resources&#148; in Item 1. 
A Cyber Attack Could Adversely Affect the Companies. The Utilities and other operators of critical energy infrastructure may face a heightened risk of cyber attack. The Companies have experienced cyber attacks, although none of the attacks had a material impact on the Companies. In the event of a cyber attack that the Companies were unable to defend against or mitigate, the Utilities and the competitive energy businesses could have their operations disrupted, financial and other information systems impaired, property damaged and customer information stolen; experience substantial loss of revenues, response costs and other financial loss; and be subject to increased regulation, litigation and damage to their reputation. 
The Companies Also Face Other Risks That Are Beyond Their Control. The Companies&#146; results of operations can be affected by circumstances or events that are beyond their control. Weather directly influences the demand for electricity, gas and steam service, and can affect the price of energy commodities. Natural disasters, such as a major storm, heat wave or hurricane (see &#147;Environmental Matters &#150; Climate Change&#148; in Item 1 and &#147;Other Regulatory Matters&#148; in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8) or terrorist or other physical attacks or acts of war could damage Company facilities. As a provider of essential utility services, the Utilities may experience more severe consequences from attempting to operate during and after such events. In addition, pandemic illness could potentially disrupt the Utilities&#146; employees and contractors from providing essential utility services. Economic conditions can affect customers&#146; demand and ability to pay for service, which could adversely affect the Companies.

The use of such terms as &#147;see&#148; or &#147;refer to&#148; shall be deemed to incorporate at the place such term is used the information to which such reference is made. 
The Companies&#146; businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, and that involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual operating results, cash flows and financial condition. 
The Companies have established an enterprise risk management program to identify, assess, manage and monitor its major operations and administrative risks based on established criteria for the severity of an event, the likelihood of its occurrence, and the programs in place to control the event or reduce the impact. The Companies also have financial and commodity market risks. See &#147;Financial and Commodity Market Risks&#148; in Item 7. 
The Companies&#146; major risks include: 
The Failure to Operate Energy Facilities Safely and Reliably Could Adversely Affect The Companies. The Utilities provide electricity, gas and steam service using energy facilities, many of which are located either in, or close to, densely populated public places. See the description of the Utilities&#146; facilities in Item 1. A failure of, or damage to, these facilities, or an error in the operation or maintenance of these facilities, could result in bodily injury or death, property damage, the release of hazardous substances or extended service interruptions. In such event, the Utilities could be required to pay substantial amounts, which may not be covered by the Utilities&#146; insurance policies, to repair or replace their facilities, compensate others for injury or death or other damage, and settle any proceedings initiated by state utility regulators or other regulatory agencies. In late October 2012, Superstorm Sandy caused extensive damage to the Utilities&#146; electric distribution system and interrupted service to approximately 1.4 million of the Utilities&#146; customers. See &#147;Other Regulatory Matters&#148; in Note B and &#147;Manhattan Steam Main Rupture&#148; in Note H to the financial statements in Item 8. The occurrence of such an event could also adversely affect the cost and availability of insurance. Changes to laws, regulations or judicial doctrines could further expand the Utilities&#146; liability for service interruptions. See &#147;Utility Regulation &#150; State Utility Regulation&#148; in Item 1. 
The Failure To Properly Complete Construction Projects Could Adversely Affect The Companies. The Utilities&#146; ongoing construction program includes large energy transmission, substation and distribution system projects. The failure to properly complete these projects timely and effectively could adversely affect the Utilities&#146; ability to meet their customers&#146; growing energy needs with the high level of safety and reliability that they currently provide, which would adversely affect the Companies. See &#147;Capital Requirements&#148; and &#147;New York Energy Highway&#148; in Item 1. 
The Failure of Processes and Systems and the Performance of Employees and Contractors Could Adversely Affect the Companies. The Companies have developed business processes for operations, customer service, legal compliance, personnel, accounting, planning and other matters. Some of the Companies&#146; information systems and communications systems have been operating for many years, and may become obsolete. In 2012, the Utilities implemented new financial and supply-chain enterprise resource planning information systems. See Item 9A. The failure of the Companies&#146; business processes or information or communication systems could adversely affect the Companies&#146; operations and liquidity and result in substantial liability, higher costs and increased regulatory requirements. The failure by the Companies&#146; employees or contractors to follow procedures, or their unsafe actions, errors or intentional misconduct, or work stoppages could also adversely affect the Companies. See &#147;Employees&#148; in Item 1 and &#147;Other Regulatory Matters&#148; in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. 
The Utilities&#146; Rate Plans May Not Provide A Reasonable Return. The Utilities have rate plans approved by state utility regulators that limit the rates they can charge their customers. The rates are generally designed for, but do not guarantee, the recovery of the Utilities&#146; cost of service (including a return on equity). The Utilities&#146; rate plans can involve complex accounting and other calculations, a mistake in which could have a substantial adverse affect on the Utilities. See &#147;Utility Regulation &#150; State Utility Regulation, Rate Plans&#148; in Item 1 and &#147;Rate Agreements&#148; in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. Rates usually may not be changed during the specified terms of the rate plans other than to recover energy costs and limited other exceptions. The Utilities&#146; actual costs may exceed levels provided for such costs in the rate plans. The Utilities&#146; rate plans usually include penalties for failing to meet certain operating standards. State utility regulators can initiate proceedings to prohibit the Utilities from recovering from their customers the cost of service (including energy costs) that the regulators determine to have been imprudently incurred (see &#147;Other Regulatory Matters&#148; in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8). The Utilities have from time to time entered into settlement agreements to resolve various prudence proceedings. 
The Companies May Be Adversely Affected By Changes To The Utilities&#146; Rate Plans. The Utilities&#146; rate plans typically require action by regulators at their expiration dates, which may include approval of new plans with different provisions. The need to recover from customers increasing costs, taxes or state-mandated assessments or surcharges could adversely affect the Utilities&#146; opportunity to obtain new rate plans that provide a reasonable rate of return and continue important provisions of current rate plans. The Utilities&#146; current New York electric and gas rate plans include revenue decoupling mechanisms and their New York electric, gas and steam rate plans include provisions for the recovery of energy costs and reconciliation of the actual amount of pension and other postretirement, environmental and certain other costs to amounts reflected in rates. In January 2013, CECONY filed a request with the NYSPSC for new electric, gas and steam rate plans. See &#147;Rate Agreements&#148; in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. 
The Companies Are Exposed to Risks From The Environmental Consequences Of Their Operations. The Companies are exposed to risks relating to climate change and related matters. See &#147;Environmental Matters &#150; Climate Change&#148; in Item 1. CECONY may also be impacted by regulations requiring reductions in air emissions. See &#147;Environmental Matters &#150; Other Federal, State and Local Environmental Provisions, Air Quality&#148; in Item 1. In addition, the Utilities are responsible for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, PCBs and coal tar, that have been used or produced in the course of the Utilities&#146; operations and are present on properties or in facilities and equipment currently or previously owned by them. See &#147;Environmental Matters&#148; in Item 1 and Note G to the financial statements in Item 8. Electric and magnetic fields are found wherever electricity is used. The Companies could be adversely affected if a causal relationship between these fields and adverse health effects were to be established. Negative perceptions about electric and magnetic fields can make it more difficult to construct facilities needed for the Companies&#146; operations. 
A Disruption In The Wholesale Energy Markets Or Failure By An Energy Supplier Could Adversely Affect The Companies. &#160; Almost all the electricity and gas the Utilities sell to their full-service customers is purchased through the wholesale energy markets or pursuant to contracts with energy suppliers. See the description of the Utilities&#146; energy supply in Item 1. Con Edison Energy and Con Edison Solutions also depend on wholesale energy markets to supply electricity to their customers. See &#147;Competitive Energy Businesses&#148; in Item 1. A disruption in the wholesale energy markets or a failure on the part of the Companies&#146; energy suppliers or operators of energy delivery systems that connect to the Utilities&#146; energy facilities could adversely affect the Companies&#146; ability to meet their customers&#146; energy needs and adversely affect the Companies. 
The Companies Have Substantial Unfunded Pension And Other Postretirement Benefit Liabilities. The Utilities have substantial unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities. The Utilities expect to make substantial contributions to their pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Significant declines in the market values of the investments held to fund pension and other postretirement benefits could trigger substantial funding requirements under governmental regulations. See &#147;Application of Critical Accounting Policies &#150; 
Con Edison&#146;s Ability To Pay Dividends Or Interest Depends On Dividends From Its Subsidiaries. Con Edison&#146;s ability to pay dividends on its common stock or interest on its external borrowings depends primarily on the dividends and other distributions it receives from its subsidiaries. The dividends that the Utilities may pay to Con Edison are limited by the NYSPSC to not more than 100 percent of their respective income available for dividends calculated on a two-year rolling average basis, with certain exceptions. See &#147;Dividends&#148; in Note C to the financial statements in Item 8. 
The Companies Require Access To Capital Markets To Satisfy Funding Requirements. The Utilities estimate that their construction expenditures will exceed $6 billion over the next three years. The Utilities may use internally-generated funds, equity contributions from Con Edison and external borrowings to fund the construction expenditures. The competitive energy businesses are evaluating opportunities to invest in renewable generation and energy-related infrastructure projects that would require funds in excess of those produced in the businesses. Con Edison expects to finance its capital requirements primarily through internally generated funds and the sale of its securities. In addition, Con Edison Development is evaluating long-term debt financing for the solar projects it acquired in 2012. See &#147;Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities&#148; in Item 7. The company does not expect to need to issue additional common equity in 2013. Changes in financial market conditions or in the Companies&#146; credit ratings could adversely affect their ability to raise new capital and the cost thereof. See &#147;Capital Requirements and Resources&#148; in Item 1. 
The Internal Revenue Service Has Disallowed Substantial Tax Deductions Taken By The Company. The Companies&#146; federal income tax returns reflect certain tax positions with which the Internal Revenue Service does not or may not agree, including the deduction of the cost of certain repairs to utility plant for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility (see Note L to the financial statements in Item 8). In January 2013, a federal appeals court reversed a trial court decision that had allowed deductions claimed by Con Edison relating to Con Edison Development&#146;s 1997 lease in/lease out (&#147;LILO&#148;) transaction. As a result, with respect to the 1997 and 1999 LILO transactions, Con Edison expects to record an estimated charge of between $150 million and $170 million (after-tax) in the first quarter of 2013 and has made deposits of $447 million with federal and state tax agencies. See Note J to the financial statements in Item 8. 
A Cyber Attack Could Adversely Affect the Companies. The Utilities and other operators of critical energy infrastructure may face a heightened risk of cyber attack. The Companies have experienced cyber attacks, although none of the attacks had a material impact on the Companies. In the event of a cyber attack that the Companies were unable to defend against or mitigate, the Utilities and the competitive energy businesses could have their operations disrupted, financial and other information systems impaired, property damaged and customer information stolen; experience substantial loss of revenues, response costs and other financial loss; and be subject to increased regulation, litigation and damage to their reputation. 
The Companies Also Face Other Risks That Are Beyond Their Control. &#160; The Companies&#146; results of operations can be affected by circumstances or events that are beyond their control. Weather directly influences the demand for electricity, gas and steam service, and can affect the price of energy commodities. Natural disasters, such as a major storm, heat wave or hurricane (see &#147;Environmental Matters &#150; Climate Change&#148; in Item 1 and &#147;Other Regulatory Matters&#148; in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8) or terrorist attacks or related acts of war could damage Company facilities. As a provider of essential utility services, the Utilities may experience more severe consequences from attempting to operate during and after such events. In addition, pandemic illness could potentially disrupt the Utilities&#146; employees and contractors from providing essential utility services. Economic conditions can affect customers&#146; demand and ability to pay for service, which could adversely affect the Companies.

The failure of the Companies&#146; business processes or information or communication systems could adversely affect the Companies&#146; operations and 
The Companies Are Extensively Regulated And Are Subject To Penalties. The Companies&#146; operations require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental agencies. State utility regulators may seek to impose substantial penalties on the Utilities for violations of state utility laws, regulations or orders. In addition, the Utilities rate plans usually include penalties for failing to meet certain operating standards. FERC has the authority to impose penalties on the Utilities and the competitive energy businesses, which could be substantial, for violations of the Federal Power Act, the Natural Gas Act or related rules, including reliability rules. Environmental agencies may seek penalties for failure to comply with laws, regulations or permits. The Companies may also be subject to penalties from other regulatory agencies. The Companies may be subject to new laws, regulations, accounting standards or other requirements or the revision or reinterpretation of such requirements, which could adversely affect the Companies. See &#147;Utility Regulation&#148; and &#147;Environmental Matters &#150; Climate Change and Other Federal, State and Local Environmental Provisions&#148; in Item 1 and &#147;Application of Critical Accounting Policies&#148; in Item 7.

FERC has the authority to impose penalties on the Utilities and the competitive energy businesses, which could be substantial, for violations of the Federal Power Act, the Natural Gas Act or related rules, including reliability rules. Environmental agencies may seek penalties for failure to comply with laws, regulations or permits. See &#147;Permit Non-Compliance and Pollution Discharges&#148; in Item 3. The Companies may also be subject to penalties from other regulatory agencies. The Companies may be subject to new laws, regulations, accounting standards or other requirements or the revision or reinterpretation of such requirements, which could adversely affect the Companies. See &#147;Utility Regulation&#148; and &#147;Environmental Matters &#150; Climate Change and Other Federal, State and Local Environmental Provisions&#148; in Item 1 and &#147;Application of Critical Accounting Policies&#148; in Item 7. 
The Utilities&#146; Rate Plans May Not Provide A Reasonable Return. The Utilities have rate plans approved by state utility regulators that limit the rates they can charge their customers. The rates are generally designed for, but do not guarantee, the recovery of the Utilities&#146; cost of service (including a return on equity). The Utilities&#146; rate plans can involve complex accounting and other calculations, a mistake in which could have a substantial adverse affect on the Utilities. See &#147;Utility Regulation &#150; State Utility Regulation, Rate Plans&#148; in Item 1 and &#147;Rate Agreements&#148; in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. Rates usually may not be changed during the specified terms of the rate plans other than to recover energy costs and limited other exceptions. The Utilities&#146; actual costs may exceed levels provided for such costs in the rate plans. The Utilities&#146; rate plans usually include penalties for failing to meet certain operating standards. State utility regulators can initiate proceedings to prohibit the Utilities from recovering from their customers the cost of service (including energy costs) that the regulators determine to have been imprudently incurred (see &#147;Other Regulatory Matters&#148; in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8). The Utilities have from time to time entered into settlement agreements to resolve various prudence proceedings. 
The Companies May Be Adversely Affected By Changes To The Utilities&#146; Rate Plans. The Utilities&#146; rate plans typically require action by regulators at their expiration dates, which may include approval of new plans with different provisions. The need to recover from customers increasing costs, taxes or state-mandated assessments or surcharges could adversely affect the Utilities&#146; opportunity to obtain new rate plans that provide a reasonable rate of return and continue important provisions of current rate plans. The Utilities&#146; current New York electric and gas rate plans include revenue decoupling mechanisms and their New York electric, gas and steam rate plans include provisions for the recovery of energy costs and reconciliation of the actual amount of pension and other postretirement, environmental and certain other costs to amounts reflected in rates. See &#147;Rate Agreements&#148; in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. 
The Companies Are Exposed to Risks From The Environmental Consequences Of Their Operations. The Companies are exposed to risks relating to climate change and related matters. See &#147;Environmental Matters &#150; Climate Change&#148; in Item 1. CECONY may also be impacted by regulations requiring reductions in air emissions. See &#147;Environmental Matters &#150; Other Federal, State and Local Environmental Provisions, Air Quality&#148; in Item 1. In addition, the Utilities are responsible for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, PCBs and coal tar, that have been used or produced in the course of the Utilities&#146; operations and are present on properties or in facilities and equipment currently or previously owned by them. See &#147;Environmental Matters&#148; in 
A Disruption In The Wholesale Energy Markets Or Failure By An Energy Supplier Could Adversely Affect The Companies. Almost all the electricity and gas the Utilities sell to their full-service customers is purchased through the wholesale energy markets or pursuant to contracts with energy suppliers. See the description of the Utilities&#146; energy supply in Item 1. Con Edison Energy and Con Edison Solutions also depend on wholesale energy markets to supply electricity to their customers. See &#147;Competitive Energy Businesses&#148; in Item 1. A disruption in the wholesale energy markets or a failure on the part of the Companies&#146; energy suppliers or operators of energy delivery systems that connect to the Utilities&#146; energy facilities could adversely affect the Companies&#146; ability to meet their customers&#146; energy needs and adversely affect the Companies. 
The Companies Have Substantial Unfunded Pension And Other Postretirement Benefit Liabilities. The Utilities have substantial unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities. The Utilities expect to make substantial contributions to their pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Significant declines in the market values of the investments held to fund the pension and other postretirement benefits could trigger substantial funding requirements under governmental regulations. See &#147;Application of Critical Accounting Policies &#150; Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits&#148; and &#147;Financial and Commodity Market Risks,&#148; in Item 7 and Notes E and F to the financial statements in Item 8. 
Con Edison&#146;s Ability To Pay Dividends Or Interest Depends On Dividends From Its Subsidiaries. Con Edison&#146;s ability to pay dividends on its common stock or interest on its external borrowings depends primarily on the dividends and other distributions it receives from its subsidiaries. The dividends that the Utilities may pay to Con Edison are limited by the NYSPSC to not more than 100 percent of their respective income available for dividends calculated on a two-year rolling average basis, with certain exceptions. See &#147;Dividends&#148; in Note C to the financial statements in Item 8. 
The Companies Require Access To Capital Markets To Satisfy Funding Requirements. The Utilities estimate that their construction expenditures will exceed $5 billion over the next three years. The Utilities expect to use internally-generated funds, equity contributions from Con Edison and external borrowings to fund the construction expenditures. The competitive energy businesses are evaluating opportunities to invest in renewable generation and energy-related infrastructure projects that would require funds in excess of those produced in the businesses. Con Edison expects to finance its capital requirements primarily through internally generated funds and the sale of its securities, including stock issuances under its dividend reinvestment and employee stock plans. Changes in financial market conditions or in the Companies&#146; credit ratings could adversely affect their ability to raise new capital and the cost thereof. See &#147;Capital Requirements and Resources&#148; in Item 1. 
The Internal Revenue Service Has Disallowed Substantial Tax Deductions Taken By The Company. The Companies&#146; federal income tax returns reflect certain tax positions with which the Internal Revenue Service does not or may not agree, particularly its tax positions for Con Edison&#146;s lease in/lease out transactions (see Note J to the financial statements in Item 8) and the deduction of the cost of certain repairs to utility plant for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility (see Note L to the financial statements in Item 8). 
The Companies Also Face Other Risks That Are Beyond Their Control. The Companies&#146; results of operations can be affected by circumstances or events that are beyond their control. Weather directly influences the demand for electricity, gas and steam

Information in any item of this report as to which reference is made in this Item 1A is incorporated by reference herein. The use of such terms as &#147;see&#148; or &#147;refer to&#148; shall be deemed to incorporate at the place such term is used the information to which such reference is made. 
The Companies&#146; businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, and that involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual operating results, cash flows and financial condition. 
The Companies have established an enterprise risk management program to identify, assess, and manage its major operations and administrative risks based on established criteria for the severity of an event, the likelihood of its occurrence, and the programs in place to control the event or reduce the impact. The Companies also have financial and commodity market risks. See &#147;Financial and Commodity Market Risks&#148; in Item 7. 
The Companies&#146; major risks include: 
The Failure to Operate Energy Facilities Safely and Reliably Could Adversely Affect The Companies. The Utilities provide electricity, gas and steam service using energy facilities, many of which are located either in, or close to, densely populated public places. See the description of the Utilities&#146; facilities in Item 1. A failure of, or damage to, these facilities, or an error in the operation or maintenance of these facilities, could result in bodily injury or death, property damage, the release of hazardous substances or extended service interruptions. In such event, the Utilities could be required to pay substantial amounts, which may not be covered by the Utilities&#146; insurance policies, to repair or replace their facilities, compensate others for injury or death or other damage, and settle any proceedings initiated by state utility regulators or other regulatory agencies. See &#147;Manhattan Steam Main Rupture&#148; in Note H to the financial statements in Item 8. The occurrence of such an event could also adversely affect the cost and availability of insurance. Changes to judicial doctrines could further expand the Utilities&#146; liability for service interruptions. See &#147;Utility Regulation &#150; State Utility Regulation, Liability for Service Interruptions&#148; in Item 1). 
The Failure To Properly Complete Construction Projects Could Adversely Affect The Companies. The Utilities&#146; ongoing construction program includes large energy transmission, substation and distribution system projects. The failure to properly complete these projects timely and effectively could adversely affect the Utilities&#146; ability to meet their customers&#146; growing energy needs with the high level of safety and reliability that they currently provide, which would adversely affect the Companies. 
The Companies Are Extensively Regulated And Are Subject To Penalties. The Companies&#146; operations require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental agencies. State utility regulators may seek to impose substantial penalties on the Utilities for violations of state utility laws, regulations or orders. In addition, the Utilities rate plans usually include penalties for failing to meet certain operating standards. FERC has the authority to impose penalties on the Utilities and the competitive energy businesses, which could be substantial, for violations of the Federal Power Act, the Natural Gas Act or related rules, including reliability rules. Environmental agencies may seek penalties for failure to comply with laws, regulations or permits. See &#147;Permit Non-Compliance and Pollution Discharges&#148; in Note H to the financial statements in Item 8. The Companies may also be subject to penalties from other regulatory agencies. The Companies may be subject to new laws, regulations, accounting standards or other requirements or the revision or reinterpretation of such requirements, which could adversely affect the Companies. See &#147;Utility Regulation&#148; and &#147;Environmental Matters &#150; Climate Change and Other Federal State and Local Environmental Provisions&#148; in Item 1 and &#147;Application of Critical Accounting Policies&#148; in Item 7.

The Internal Revenue Service Has Disallowed Substantial Tax Deductions Taken By The Company. The Companies&#146; federal income tax returns reflect certain tax positions with which the Internal Revenue Service does not or may not agree, 
The Companies Also Face Other Risks That Are Beyond Their Control. The Companies&#146; results of operations can be affected by circumstances or events that are beyond their control. Weather directly influences the demand for electricity, gas and steam service, and can affect the price of energy commodities. Natural disasters, such as a major storm, heat wave or hurricane (see &#147;Environmental Matters &#150; Climate Change&#148; in Item 1) or terrorist attacks or related acts of war could damage Company facilities. As a provider of essential utility services, the Utilities may experience more severe consequences from attempting to operate during and after such events. In addition, pandemic illness could potentially disrupt the Utilities&#146; employees and contractors from providing essential utility services. Economic conditions can affect customers&#146; demand and ability to pay for service, which could adversely affect the Companies.
